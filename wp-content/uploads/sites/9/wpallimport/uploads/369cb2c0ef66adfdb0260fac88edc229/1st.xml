<introtext><![CDATA['When I heard these words I sat down and wept...' Nehemiah 1:4 NRS<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150812.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Don’t feel like you’ve ever heard God’s clear–cut call for you? When you get an unshakeable sense of ‘I want to see change’ deep inside, you’re on to something. You might not feel like that about a particular issue right now but keep praying and you will. Let’s see what Nehemiah did when he heard God call him. The call to Nehemiah began with terrible news. God’s people were suffering and His holy city was destroyed. Nehemiah’s response was to sit down and weep. Bawl his eyes out. This is instinctive, natural and right. We talk a lot about being joyful in Church, but the Bible is also full of people weeping in response to the suffering they see. Their tears reflect God’s pain. When we see suffering, it *should* hurt us when we know it goes against the grain of God’s will for the world. And, before Nehemiah could even respond in sorrow, he had to hear the news. In the same way, we have to hear before we can respond. And to hear, we have to listen. We have to open our ears and hearts to news of places and people in need. We have to allow ourselves to be stirred, to feel discomfort. But, crucially, we’ve then got to follow it with action. Compassion is not just a feeling, it’s a response. Pick a situation around you or a story in the news you think needs to change, and take it to God and ask Him how and when you should get involved. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 16-18, Mark 5:21-30, Ps 119:49-56, Prov 21:4-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67728&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If it pleases the King... I ask...' Nehemiah 2:5 NRS <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150813.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Bring back to mind the situation or person you spent time thinking about yesterday. Time to work out how to respond. Nehemiah’s got this next step down. He asked for help, and not just from anyone. He went to the highest human authority available—the king. He felt no shame about appealing on behalf of his people to someone with some downright intimidating cred. Got a person or place on your heart? Don’t be ashamed to ask for help—or be too proud to ask those with power to help you. Some (in fact, most) tasks in God’s Kingdom will need more than a one–man band approach. Nehemiah knew he was doing the work of God, but he also knew that there were power structures in place that he had to work with to bring about Godly change. What’s more, the king he approached wasn’t a follower of God. The connections God will give you when you say ‘yes’ to His plan might not be ones you expect. Be open to His surprises. When God makes a way, He makes a way. So then, back to that situation or person you thought of yesterday. Who could you go to for help as you let God work in you? Is there someone in authority—a boss, a relative, a politician—you could ask? What support could they offer you? Are you brave enough to get on it? Share your concern for this place or person with at least one authority figure this week, and ask them for advice and support. You might be surprised by what they can do, and what support they offer you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 19:1-23:20, Mark 5:31-43, Ps 119:57-64, Prov 21:7-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67729&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They replied, &quot;Let us start rebuilding.&quot; So they began this good work.' Nehemiah 2:18 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150814.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Yesterday, we looked at sharing our call with others. After that, the best advice any of us will hear is simply: ‘make a start’. Taking the plunge is what stops your call from just being a dead–end. So why don’t we? We tell ourselves we don’t have the right things in place. Like: (1) ‘I’m not qualified’? Well, Kingdom work usually involves called (*not* qualified) people doing things they never dreamt of. (2) ‘People aren’t agreeing with me’? We’ll get into this tomorrow, but for now, know this: God’s people always get flak. David’s own brother took pot–shots at him before the Goliath fight, even calling him ‘evil’ (1 Samuel 17:28). (3) And what about ‘the timing isn’t right just yet’? Ecclesiastes 11:4 NIV says: ‘<em>Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap</em>.’ If you’re looking for a sign that the time is right, you might end up missing it. Whatever you need, don’t be afraid to ask. Nehemiah went for it—he shared his plan with some friends, got them to commit, and then they began. In fact, the whole of chapter 3 is just a list of the different people who helped Nehemiah in different ways. He was humble enough to ask for help, and bold enough to confidently share his plan, knowing that it was worthwhile. Can you support a Christian group who are facing seriously difficult opposition and spreading the Gospel anyway? Prayer is a significant need. Consider an organisation like opendoors.org.au </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 23:21-26:19, Mark 6:1-13, Ps 119:65-72, Prov 21:10-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67730&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of this Your servant...' Nehemiah 1:11 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150815.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Whether you have a clear–cut plan for the future or not, it’s always best to bring whatever we have to God in prayer. Often we’ve got a–million–and–one possible ideas for the future: excitement, back–up plans, ‘when I’ve got enough money’ plans... If that’s the boat you’re in, God will help you to narrow down the options, if you reciprocate that attentive ear thing (check out today’s verse), and listen right back to Him. Or perhaps, like a lot of us, you’re the opposite. The ‘what are you doing next year?’ question is one that haunts a lot of us, mostly because we’re pretty bad at getting hold of ideas for the futures. Wherever we find ourselves, it’s likely we’ll all benefit from a reminder: ‘…<em>along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light be-fore them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them</em>.’ (Isaiah 42:16 NIV) Whether the ‘darkness’ is the sea of choices you feel you have to wade through, or a sense of blankness about the future, God will be there. We’ll be taking a last look at Nehemiah’s wall–building capers tomorrow, but for now, remember how much prayer he put in before he went along with God’s plan. Be encouraged: it’s not an overnight process. Just bring what you have before Him, and leave the ball in His court. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 26:20-29:30, Mark 6:14-29, Ps 119:73-80, Prov 21:14-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67731&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other.' Nehemiah 4:17 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150816.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>So, Nehemiah took on God’s mission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Good on him. Couldn’t be much better and easier, right? Hmmm. Actually, he faced pretty tough opposition: heavy criticism and even threats to his life. The reality is, when we follow out a call God has for our lives (no matter how big or small), there may be opposition. You could find that you’ll be struggling to carry out that call. Opposition is exactly what Nehemiah’s workers were ready for; they were building with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. When you’ve got a deep sense of God’s approval and conviction for a call, it’s important to get yourself grounded in it. Keeping a journal of the times you’ve prayed, and the ways you’ve found God responds, is a good way of doing this (hey, if you haven’t got a journal, maybe it’s time to splash out on one?), as well as listing some helpful Bible verses. Then, when you find yourself facing opposition, maybe even from your own doubts, those words will become your Ephesians 6:17 style defence. Let’s take the whole ‘following God’s call’ thing seriously. We humans come alive when God gives us a mission. It’s so worth catching hold of God’s short and long term plans for our lives. Write a Bible verse about God’s protection down (let’s call it your sword–verse). Write one about how to build your life around Him on another piece of paper (your trowel–verse). Hold one in each hand, and pray for Him to direct you in His plan. Carry the verses with you today. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 31:31-37, Heb 8:1-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67732&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Yes, we can. This is exactly what 2 Chronicles tells us King Amaziah did. On the outside, he was doing all the right things, but his heart wasn’t in it. His heart was on his own agenda, his own desires. Hmmm. What’s that mean, then? First, a heart turned towards God, and towards serving others, is one that is wide open to God’s blessings. Our motives for doing things are, so often, mixed. The challenge for us, then, is this: ‘<em>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God</em>.’ (Matthew 5:8 NIV) In our service, if we strip back the bits that point to us rather than Him, we’re clearing up the airwaves to see Him more clearly and let His blessings in. It’s always good to consider where our heart is when we give. How often have we thought: ‘This will make me look good. I wonder how many people saw me do that?’ The beauty of it is that we don’t need to give so God will mark off a few more brownie points for us on a ticklist. ‘<em>God loves a cheerful giver</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 9:7 NIV) He really does. The giving of our money, time and energy can be from gratitude to His love for us. That’s a win–win for everyone involved—we don’t need to impress anyone, and our lives become bigger. So, let’s make sure our motives for giving are right. Assess your giving, assess your motives, and pray them all through. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 1-4, Mark 6:30-44, Ps 119:81-88, Prov 21:17-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67733&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Wise people are rewarded...' Proverbs 14:24 GNT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150818.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>A (very) brief summary of Proverbs 14: wisdom is the best. Without it, you’re like someone who tears their house down (verse 1), will ‘believe anything’ (verse 15), and have no qualms about making rash decisions that don’t honour God (verse 16). Sounds like it might be useful, then. As well as the big–scale school/university/work decisions we make, we are faced with hundreds of different everyday courses of action to take ourselves. Whether it’s that link you shouldn’t click, that impulse buy you didn’t need, that drinking game your flatmates are playing, it’s wisdom that gives us an insight into what will help us to build our lives best. Essentially, being wise will help us to keep putting God (and others) first, creating a solid foundation in life. Is it something we’re left alone to teach ourselves, then? Do we have to make a few terrible decisions first before eventually narrowing down what we should really be up to? Thankfully, this doesn’t have to be the case. For Solomon, a pretty wise bloke, wisdom was about admitting that handling life’s situations is best done with God at the reigns (yes, that’s wordplay), not us (1 Kings 3:9). When we humble ourselves and admit that we don’t always know what’s best, God will strengthen our conscience to start knowing which way to go. Now get that journal (didn’t grab one the day before yesterday? Go grab one now... Good work.) Now, open it up and make two lists: one of what you want to learn and improve in yourself this month, and one of people or places you want to help practically and generously this month. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 5-7, Mark 6:45-56, Ps 119:89-96, Prov 21:20-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67734&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Share in the troubles we have like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.' 2 Timothy 2:3 NCV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150819.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>There are certain tactics the enemy will try use to get under our skin. Perhaps you’re feeling pressure from friends and family, or your own heart and head fill you with doubts, anxieties and temptations. It’s a serious matter, but sticking close to God gives us real strength when it comes to resisting Satan. The next few days are committed to helping us triumph when the carrot of giving up is dangling in front of us. Sometimes the world’s moving goalposts when it comes to morality are a constant temptation. Jesus spent a lot of time teaching us not to be anxious about getting by, but to influence the world as ‘<em>salt</em>’ and ‘<em>light</em>’ (Matthew 5:13–14). As hard as it is, ‘<em>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world</em>.’ (James 1:27 ESV) Corruption leads to distancing from God. Wince. Good news: none of us can survive on our own. In this letter to Timothy—a young Christian preparing to face the difficulties of leading a church and staying faithful to God’s call—Paul reminds him that, just as good soldiers will share the burdens and struggles of their mates, we should do the same. It is an encouragement to know that we can call on other Christians to step up and support us, to have our backs, and to feel our pain with us. It’s our duty too to do the same for others. So, encourage someone who needs it today. Share in their troubles, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 8-11, Mark 7:1-13, Ps 119:97-104, Prov 21:24-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67735&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Make no provision for the flesh...' Romans 13:14 NAS<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150820.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>In Paul’s letter to the Church in Rome, he brings up a hugely important factor in the battle against Satan. Something that can, but really shouldn’t, be an elephant in the room—letting ourselves indulge in things (often secretly) that don’t honour God. Each day, we’re faced with a choice to ‘<em>cast off the works of darkness</em>.’ (Romans 13:12 ESV) We’ll be blunt here: if you’ve got a niggle that something might be a hindrance to you, it probably is. We can all think of things that we don’t want to (or don’t know how to) let go of. That website? That ego–boosting slice of gossip? Those thoughts? Behind the temptation to keep hold of those things and use them, there’s a much better life that God has called us to as a ‘<em>new creation</em>’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) in Him. To back that up with some serious God–protection, it’s vital to build our relationship with God, regardless of how well or badly we feel we’re doing—He invites us to <em>‘pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion.</em>’ (Ephesians 6:18 NLT) This makes it harder for just–this–one–time things to slip under the radar. God doesn’t need us to be perfect (which is good, since we aren’t), but cutting back the things that hinder you will change your life. Is it time for you to find an accountability partner? Choose someone who you can be honest with. Commit to regularly keep each other in check about the thing–(or things)–to–stop–doing that came to mind today. If you can, pray for each other too. Let’s get each others’ backs. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 12-15, Mark 7:14-23, Ps 119:105-112, Prov 21:28-31 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67736&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed is he who considers the poor...' Psalm 41:1 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>The three richest people on the planet have more collective wealth than the combined gross national product of the world’s 48 poorest countries. You’re probably not in that league when it comes to earnings, but that’s no excuse for not giving. General Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, said: ‘How can you convince a man of the love of God if his feet are perishing with the cold?’ Meeting people at their point of need is something Jesus did. For Him, healing and helping people went hand–in–hand with telling them about God. Giving our money, time and energy is a great thing to be doing for God. First, it’s a huge pointer to Him because, when people see our generosity, then it directs them to praise God (2 Corinthians 9:13). Secondly, giving changes our lives, too. When we open up our hearts and piggybanks to God’s way of looking at life, including His perspective on giving, we see massive blessing. In fact (and thirdly), Isaiah tells us that, sometimes, the reason our prayers aren’t answered is because we’ve been selfish when we saw others in need. ‘<em>Remove the... yoke of injustice and let the oppressed go free. Share your food with the hungry and open your homes to the homeless poor. Give clothes to those who have nothing to wear… Then My favour will shine on you…and your wounds will be quickly healed. I will always be with you to save you; My presence will protect you on every side. When you pray, I will answer you.</em>’ (Isaiah 58:6–9 GNT) What’s something practical you can do for a needy person today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Christ... left you an example, so that you would follow in His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 GNT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>God designed us to be a window to Him (see Genesis 1:26 for details). When we take a deep look at God’s character and His actions, we get a good indicator of what people should see when we’re showcasing Him well. Mostly, however, they get a pretty murky view. Thankfully, we don’t have to clean ourselves all in our own strength! We can ask God to show us how to be a window. What we’re talking about here is a process called ‘sanctification’, where God turns you round in a more–and–more Christlike direction. Want to know the most amazing bit? That started behind the scenes before we ever knew Him. Wow. Then, it fires up all the more when we commit to join Him in His work. We begin to look more like Him—the way we were made to be. So… can you now say: ‘Thanks for the theology lesson <em>word4U</em>, I’ll guess I’ll sit around and be sanctified all day now, no effort needed’? Hmmm… you guessed it: no. We’re asked to follow Jesus—an action. Colossians 1:15 says we’re made in the likeness of God, and Jesus is the only ready–made Likeness of the Father. In Him, we’re given a living blueprint for taking hold of our cleaned–up lives. That’s why we’re called to live like Jesus and why He’s our example. Think of one area of your life that needs to look more like that Godly–blueprint. Pray about it, and come back to it whenever it crosses your mind. God will work in you when you ask Him to.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...now is the day of salvation.' 2 Corinthians 6:2 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Over the next few days we’re going to be thinking about when God works, where God works, and how God works—and where we fit into all of those things. Today’s verse answers the question: ‘When is God working?’ with an emphatic, triumphant, urgent ‘Now! What are you waiting for?’ Now, it’s really good to ‘<em>wait on the Lord</em>’, and take time to pause and ask God where He wants us to be. Excellent stuff. Do that. But it’s also good to be wary of putting things off—waiting for a sign from Heaven or waiting for the ‘perfect time’ to chat to someone about Jesus can be procrastination. God can work through us, whether there’s a ‘green light’ showing or not about that ‘perfect time’. (In fact, funny thing about ‘perfect times’ for things: they don’t tend to ever show up). Paul reminds the Corinthian church that salvation is happening now—that now is the time to accept it, to start living in it, and to share it. In the next couple of days we’ll be taking a look at the encounter of two disciples with a man ‘<em>who was lame from birth</em>.’ (Acts 3:2 NIV) They shared the ‘salvation’ they’d found in God. Not only the eternal salvation available through belief in Jesus and His death and resurrection, but the right–now ‘salvation’ from a disability that had kept the man from experiencing ‘<em>life in all its fullness</em>.’ (John 10:10 NCV) Been putting something (maybe especially a Jesus–related thing) off? Decide to do it, or at least start it, today. Ask God about it first, then give it a start, and see how it goes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...A man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate...to beg.' Acts 3:2 NIV<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>In Acts chapter 3 there’s some really good news—God’s work isn’t limited to a certain time or place. It tells the story of Peter and John’s encounter with a man who couldn’t walk, at a city gate. It all started out as a normal day for this bloke. It’s likely the disciples would have passed this man many times before. Perhaps he was simply part of the background of the streets where they walked. And yet—on this particular afternoon, something different happened. This opportunity for the work of God suddenly arrived, right in a gateway the disciples passed through almost every day. Lesson time: first, don’t draw a line as to where you think God can work (check out 1 Chronicles 29:11). Prayer meetings? Bible study? Those spiritual parts of life are great but, if you feel as though you’re limping through your day–in–day–out life, know that God’s healing hand stretches to the gate (or wherever you find yourself), too. Just like the man who was healed, when we call out, God will provide. Secondly, God’s provision will get you back on your feet, no matter how slowly. Like the man, we often look for short term help, but God wants to do more than just provide a crutch for the issues that hold us down. Be bold today. Cry out to Him. Ask for healing. And ask for the opportunity to bring healing into the lives of others, just as Peter and John did.</p>

<p>So, Peter and John got the picture. God is working through you and me (His disciples). That’s the role they took on as they extended their hands to people on the street. Disclaimer: God’s way of working might not match ours. The two disciples were on their way to a pretty important prayer meeting: ‘…<em>Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon</em>.’ (Acts 3:1 NIV) That prayer meeting took a back seat, though, when God showed how He wanted to work that day. Wherever we’re heading, God will point us to those hurting, needy, aren’t–saying–much individuals who weren’t on today’s list of notifications. Peter dropped what he was doing and let God redirect him towards helping a man who couldn’t walk: ‘<em>Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up.</em>’ (Acts 3:7 NIV) Those disciples were blessed, too, not just the man at the gate. The moment when their hands met—that’s the moment the Church, the body of Christ, became the arm of God at work. Jesus calls us to be His hands and feet in today’s world. And here’s a beautiful thing—He tells us that ‘<em>whatever you do for the least of these... you did for Me</em>.’ (Matthew 25:40 NIV) It’s as if, to Peter and John, the man lying at the gate is Jesus. And Peter and John, ex-tending their hands to him, are being Jesus to the man. THAT is God at work, transforming both those in need, and the ones who seek to help. Ready for a prophetic action? Write ‘Jesus’ on your hand. Use that hand to help as many people up as you can today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I require...the first-fruits and the choicest of your contributions....' Ezekiel 20:40 AMP<br /><br /></p>
<p>God gave the prophet Ezekiel a picture of what it will look like when God’s relationship with His people is fixed: He’ll call them to His holy mountain, gather His people to Him—and they will offer Him the best of what they have (‘first fruits’ of the harvest). At this time in Bible history, God’s people were the Jewish people. They took this picture to heart—their law required that they offer the first fruits of harvest to God, to worship Him and remind themselves that everything came from Him. As it rolled out, they weren’t always that great at putting Him first. All they needed to do was make Him their priority (not their own selfish ambition), and they could enjoy being close to Him, but they cut corners left and right. Most of us can think of situations where we’ve done the same, forgetting that ‘my gifts are not my gifts; they belong to God.’ God’s love doesn’t depend on how well we live this out. So, because His love is so freely given, let’s try to do this well. A good way to do this? Kick it off by giving back to God the first bit of His most basic gift—the day you get to be alive in. So set your alarm 10 minutes earlier to start tomorrow with a prayer of commitment. (Hate mornings? Do it anyway… you’ve got to get up sometime.) Start your morning with words like the Psalmist: ‘<em>You are my God. My times are in Your hands</em>.’ (Psalm 31:14–15 AMP) That’s one way to focus the rest of your day on Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He...saw...evidence of the grace of God.' Acts 11:23 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>‘Grace’. You don’t often hear it used outside of church but, boy, do you hear it a lot there. What does it even mean? As a noun, the dictionary describes grace as ‘courteous good will’. Sounds quite Christian. But in the Bible, ‘grace’ is about more than just good manners. So, what does the Bible say? Peter wrote we should be growing in ‘grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.’ (2 Peter 3:18 NIV) Grace is simply God giving us what we don’t deserve. Growing in grace refers to our transformation from what we used to be into what He is making us to because of His goodness that He has undeservingly lavished on us. When we say that a person is ‘full of grace’ we don’t mean full like a tankard of coffee (though, come to think of it, tankard of coffee… mmm). The grace given to us doesn’t just stay inside. We can make the choice to let it overflow into the world around us. Jesus has already given us more than enough in His forgiveness and acceptance of us (throwback to yesterday, anyone?) That fuels our everyday lives—it’s why 2 Peter encourages us to know more about it. The more we know of it, the more we change the way we see things and respond to the world around us—places and people where there could be more of God’s presence and work. To remind yourself of what it means to be full of grace: get a mug and a stick it under the tap. Fill the mug, and keep on filling until it’s pouring over the sides into the sink. Here’s a visual of ‘full of grace’—lavishly sharing out and out and out to others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Don't excuse yourself by saying, &quot;Look, we didn't know.&quot;' Proverbs 24:12 NLT <br /><br /></p>
<p>‘I’m washing my hair,’ ‘I’m doing my homework,’ ‘I’m vacuuming my cat.’ All excuses we’ve used before to get out of a variety of things. (Maybe not the cat one; we tried it once and nobody believed us). But what about when we’re trying to get out of taking responsibility for something? Ouch. That stuff can sting quite badly. When we’ve hurt a friend, left someone out or made a really bad choice. It can be so hard to hold up our hands and say, ‘You know what? My bad.’ But sometimes, it’s the only way to move on. Proverbs 12:22 ESV says: ‘Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are His delight.’ God actually delights in seeing us do the right thing. That doesn’t mean that doing the right thing will be an easy ride, but it does mean that when we’ve messed up and we are willing to take responsibility we are bringing honour to God. On the flipside, when we use today’s verse as our script for sticky situations, no matter how many people believe you, God sees our motivation for excuses. When we’re willing to swallow our pride and own up, we are pointing our lives in a God–ward direction—everyone’s a winner. Ephesians 4:26 NIV says: ‘Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.’ Use that as a challenge today; seek to put things right with your family and friends before you go to bed tonight. It might be tough, and it might be a long time before a relationship is repaired, but take the first step towards it today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Though it cost you all you have, get understanding.' Proverbs 4:7 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ahh, Proverbs. Many pearls of wisdom. But, here’s the thing—it’s only full of wisdom when you read it, use it and do something about it. God’s Word was never meant to be a bunch of letters on a page shoved in a bookcase somewhere. It was always intended to be truth, wisdom and promise. And that means that we need to bring those things into the world by living them out. Wisdom can seem like a theoretical thing, but it’s totally not. It’s a basis of real, solid understanding—an understanding that equips us to live out God’s plans and commands. You wouldn’t expect a vacuum cleaner to keep your house clean when it’s left in the cupboard under the stairs; it’s the same with your Bible (not sure why we’ve mentioned vacuums two days in a row, clearly some of us have a guilty conscience…and a very dusty floor). If you want to get the most out of your Bible and start living out your faith, you’ve got to get it out daily. In Proverbs 1:5 NIV it says: ‘Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance.’ The original word used here for learning is ‘leqach’, which is connected with the idea of taking something. Basically, what Proverbs is getting at is that we have to take wisdom from God. He’s the Almighty source of wisdom, He embodies wisdom itself, so anytime we’re struggling with something, He’s the One to go to. Remember memory verses? It’s old school, but it’s a good way of allowing Scripture to permeate your life and impact the way you see things. Learn a (useful for you) verse from Proverbs by heart this week.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>We see so much of people serving in church (in welcome teams, in coffee rosters, handing out hymn books on the way in and so on) that we can sometimes lose touch with the word ‘servant’. We become desensitised to the whole idea and just end up assuming that it’s all about how often we stack the chairs. But being a servant in God’s eyes is less about the actual acts we do (though they are important), and more about the attitude we bring. You see, if we stack the chairs at church but get home and whinge about it, we’ve completely missed the point. Cue a great verse in Paul’s letter to the people of Philippi: ‘Do everything without complaining or arguing.’ (Philippians 2:14 GWT) Everything? Yep. Look at it this way, can you imagine Jesus saying ‘I really don’t feel like doing that today, God.’ He was willing to be a servant, willing to do as the Father asked Him, even if that meant a rough deal. It’s tough, but it’s who God calls us to be. Galatians 5:13 NIV says: ‘You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.’ God made you free so that you could serve. Use that freedom. Grab someone who looks like they might be need a hand, even the old man next door who can’t push his mower around, and ask what you can do to lend a hand. Even the smallest of odd–jobs is an opportunity to exercise your God–given freedom and be a servant.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Be very careful, then, how you live.' Ephesians 5:15 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>‘You only live once.’ It’s easy to be cynical about this and other nice t–shirt slogans like: ‘Live for today’, ‘When life gives you lemons, make lemonade’, ‘carpe diem’ and all that other stuff. But, hold up, maybe there’s something in this whole ‘seize the day’ business that we shouldn’t so casually dismiss it. Ecclesiastes 9:9 NIV says: ‘Enjoy life with your wife.’ Now THAT we can see on a t–shirt (mainly because it rhymes). But it goes on to say: ‘For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labour under the sun.’ Wow. Not so t–shirt friendly after all? There’s some meaty stuff behind the message. In Luke 9:62 NIV, a man says, ‘I will follow You, Lord, but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.’ Jesus replies, ‘No one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the Kingdom of God.’ There’s a ‘seize the day’ message if ever there was one. Maybe you’ve noticed: any Instagram–filtered–poster–pic type slogans that we can grab from the Bible tend to be paired with some real kickers. They’re not just nice platitudes or motivational quips. Yes, God is all for the ‘seize the day’ mentality, but look again at the reason. Because we can’t put God’s Kingdom off until later. We have to be prepared to step up today. To make today (and the direction of our lives) more about God than ourselves, to serve in whatever immediate way we can. Don’t put it off. Simple. Choose one little thing you can do today that will grow God’s Kingdom. Go for it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He will empower you with inner strength.' Ephesians 3:16 NLT</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever watched a superhero film and been convinced you must have superpowers you haven’t discovered yet? No? Oh c’mon, you know you have. As much as we can close our eyes and convince ourselves we can teleport from our desk to New York, sometimes we can feel pretty weak. In fact, the latter’s the more common, right? We’ve all had moments of sheer helplessness, where it’s almost impossible to get out of bed because we’re physi-cally/emotionally exhausted. As hard as it is, you can trust Him. If you’re willing to step out, His power goes with you. Isaiah 40:29 NIV says: ‘He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.’ That’s pretty incredible encouragement, right? We may not have teleportation powers (though don’t count the possibility out… check Acts 8:39–40, God did it once), but that verse from Isaiah tells us that, even in our weakest moments, we have power that God will build on. It means that we don’t have to live in exhaustion and weakness. God has the amazing power to take everything that wears us down, and free us from it. He’s ready and willing to help you, if you’ll bring it all before Him. That also goes for when you’re not allowing yourself to feel weak. When you’re convincing yourself that you can do it alone, you’re denying God the right to carry you and strengthen you. Allow Him in, He knows what He’s doing. And every time you see a picture of a superhero, remember the Super-Power (God) that goes before you and the strength that God provides.&amp;nbsp;</p>

Colossians 3:2 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150730.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Matthew 6:24 NIV says: ‘You cannot serve both God and money.’ Right. Not a problem. Buying a few new t–shirts, when we already have a full ward-robe, isn’t ‘serving money’, is it? Possibly not. There’s nothing wrong in buying stuff. But we would ask you this… Did you ask God what He wanted you to do with that cash before splashing it? Now, this is NOT a guilt trip. Promise. It’s a reality check. Some inspiration to move forwards with. And it’s inspiration that we all need. We’ve all got to get our priorities straight. Everything we’ve got is a gift from God anyway. Our very lives, and everything in them, are given by Him, so we have a definite duty to invite Him to shine through them. That means offering everything back to Him, as soon as it lands in our lap (or, even, once we’ve worked our snowflake–patterned Christmas–in–July socks off for it). Whether it’s the $100 birthday money from granny, or the $2 you just found on the floor, God loves it when you give it back to Him. He won’t necessarily tell you to give $102 to charity/church/the homeless guy in town. He may just ask you to give a portion to one of them. But, if you take all your money to Him, you accept the risk that He may tell you to give away what’s left over, after you’ve paid your bills. In fact, scratch that, you don’t just ‘accept’ that risk. You’ll learn to delight in the God–given hazard of generosity. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Mark 1:35-45, Ps 78:17-31, Prov 19:27-29 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67253&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'What do you have in your house?' 2 Kings 4:2 NIV</p>
<p>It can be brilliant when you get a direct answer to prayer through another person. But, have you ever considered the fact that you could actually be the answer to someone else’s prayers? Seriously, think about what you have to offer. God equips each one of us with gifts to bless other people. Find yourself on your knees in prayer fairly often? Great! Sometimes, when we get up and walk back into ‘the world’, we’re a walking answer to prayer (see Isaiah 52:7 for further details). Maybe you’re pretty good at just listening, or perhaps you’re great at cheering people up. In Luke 6:38 KJV Jesus said: ‘Give, and it shall be given unto you.’ Now, that doesn’t mean that you’ll always get a good deal. There will be people who let you down and take more than they give. But, God promises that when we commit to serving one another, He will honour us. John 12:26 NIV says: ‘My Father will honour the one who serves Me.’ And as long as we’re seeking God’s honour (rather than the self–gratification of being praised for being an amazing friend), we’re on the right track. Sit down with a Christian friend and chat about what you think they bring into people’s lives (even if it’s just that they can make you laugh till you cry… wait, that shouldn’t be ‘just’—that’s an awesome gift). Then ask them to tell you what you bring into people’s lives. You might be surprised by how much of a blessing you truly are.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word...' 1 Peter 2:2 NKJ</p>
<p>How many times have you crashed with a friend and, instead of eating dinner, you’ve gorged on chocolate and crisps? At the time it feels good, but after a few hours, you start to wonder if ‘fibre’ or ‘vitamins’ might be a good shout. The headaches start. The stomach lurches. You start to feel both too full and strangely empty at the same time. Peter’s getting at something similar in these verses. Our soul is crying out for nourishment. The temptation to go looking for that soul–nourishment in places other than God’s Word can be really strong. We don’t always notice ourselves doing it. Malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, evil speaking (1 Peter 2:1); they’re quick fixes, and can give the short–lived illusion that they’re just what we need to feel full. (In that moment when we give in to nastiness, we can feel satisfied in a guilty kind of way... until we spiritually sober up and catch what we’re doing.) But, they don’t provide us with the proper fruit and veg spiritual nourishment we really long for. God gives a full list of His culinary recommendations in Galatians 5:22–23. Yep, the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self–control. Truth is, it’s not always easy to choose to eat healthily. But the nifty thing is: we can pray for the right kind of healthy hunger. So go for it! Ask: ‘Lord, give me a hunger for Your nourishment through Your Word in Scripture.’ Then decide: which fruit of the Spirit is going to be part of your diet today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...You are Mine.' Isaiah 43:1 NKJ</p>
<p>‘For I am yours… and you are mine.’ Yeah, ok, it might seem like a bit of a greetings–card cliché. But what about when we sing it in worship? We might know in our heads that we belong to Jesus. But really knowing that we belong to Jesus, in our hearts, can be a different matter. What does it mean? What difference does it make to how our lives look? The real sense of value that comes from knowing you’re a child of God doesn’t come from all the nice things He gives you. In fact, any material ‘thing’ can disappear at any time. God’s declaration that you are His, that you are significant because of that, isn’t a promise that He’s going to give you a free pass when it comes to troubles. His is a more lasting significance and a promise to be with you in those troubles: ‘<em>I have called you by your name; you are Mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you. When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned…For I am the Lord your God…you are precious in My eyes</em>.’ (Isaiah 43:1–4 ESV) You are precious. Not what you’ve got, or what you have done—you. When your sense of significance is an inside job, rather than based on external things, nothing can touch it.</p>

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p><br />When you realise someone likes you as you are, it’s pretty great. Even when someone sheepishly says, ‘I maybe sorta kinda like you,’ it’s a massive confidence boost, right? It doesn’t even have to be romantic. It can be as straightforward as that person, the one you respect more than anyone, complimenting what you’ve done. It sticks with us when we know we’re appreciated. And that’s just when fellow humans value us! What about God? Yes, the God of creation, the same God who named the stars (Psalm 147:4) thinks more highly of you than He does the stars. Jesus says: ‘...<em>the very hairs on your head are all numbered</em>.’ (Matthew 10:30 NKJ) Your adoring fans might know your eye colour, what flavour you like your latté, or your favourite film. But the amount of hair on your head? Nah. God knows every detail about you, and loved you even before you knew Him (Ephesians 1:4). What does all this mean? God appreciates you. A lot. He values you more than you can imagine. The things that make you ‘you’ are given huge weight because of that. It’s good to remember that the best compliment, or the most alluring romance, can’t touch the significance you’ve already been given. And it’s good to remember that ‘re–member’ literally means to put back together again. Like Humpty Dumpty. So when you recollect and remember that God has made you, you’re doing something really wonderful. Particularly if you’re feeling fractured or broken today, find somewhere to be quiet and remember, and let Him put you back together again.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...The Lord raises those who are bowed down...' Psalm 146:8 NKJ</p>
<p>That significance in God that we’ve been focusing on these last two days—yes, it can be shaken, especially when we do things that make us think we’re suddenly unclean again. But only in our heads. Even when we know we’ve messed up, God looks past what we’ve done and into our future. Open your Bible (app?) to John 4, where Jesus met the woman at the well. While the rest of the town slandered her because of her shady past, Jesus offered her a new life. God knows it’s sometimes hard to see beyond what we’ve done, so He meets us right where we are. At the well, or the workplace, or school or your worried mind, He’s there. He told the woman this: <em>‘Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst</em>.’ (John 4:13–14) Your significance? You might feel like it has taken a knock, but your self–worth is fulfilled in Jesus—you don’t need to keep ‘thirsting’ after other people’s approval of you. In fact, God loves to show us that even in our lowest moments, He is there. Psalm 146:8 NKJ says: ‘<em>The Lord raises those who are bowed down</em>.’ When you’re humble to accept that His way (and He Himself) is the best way forward, He’ll pick you up and show you your significance, wherever you’ve fallen down. So, whenever cruel words come at you, especially come from your own mind, remember what God really says about you. (Reread yesterday’s message, if your memory’s as bad as ours is...)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.' Ecclesiastes 12:14 NKJ</p>
<p>God’s omniscience (that’d be His all–knowingness) gets a lot of bad press from time to time. Ever heard someone advise: ‘Don’t do that. God’s watching’? As if He’s nothing more than a security guard with seven billion screens trying to catch us out every other second. But if we understand that God is love—which He is—we can really understand His all–knowingness. So often when we sin, we’re hesitant to go back to God. But the reality is that He knows everything already—He knows the worst and the best about us; He sees our innermost thoughts. We can bury our motivations and thinking so deeply, they’re hidden even from ourselves. But we can’t hide them from God. Ultimately that’s good news. We don’t have to live in fear of Him coming back to discover our mess and, in shocked horror, send us to bed without dinner. He already sees the mess, and He’s ready to deal with it lovingly. We just have to take it to Him. And while we need to go back to Him to sort out that sin, we can approach Him with confidence, knowing that Jesus has already done everything necessary to restore us to God in the first place. So—right now and in a properly Christ–like way—go clean up a mess that you didn’t make. And, if whoever did make it is around, show them real grace about it. No grumbling or fuss–making.</p>

He created something as delicately precise as atoms, neurons and quarks. He created something as grand and supersized as the IC1101 galaxy, which is estimated as 100 thousand light years across. God created Shakespeare and Picasso and your next door neighbour. The Piano Key butterfly gets a name from a stunning keyboard tattooed to its wings—again the work of Creator God. The shark, the wombat, jelly trifles, soap bubbles—they were all modelled at the hand of God. You get the idea: God is creative. Well, the Bible teaches we are made in the image of God—so if God is creative… yep, good guess, so are we. Ok, maybe you tend to colour outside the lines, sing like a strangled bullfrog or run like a demented crab—but in other unique ways you will reflect God’s creativity. Styling hair could be your thing. Or unravelling an equation. Or curling a free–kick. Or dissecting an aneurysm. Or turning over a sentence. Creativity doesn’t just happen in the art room. To some, God reveals beauty in mathematical sequences and scientific formulae; to others, He shows up in drama or paintings. However we’ve been wired; we’ve all received ‘creativity’. Not sure about that? You don’t have to class yourself as a ‘creative type’ to be able to bring ideas up that will bless people—we all have ways to reflect God’s creativity. When you tap into God’s creativity, He helps you see things not as they are, but as they can be. Today, do three creative things, in your own God–given way. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 1:1-4:16, Matt 25:31-46, Ps 79, Prov 17:24-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67232&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be transformed by...renewing...your mind.' Romans 12:2 NKJ<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150710.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Romans 12 tells us to let the Holy Spirit transform us by ‘renewing...your mind.’ We can sometimes cringe at the notion of doing something that ‘isn’t me’. We tend to carve out a comfortable little possie for ourselves and that’s how the world comes to see us. And we buy into the world’s view! So when God comes along and tells the person who could never speak in class to preach to a large congregation, it’s hard to think anyone will take that seriously. Sometimes, though, we’re asked to challenge those expectations. God made us with purpose, value, dignity and worth, but along the way He’s still going to need to step in and grow us. As that emerges, of course we’re going to change. It’s practically a necessity if He’s fulfilling His purposes in us. When we don’t have the power or energy to change our own self–image, God does. In fact, whenever He calls us to do things we don’t see ourselves being capable of, He transforms us so that we can do whatever is needed. Like Op-timus Prime, we can be renewed and restored, and will come back kicking, with new Energon–like energy and power (perhaps minus the painted–on flames, though?) It’s not always easy to change others’ first impressions of us. We can don glasses but people won’t think we’re smarter. And, it can be even harder to change our own impression of ourselves. With God, though, real change happens. And those changes will eventually shine through. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 4:17-6:24, Matt 26:1-13, Ps 109:1-15, Prov 17:27-28 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67233&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['May they be brought to complete unity.' John 17:23 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150711.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Truth time. We may not like to admit it, but sometimes we can subconsciously believe that we’re ‘better’ than someone else because we got this grade or that job. Our Church denomination is better or our social class is higher. John 17:23 tells us that God wants His children to be unified, and unity doesn’t allow for judgment. We can ignore lecturers and tolerate seemingly–silly ideas, with a forced smile, but our opinion of that other person has gone down. When this happens, immediately we’ve separated ourselves in spirit because of a difference of opinion. But we’re supposed to be different. God wants His children to be unified—but not by all being clones of each other. That said, ‘complete unity’ seems a tall order, doesn’t it? It is. Let’s be honest, it isn’t so easy to be unified with that guy who’s always one–upping you. We’ve all heard a bunch of talks or sermons about accepting people’s differences. We (probably) all agree with that rationally, and even in practice. What we’re likely to neglect is making accommodation in our mind for those who have a different way of thinking to us (ever got frustrated with someone who doesn’t do things your way?) That’s harder. But unity demands we learn to make room for others and respect their convictions. ‘Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.’ (Romans 14:5 NIV) When you hear someone air an idea that opposes one of yours today, consider whether you’re actually listening, or if you’re just planning a lecture (even a silent–mental–lecture) entitled: ‘This is why you’re wrong.’ Really listen to what they say, and turn it into a fair conversation. You might learn something. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 1:1-3:21, Matt 26:14-25, Ps 109:16-31, Prov 18:1-3 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67234&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Well, your Mum told you that sprouts were good for you a million times but did you eat them? Yeah. See what we mean? Christians talk about loving each other all the time because it’s important. It’s one thing to know you should be unified, it’s another to put aside pettiness and actually work for it. What we do affects other people whether we think about it or not, and quite often, when we inadvertently hurt someone, we feel awful. Or we can try to justify it: We were ‘only following the rules’. But when somebody else’s action affects us, we don’t tend to offer the same courtesy we offer ourselves. We attribute blame and assume that we know that their intention was to hurt us. For some reason, we don’t expect from others the same human weaknesses that we have. Jesus told us that love trumps everything. Paul said, ‘Everything is permissible—but not everything is beneficial.’ (1 Corinthians 10:23 NIV) He was talking about doing things that are ok but that other people might find offensive. And he basically says: think twice... then think again. Holding onto the view ‘but I did nothing wrong’ for the sake of offended pride is not on. Holding onto the spirit of Scripture that Jesus taught (again, love) is on. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 14:18-20, Ps 110, Heb 5:5-11 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67235&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

John 15:4 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150713.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Jesus tells us straight up that our successes lie in Him. End of story. Unless we’re doing things in His name and with His backing, it’s not going to work out. We have a problem when we try to emulate Jesus, without Jesus. A lot goes into the running of a Church and, when you get to a certain point in your Church life, you might think about helping out. That’s brilliant. It’s a great thing to want to use your talent with technology to set up the sound equipment, or to use your awesome coffee–making–and–smiling–at–the–same–time skills in joining the refreshment team. Sometimes, though, we can get caught up in wanting to help. Suddenly, we’re on twelve different rotas and we never actually get to sit and listen to a sermon. We’re doing all these things for God, but if we’re not building our relationship with Him, then we lose track of why we’re doing those things in the first place. James 2:26 famously says that ‘faith without works is dead’. But works without faith aren’t alive, either. They become a façade, sometimes even an at-tempt to buy favour with God! It doesn’t matter if you look like a Super Christian outwardly, if you’re not right with God inwardly. When we stop doing things in Him, we can’t succeed, and our efforts become meaningless. Spend an hour today not doing anything but waiting on God. No matter how much work you have to do, clear your schedule just for one hour. Sit with your Bible and a pen, and maybe some Spirit–focussed music. But just *be* in that hour, don’t worry about *doing* anything. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, Matt 26:26-35, Ps 118:1-9, Prov 18:4-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67236&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord has need of him.' Luke 19:34 NKJ<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150714.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>When you’re a Christian it’s less–than–great not knowing how God wants to use you. When people all around are talking about their callings and all’s quiet on the Heaven–front for you, it can be disheartening. But remember that story about the colt Jesus rode into Jerusalem? That colt had never been ridden and was tied to a tree, overlooked and underestimated by the people around him. But Jesus had ‘need of him’ and knew the right time to call for him. Now, you’re not a baby horse (or a baby goat. Neigh, we kid you not), but the same applies in your life. You’ve heard that God has a plan for you and you may be wondering what that is (or not; if you already know, then that’s prettyyyy cool). However we have to remember that plans run on a schedule and, unlike ours, God’s plans tend to stay on schedule. He’s going to call you when He knows the time is right. That can be difficult to accept, but let’s face it, God’s plan is better than anything we could come up with. Jesus was never influenced by other people’s opinions. It didn’t matter that the colt was overlooked or the prostitute was looked down upon or that everyone hated the taxman, Jesus still loved them and had a purpose for them. He knows your value better than others do, and better than you do. So, try this reminder: when you’re making tea tonight, stop cooking halfway through and see if you’d want to eat it. Bet you’d rather wait until it’s cooked and ready. Some things you just have to wait for. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 7:18-11:27, Matt 26:36-46, Ps 118:10-18, Prov 18:7-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67237&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe...and it will be yours.' Mark 11:24 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br />{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150715.mp3{/mp3remote}<br /><p>Let’s pray. Hands together. Sound like a familiar instinct? If you were taught to pray as a kid, it’s probably muscle memory. You likely also felt that rush of rebellion as you sneakily took a peek around the assembly hall to see if anyone ‘wasn’t praying right.’ But you’ve probably realised that God doesn’t care if your hands are together, at your sides, or raised in the air. Prayer isn’t about hand placement. There’s a cool thought from William Ward: ‘We stamp and address an envelope and send it on its way with complete confidence that it will reach its destination. Yet we wonder and even doubt if our prayers will be heard by an ever–present, ever–loving God.’ When Peter told a man who couldn’t walk to get up and go, it didn’t happen because he thought, half–heartedly, ‘Meh, might as well give it a go.’ It happened because he knew that God has real power, and would answer his prayer. God rewarded Peter’s sincere faith. We can get caught up in the words of a prayer or the length of it. It can be hard to remember that prayer is just a way of telling God that we’re ready and believing. Peter simply said, ‘In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk’ (Acts 3:6 ESV), and it happened. God knows already what we want to say. So pray in a way you’re comfortable with, and keep an eye out for answers. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 12:1-14:20, Matt 26:47-56, Ps 118:19-29, Prov 18:10-12 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67238&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'When you pray, go into your room, close the door.' Matthew 6:6 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>We’ve all been in that situation: in church (or youth group or life group...) and somebody’s been praying when suddenly you’re saying ‘Amen’ with no idea what the prayer was about. Your mind wandered. Again. Oops. Today we’re not usually very good at putting all of our attention on one thing. We listen to music while we work, we watch sitcoms while we clean. We’re not always great with staying focused on God when there’s a billion other things going on around us. Sometimes, we fall asleep before we reach Amen. If you relate, don’t worry, you’re not a bad Christian, and you’re definitely not the only one who does that sort of thing. Turns out God knows us pretty well, He foresaw all of that, and gave us some handy tips via the Bible. Through them, we can re–learn how to be delighted with prayer, and in the real, living relationship we have with God. Matthew 6 tells us to be real in our prayers, no posturing or showing off or the like. ‘...go into your room, close the door.’ (Matthew 6:6 NIV) By closing the door you’re putting yourself in the mindset of being closed off from distractions to focus all of your attention on God. It may feel like there are so many other things you should be doing that you can’t afford to close the door, but what better way to deal with those worries than to bring them to God? Try physically closing the door when you pray to shut out distractions, and, for the next week, try writing your prayers down in a notebook and putting them away to be remembered later.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.' John 15:7 NLT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>John 15:7 doesn’t give us licence to treat God like a magic genie. We don’t just tell Him what we want and watch it appear in a puff of smoke. (Even if we did expect that as kids—praying for whatever we wanted, off the top of our heads. Chocolate. A pony. A barrel of spider monkeys wearing tophats.) But there’s a first part to that verse. And it rolls out like this: ‘Abide vitally united to Me…’ (John 15:7 AMP) Our life comes from God. We’re vitally con-nected to Him. And He’s connected to us—it goes on to say: ‘...and [if] My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.’ Get your teeth into your Bible and you’ll naturally be praying that bit more in line with the things that God wants to do anyway. When you’re obedient to Him, your desires will start to look more like His will. James 4:3 NIV says: ‘...when you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives…’ So let’s check our motives; be willing to let God change your desires, too. This might have to be re–learned from old habits of praying selfishly (no more barrels of spider monkeys, sigh.) Once you’re living and moving in–tune with God and His will, ‘...ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.’ Been writing down your prayers like we suggested yesterday? Good. Now, go back through them, and for each one that requests something, think about why you’re asking it: what are your desires, are they in line with God’s will?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Seek His face always...' 1 Chronicles 16:11 NIV<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Ok, in the days before the paparazzi trailed celebs and royals everywhere, it was quite common for the average person to have no idea what a famous person looked like. No magazines, no photographs, no paintings. In the ancient world, even people working in the palace all their lives might never get close enough to know what the king actually looked like. Seeking God’s face always means desiring to have continual access to God’s presence. To be with Him. To feel His reassuring closeness. All the time. But how can we do that continually when life can be so busy? Sometimes finding time in the middle of things is hard. It’s great to take time outside of our busy activity to pray. Sometimes we need that close presence in the ‘always’ ongoing bit of our lives. Psalm 16:11 AMP says that in God’s presence ‘is fullness of joy’. Here’s a fact: when you’re *in* your day, all wrapped up in the minute–by–minute stuff, God is still with you. You are still able to know that. Making God the focus of your day, your life, each second is easier said than done, but in each decision you make and in each word you speak, make that conscious effort to look up to God. It’s worth it. So: for today, here’s a task. On the hour, every hour, say hi to God, and bring one thing from the past hour to Him. Ask Him to be in the next 60 minutes, too. Just quickly make the effort to check in with Him. Set reminders on your phone, if necessary.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...He fell with His face to the ground and prayed...' Matthew 26:39 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>In Matthew 26 we see Jesus in a very human light. He knows what’s about to happen—Judas will betray Him—so He takes His disciples to a garden called Gethsemane. He chose to walk a bit further than they did, to pray alone. You might ask why Jesus separated Himself to pray. There is no straight–cut answer but it’s possible that, by being alone, He had greater room to express His emotions. He tells the closest three disciples: ‘My soul is exceedingly sorrowful…’ (Matthew 26:38 NIV) Sometimes, it’s good to be alone before God and pour your heart out to Him without holding back (maybe more than we already do). Three times Jesus prays, ‘Let this cup be taken from Me,’ (Matthew 26:39 NIV) but He follows it up with: ‘Your will be done.’ (Matthew 26:42 NIV) Three times. When you’re battling your human emotions, it’s a good call to keep going back to God and recommitting yourself to Him. This is a crucial moment in Jesus’ life, and we gain insight into how He poured this out to God. Right. That’s a fairly privileged position. If Jesus (God Himself) let loose and literally cried out to His heavenly Father, despite who He is, what does that teach us? Don’t be afraid to open up the very, very weakest parts of yourself to God. Don’t forget that Jesus knows already; He told His disciples: ‘The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’ (Matthew 26:41 NIV) We can take encouragement in that, because God knows how much we need Him; we don’t need to be perfect to approach Him in prayer. Whatever you’ve been praying about recently, whatever is really on your heart, pray for it three times, at three different points today. SoulFood: Gen 5:22–24, Heb 11:5, 2 Kings 2:1–12</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Cast your bread upon the waters...' Ecclesiastes 11:1 ESV <br /><br /></p>
<p>You didn’t read that wrong, that’s an actual verse in the Bible… What’s it going on about? Should we be feeding more ducks or something? Here’s a basic outline of what’s going on. The same as now, bread back in long, long ago times was used for food; the more bread or grain farmers sent out in trade, the more places it reached, the more they would get back. It’s really simple. Jesus liked to use ‘everyday’ examples to get across the point. Stick with us here: our ‘grain’ can be taken to mean our gifts and talents. Like a labourer trying to get a good return, we can share what we have with others (no matter who they are) to bless them. Why? Well, when we use our gifts in lots of diverse ways and reach out to as many people as we can with them, there’s a principle at work: ‘...after many days you may receive a return’ (that’s the other half of verse 11). Chip away at the things you do, day by day. Watch as God grows you and the situation you’re in. You reap what you sow. (An agricultural way of saying that you get back what you give out.) God wants to use you in the ways He has gifted you, but you need to put yourself out there for that to happen. What has God been calling you in to? If you can feel God nudging you in a particular direction, note it down. Then pray about it to discern if it’s His will for your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...He rescued me because He delighted in me.' Psalm 18:19 ESV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Cast your eye over Psalm 18. Yup, all 50 verses. Might seem a large ask, but consider: you’d spend more minutes in a session scrolling through your social media feed. Think about exactly what sort of image Psalm 18 paints of God. Fairly impressive, right? Let’s take verse 7, for example: ‘The foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because He was angry.’ So, it’s a fair bet to assume that God is great and mighty. And yet, it goes on to say in verse 16: ‘He reached down from on high and took hold of me.’ God, in all His splendour and glory reached down to be with us. To save us and bring us close to Himself. Why would God do something like that? It’s written in black and white in verse 19: ‘He rescued me because He delighted in me.’ Despite all that He is responsible for (founder of the universe, ’n all), God takes pleasure in you. That’s why He chose to reach all the way down to us. That’s why Jesus gave His life for us. 1 John 4:10 NIV says: ‘This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.’ His love means He’ll protect you fiercely when you ask and strengthen you to stand with Him. ‘You make Your saving help my shield’ (Psalm 18:35 NIV), ‘You armed me with strength for battle.’ (Psalm 18:39 NIV) Take time to remember God’s love for you today and let it really sink in.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Daniel resolved not to defile himself...' Daniel 1:8 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The Bible is crammed full of examples of God’s people standing up for things they know to be right. Other people often disagreed with their convictions, and sometimes made life hard for them because of it. The religious authorities weren’t too chuffed about Jesus’ convictions either. Daniel, in his decision ‘not to defile himself with the royal food and wine’ (Daniel 1:8 NIV) was making a stand. Choosing to stand for something we know is right by God can be tough, especially when we know it might not go down so well with those around us. By making his decision, Daniel probably risked his position. But, he stood for what he knew to be the right thing. The great part? ‘God had caused the official to show favour…to Daniel.’ (Daniel 1:9 NIV) Oh, and then: ‘…they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.’ (Daniel 1:15 NIV) Culinary win. God honoured Daniel’s willingness to submit to and glorify Him. God will always be faithful when He tells you to step out in faith. Proverbs 3:5 NIV says: ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.’ Really, though, God always goes ahead of you, even when you can’t see the path. The old 2 Corinthians 5:7 gem still stands as completely true: ‘…we live by faith, not by sight.’ Have you got a prayer buddy? If so, then agree to pray with them for wisdom and encouragement about any stand God’s calling you to make that scares you. If not, then pray to find one so you can pray about that stand together.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Give your servant a discerning heart to... distinguish between right and wrong.' 1 Kings 3:9 NIV</p>
<p>In this verse, Solomon is doing two main things. First, he’s admitting He’s not capable of governing ‘a great people’. He’s saying to God, ‘Ok, Lord, I can’t do this without you. You know best.’ Sometimes even that aspect can be difficult, can’t it? Does pride stand in your way of admitting to God that you’re a bit out of your depth? Proverbs 3:5 NKJ says: ‘…lean not on your own understanding.’ And we’re reminded in Philippians 4:13 NKJ that we can ‘do all things through Christ’. So, when you’re making a decision, firstly you need to recognise that God always knows best. Sounds kinda obvious. But He does. He knows best. Always. The second thing that Solomon does here is ask God for the help he needs. After admitting his inability to do something alone, Solomon asks God to ‘give your servant a discerning heart…’ Ask God for whatever–it–is you need (and to know what you definitely don’t need) to do His will. Asking for discernment to see how God wants you to behave/approach a situation will mean you’re wise in the decisions you make. James 1:5 NIV says, ‘If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God.’ So, turn to God and trust in His provision and wisdom when you’re making decisions today. And tomorrow, too. Why not. Every time you have to make a choice today (we mean every time, starting with your cereal options), pray ‘not my will, but Yours’ beforehand. Just try it. Maybe Jesus doesn’t mind whether you go for cornflakes or muesli, but it’ll build a vital habit.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'They exclaimed: &quot;Everyone is looking for You!&quot;' Mark 1:37 NIV<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Recognise any of these symptoms? You get irritated and edgy with people you normally like. You desperately need sleep yet you can’t stop your mind from keeping you awake. You know you need God but you don’t seem to have the time. Ever. Maybe you’re prioritising the wrong things. You’re saying ‘yes’ out of guilt or obligation, and the knock–on effect is saying ‘no’ to something or somebody important. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus didn’t seem to utter a single guilt–ridden ‘yes’. When word got out Jesus had healed Peter’s mother–in–law, a crowd gathered and He ministered to them late into the night. Early the next morning when He slipped away to a quiet place to pray, the disciples went looking for Him. ‘When they found Him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for You!”’ But note Jesus’ response: ‘Let us go somewhere else.’ (Mark 1:38 NIV) He chose to be Spirit–led, not guilt–driven. It’s not up to you to meet every single need out there. Sometimes, it’s right to say ‘no’. If you have difficulty saying ‘no,’ it’s ok to say, ‘Let me pray about it and get back to you.’ Then pray, listen carefully, and make your decision. God wants us to keep a focus on Him, and occasionally we’ll have to leave some things for others, in order to keep following His plan. For the third day running we are advising you spend time with God (we think it’s a good idea, in case you hadn’t got the message just yet). Why not wrap up warm and take a walk outside in silence, without any headphones? Whatever you do, the important thing is intentionally to make the effort to meet with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Don't cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself.' Romans 12:3 PHPS<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>It can be hard to come by sometimes. You can scroll, flick and click your way through a load of stuff that clogs up your ability to say ‘yes’ to things that are uplifting. Or even world–changing. When we start with God, and get grounded in Him, we have to prepare ourselves to say ‘no’ to what-ever doesn’t match up to Him. Which, in today’s world can be a difficult one. But we’re optimistic. And we like it that way, even when it seems naïve. See, the ‘renewing’ process that we talked about in yesterday’s reading is a process that replaces self–booing thoughts with self–affirming thoughts. Things like being ‘God’s children.’ (Galatians 3:26 NIV) He’s given us the freedom to be free from hypercriticism about ourselves. Here’s a thing: you’re worth dying for. Not because you’ve much worth in yourself but because God loves you. In His eyes, we really, really matter. God wants to use us to make a real difference. The best thing we can do is to head back to June 15 and recall how to ‘take captive’ (2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV) those thoughts that would say otherwise. Which, by the way, shouldn’t end up with us being full of ourselves. No. Knowing who we are in God will mean we’re full of Him; not full of ourselves. We should be ready to point others His way. Ask God to show you how positively He sees you, then make a list of your ten best qualities. (Awkward… but good for you). Keep the list safe as you learn how to use them for Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.' 1 John 3:18 NIV<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Let’s kick today’s reading off with a bit of a disclaimer: actions aren’t a replacement for words. ‘Cheers W4U, I wondered why nobody was responding to my pointed glaring at the coffee machine; turns out I have to use words too?’ Yeah, pretty much. What we’re getting at is this; today’s verse isn’t sug-gesting we shouldn’t speak love, it’s suggesting that our love should also crank out some actual acts, along with speech. Expressing your love for peo-ple through words is still really important. But if all you ever do is say, ‘I love you,’ and that’s the end of it, then your love hasn’t covered the distance from your mouth to your heart. Let alone got further. Ok then, what stuff can we do that will really make a difference in our world? Jesus gives us some pretty good ideas in Matthew 25:35–36. There, He lists a couple of needs (hunger, thirst, visiting the sick and prisoners) and then tells us how to meet them. In true Jesus–style, it’s stuff we already know but often fail to do. He’s pointing out the obvious and prompting us to do it. Now, your calling might not be to visit people in prison, maybe your calling is to be a friend to that person at school/college/uni/work who doesn’t seem to be included very much. Whatever it is, you can be sure that, if God’s prompting you, He’s giving you the opportunity to act like Jesus, to act in love. Not the wordy type? Your acts can speak as true as any words could—if not more. So, while it may seem a bit of a cliché, perhaps it’s time to ask yourself: WWJD? And to start doing whatever Jesus would do.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God faithfully keeps His promises.' 1 Corinthians 1:9 GWT</p>
<p>Think being a Christian is boring? Check out these headlines. Man in desert discovers burning bush that can’t be extinguished. Sea opens and thousands walk through on dry land. Killer giant downed by teen with slingshot. Jewish girl saves her people from destruction. Three young rebels survive blazing furnace. Man brought back from the dead after four days. City walls mysteriously fall. Preacher swallowed by giant fish and lives to tell the tale. Prophet caught up to Heaven in a fiery chariot. These aren’t from the tabloids; they’re from Scripture. Adventure means ‘exciting and dangerous undertakings’. When you embark on the spiritual adventure Paul mentions, you can expect God to test your faith in ways you never imagined. The Bible talks about those ‘who through faith conquered kingdoms… shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength.’ (Hebrews 11:33–34 NIV) Wait, what about when we’re feeling less than adventurous? What about when we just don’t feel like trying to share the Gospel again? Have a read of Hebrews 11, it’s packed full of tales of God’s servants who managed to see past their inadequacies to the promise–filled adventures God had for them. Yes, ‘Adventure is Out There!’— we’ve just got to trust that God is in control and keeps His promises. Have a think of some situations where you’ve waited for the perfect opportunity to share your faith. Ask God to help you to push past your waiting and take steps into the adventure of sharing the Gospel.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'We do not wage war as the world does.' 2 Corinthians 10:3 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>When we feel under attack or threatened, God wants us to call on Him. He doesn’t want us to call our assailant names or switch over to human manipulation. In the surrounding context of today’s verse, Paul is responding to other preachers’ criticism of him: they’ve been saying he’s a dodgy speaker, only brave on paper. Worse, they seem to have been muddying and distorting the Gospel message Paul’s been so painstakingly preaching. Paul’s response? He doesn’t defend himself, or call the competition names, but points to the power of God to fight for His own Gospel, and defend His faithful speakers whilst He’s at it. What if we told you that the weapons we usually use in arguments did more harm than good? That reflex we have on sniping back, or resorting to a personal jibe when someone criticises us, don’t achieve much but wounded souls on both sides (and unfixed problems). So, what about us? Romans 8:9 NIV says we are ‘…not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit…’ God wants us close enough to reach for Him as our default, not for human weaponry. ‘...pray in the Spirit on all occasions.’ (Ephesians 6:18 NIV) If our response under threat is to ask God to sort things out, He’ll move behind the scenes, and He’ll equip you when you’re challenged. Today, when anyone talks to you, send up a silent, instant prayer: ‘JESUS!’ in your head. In that moment, ask Him to be with you in that, and every conversation. See what difference it makes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Not My will, but Yours be done.' Luke 22:42 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>We’ve all been there; you’re waiting on an answer to prayer, longing for God to step into that tricky situation or relationship. It can get difficult. And we don’t mean ‘can’t get past that level on Candy Crush’ difficult. We mean ‘feeling entirely lost, hurt and broken’ difficult. Real, end–of–the–road broken-ness, the kind of difficult that leaves us with huge questions. Surely God can see you’re not having the best time? Why would He let that happen? Isn’t it about time for a bit of a dramatic movie–style solution, like, giant eagles swooping in to whisk you out of your situation or something? Well, the truth is He can see it, and He is working towards the best possible resolution (it may not include eagles, though, sorry). Psalm 56:8 NLT says, ‘You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.’ God knows the pain you’re going through. He knows better than anyone how much it hurts to have the people you love turn away from you, He knows the true meaning of sacrifice and He’s massively aware of what it means to suffer loss. But then, why let us go through it all? He’s not oblivious, but He’s also not going to let our pain be pointless. He uses ordinary, broken people all the time in the Bible; just look at the likes of Paul and Peter. So, how’s He going to use your brokenness? We don’t know. Maybe you should ask Him…</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I want my share...now...' Luke 15:12 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ever eaten your cake before your birthday or sneakily opened a Christmas present the day before? Well, how about having a funeral for someone be-fore they’ve died...? In Jesus’ story of the ‘Prodigal Son’, the antihero of the story asked for his dad’s inheritance while his dad was still fully alive and functional. The inheritance was the father’s identity. So, we’re not talking about a bit of cheek here. We’re actually not even talking about something that was downright rude. By saying, ‘I want my share now,’ the son was making a move on his father’s identity, and really saying, ‘I’m prepared to act as if you’re dead.’ The Prodigal Son’s story starts as the son wipes the father from his mind and heart. The world around us has declared God is dead quite a few times and held more than a few ‘funerals’ for Him. Declaring that we don’t need His morality, that science has removed a need for Him as a reason for the universe, that frankly, ‘He was getting in the way’ of our fun… And here’s the kicker, Christian: we reckon you have too. In fact, in every sin—in every moment of ‘just this once…’—we effectively say to Him: ‘I’m prepared to act as if you’re dead.’ Heavy message today? If Christianity is a relationship with Jesus, then sin is more hurtful than rule–breaking. Have some one–to–one time in that relationship today, a Jesus–coffee–catch-up, a walk, whatever, and talk with Him about those moments you acted as if He wasn’t there. Can you decide to put turning your whole life to Him above them?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...he wasted everything he had...' Luke 15:13 GWT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Of course the father accepted him back. Really the Prodigal Son story is about Him (the character of God we see through the character of the father) and His forgiveness, even when we treat Him like dirt. It’s a story that continues to be played out today by us all. We try to go it alone for whatever reason and reap the consequence. And God accepts us back. You’d think He’d get tired, but this story is one He’s still happy to write in each of our lives. And then, as Christians, we play it out again. We might be saved, but in our still–sinfilled life, the story of the prodigal son haunts us, echoes through our decisions. We damage others. We still get tangled up in hurtful situations and wound others. We waste friendships, we waste the wealth of our new lives in Christ. You might feel like you’ve put wasted hours into friendships, relationships… even into Church... only to see them burned up, even by your own decisions. But. He. Doesn’t. Waste. Anything. Even though the loss is real, God can make beauty from ashes. He makes good use of all that happens. Not only will He welcome you back, hold you in your self–inflicted hurt, but He will also turn the situation around for good. Are there times that have ended in calamity, or times you’ve left others in pain? These things are hard and people aren’t always around to say sorry. Ask God for the calm and stillness that will help you to trust in Him, and to trust that He will make all things turn out for good (Philippians 4:7 and Isaiah 26:3 style).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He made us accepted in the Beloved.' Ephesians 1:6 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ever sent a friend request on Facebook and regretted it for fear that they’ll hit ignore? ‘It’ll be awkward next time they see me, so they’ll have to accept, right?’ Acceptance can be a tough one. Much of our world today is more about how popular we are and less about who we are. The social media world often measures our worth based on how many Twitter followers we have, how many times our cat meme gets reblogged, or how many likes on our ‘Thanks for the bazillion birthday wishes’ Facebook post. Seeing as Jesus wants you as you are now, not just who you might become some day, you’d think we might want to draw our self–esteem from there. He actually lived out the ‘you’re worth dying for’ concept. Ephesians 1:6 NKJ says, ‘He made us accepted in the Beloved.’ Amazing, so we’re good, yeah? Not quite. God loves us enough to accept us, just as we are. But He loves us too much to leave us just as we are. Titus 2:11–12 NIV says God’s grace ‘teaches us to say “no” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self–controlled, upright and godly lives.’ We can’t ‘earn’ God’s love, but we can let that love impact the way we do life. We can use that amazing acceptance as a motivation, a life–long well of joy that helps us make God–filled choices. So: text Ephesians 1:6 to a Christian friend today. It might be just what they need to hear.</p>

<p>In Elizabethan England, the hot trend in cosmetics was to mix white lead and vinegar together and apply to your face. The problem with this was that it led to lead poisoning. Hygiene wasn’t a big priority either—Queen Elizabeth I reportedly said she had a bath once a month, whether she needed it or not. We’ve luckily moved a long way in cosmetics and sanitation since the 16th century. Every cosmetics brand has its own science lab, and hopefully none of them will be slipping deadly chemicals into your bath or shower gel. Yet despite the sheer volume of stuff out there that promises to make us look good, we all tend to be more insecure than we’d actually like to admit. It’s heart–breaking. Especially when our value just doesn’t change because of what’s on the outside. There’s nothing wrong in (healthily) trying to look good, but not as the be–all and end–all for our self–worth. ‘...because of Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us from the beginning, and all things happen just as He decided long ago.’ (Ephesians 1:11 NLT) Jesus loves you, and if you’re a Christian then today’s scripture should remind you of His purpose for you—something He destined you to become before you were even born. That’s really important. And, if you ask, He’ll slowly start to help you see it. When you learn to see yourself as God sees you, confidence soars and purpose roars. It’s what God says that makes the difference. So—if you’re someone who really struggles with how you see yourself, talk to someone. Seriously. Today. Get some support from a trusted member of your church, or family.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He will lift you up.' James 4:10 NKJ<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Rodney Smith was born in a tent, raised in a travelling community, and never attended a school—not even for one day. Yet, despite the fact his begin-nings weren’t stable or glamorous, God used him to influence the lives of millions around the globe. In 1876, General William Booth (the founder of the Salvation Army) saw potential in this humble man and put him to work as an evangelist. By the time of his death in 1947, he had preached in the United States and Britain for over seventy years. He once said, ‘I didn’t go through your colleges and seminaries. They wouldn’t have me… but I have been to the feet of Jesus where the only true scholarship is learned.’ God loves to lift the humble, the hidden, the obscure: David went from shepherd boy to king; Joseph went from prisoner to prime minister; Abraham went from childless to father of nations. You may feel like a ‘nobody’ right now, but God sees a ‘somebody.’ When the voice within whispers, ‘Who are you? What can you do? You’ll never amount to anything,’ that’s not God. It’s the deceiver, trying to throw you off course. That’s why it’s so important to spend time in prayer, renewing yourself in what God says about you. Mull over these words tonight, before you go to sleep: ‘So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time He will lift you up in honour. Give all your worries and cares to God, for He cares about you.’ (1 Peter 5:6–7 NLT)&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'All things are possible to him who believes.' Mark 9:23 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ever been here? You need to make an urgent call but—gah!—you’ve bled your battery dry checking Facebook / listening to music / watching animals make ridiculous noises on YouTube. We can get caught by a similar pothole with our minds, actually. Maybe we prioritise Netflix or gaming to a point where we’ve stayed up late, and ‘don’t have time’ to read the Bible. You were designed to check in with God first—everything else is mere add–ons. While day–to–day stuff on your phone may be a proper part of life, it’s really just a secondary bolt–on to the soul–stuff we get from God. It’s a risky business running your phone on 10% charge, hoping your battery doesn’t die before you make it home. But it’s far riskier running your spirit on 10%—time with God re–awakens our lives, enabling us to inhabit the fullness He promises. When we run on low we’re susceptible to damage. Our thoughts can darken, temptation can brighten. We may turn in on ourselves or on others, nit–picking and fault–finding. Tiredness has a way of bringing out the worst in us, whether it’s physical tiredness or spiritual tiredness. When you feel so drained you can’t lift yourself up, tap into prayer–power; let God lift you up. Repair, restoration and re–commissioning all happen in the quiet place. Instead of seeing prayer as an obligation, see it as a vital power–up. Choose a time to turn your phone off and charge it. While it’s charging, spend time in prayer and worship.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you.' Romans 15:7 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The sum of Jesus’ teachings adds up to this: love God, love others. Everything else is a working out of that. Loving God is hard enough—we pick up all kinds of mess and shame along the way, which can warp our picture of Him, if we leave it unattended. But loving others, with their bad attitudes and selfishness and inconsistencies—oh puh–lease! How can you love someone who stabs you in the back and doesn’t seem to think they’ve done anything wrong? How can you like someone who believes stuff you know is wrong? How can you love someone who won’t forgive you but expects you to forgive them? How can you accept someone who lives like they do? We’re all sinners. So maybe the question should be turned around: ‘How can they love someone who lives like you do?’ We are all fallen. We all fail. Our struggles may be different to others, but none of us is perfect. Only Jesus lived a life without sin—and yet He accepts you, despite yours (yes, even your worst and most recent sins). Isn’t the best response to accept others, despite theirs? Jesus said, ‘I give you... freely, so help other people freely.’ (Matthew 10:8 NCV) Live generously with your material stuff, yes, and live generously in spirit with one another. You know that person who you wouldn’t spit on, even if they were on fire? (Be honest.) Ask God to show you how God sees them. Ask God to help you love and accept them. Then, do one encouraging thing for them in the next week.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Lord will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right.' Psalm 84:11 NLT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Soooo… here we are halfway through 2015. Time to take stock. Feel as though you’ve taken some good steps forward so far? Maybe some of it’s been hard. Know what? Every day is perfect for a fresh start. ‘...His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.’ (Lamentations 3:22–23 NIV) Messed up? God knows. His arms are still wide open. Been hurt? God heals. Every morning He’s waiting with new refreshment, new strength for the day, new compassion. Yet it’s frustrating when you feel like you’ve done your bit, and... nothing. You’ve sent up prayers but nothing’s changed. Still you can be sure of this: God has heard every prayer. Psalm 56:8 NLT goes as far to say, ‘You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.’ God feels your pain. He meets you in your pain. But He knows why sometimes He gives a ‘yes’, sometimes a ‘wait’, and other times a ‘no’. ‘The Lord will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right.’ (Psalm 84:11 NLT) God hasn’t overlooked you or preferred someone else. ‘And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) Leave the hurts of the first half of the year to past history. And now look forward to the rest of 2015.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Let him...boast...that he understands and knows Me.' Jeremiah 9:24 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Know what God wants most from you? Not a tally of names you’ve helped convert. Not a list of good deeds you’ve ticked off. Not an in–depth knowl-edge of the Old Testament minor prophets. Nor does He want your songs most, nor your church attendance, nor your good intentions. All of those things are great, but most of all, He wants your friendship. God wants the deepest part of you; the part that defines you: your heart. When everyone is busy doing something for Him, few want to know Him. They’ll talk about Him, write about Him, sing about Him; and yet ignore Him. He wants more than to just be an item on your to–do list or a Sunday obligation or guilty ‘must–pray–more’ feeling in your conscience; He wants you. ‘…pray without ceasing’ (1 Thessalonians 5:17 ESV) means an ongoing dialogue. Friends don’t chat out of obligation; they want to share life together. God wants to share your life; to be right in the centre of involvement, and to share Himself with you: ‘The Lord confides in those who fear Him; He makes His covenant known to them.’ (Psalm 25:14 NIV) Will you get to know Him better by the end of this year? What can you do to help yourself speak and listen to God? Will a journal help? A regular prayer time? A Bible commentary? Make a commitment today, to something of that sort, and write your commitment on paper to remind you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God and... the word of His grace... can build you up and give you an inheritance.' Acts 20:32 NIV <br /><br /></p>
<p>Right. Story time: ‘There are these two young fish swimming along and they meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And one young fish looks over at the other and goes: “What in the seven seas is water?”’ A similar story was told in a graduation speech by a guy called DF Wallace, who then went on to make his point: that the normal, the everyday, the cli-ché bits of our lives (even clichéd story about fish) can have colossal value that we skip over because we know them so well. Sometimes we have to defend the value of the totally obvious to ourselves. How much more so with God’s grace—the everyday truth of our lives that we can’t always see? God’s grace simply means God giving us more of Him-self than we have any right to. For our day’s work. For the work of talking to other people about Jesus. For our hearts and their emotional well–being. For the people around us. For our healing. For their healing. God will always give us more of Himself than we hope or deserve. He wants to ‘build you up and give you an inheritance.’ We forget this. The worship songs get over–learned and the sermons get stale unless we remind ourselves, even daily. You are not just a spring of God’s grace that pops up in a desert—you’re part of God’s great river of grace, rushing through history, carrying every believer. He’s our water. And He wants to flow through us.</p>

<p>Alrighty, then. Inheritance, me hearties. Rolling in gold dubloons as diamonds tinkle down the marble steps of our multi–floored mansions. Sorry! Let that idea be marooned on a desert island while we look at what Jesus had to say about our inheritance. ‘In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to Myself, that where I am you may be also.’ (John 14:1–3 ESV) In Jesus’ time, guests would be ‘received’ in a room by their host. But if there were too many guests, and not enough rooms, the guests would be turned away and the host would never get around to welcoming them. Jesus’ words in the verses above are a great comfort—they are often spoken at funerals and deathbeds, and not without reason. They’re our inheri-tance as Christians. Simply: ‘where I (God) am, you will be.’ You won’t be turned away and He won’t have too little time to get round to you. It should build you up today, too. God’s warm welcome is part of the everyday that you can’t always see. This is the gift passed down to you from our Father—you are never alone, never abandoned even in a seeming absence. Your hospitality is part of how other people see God’s welcome. Welcome someone into your home and make them a meal—preferably someone you don’t know greatly (but trust to invite over!) If you don’t live by yourself, spend some time planning how you might make it happen.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He couldn't do any miracles among them...And He was amazed at their unbelief.' Mark 6:5-6 NLT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Sometimes, God does what’s best for us, despite our lack of faith (and praise Him for intervening, regardless!) But, most times He also wants to involve us. He wants to work in and through us to bring His kingdom to earth. Great stuff and a MASSIVE privilege. Except for the flipside… This means there are times when He seems to answer prayer in a manner directly related to our level of faith. Our almighty God, our universe–creating King–of–Heaven sometimes limits Himself, deliberately. When we’re living out of little faith, or even unbelief, God may re-strict Himself from doing everything He could do. Jesus has no trouble healing crowds, multiplying packed lunches, and raising the dead in front of masses who were open to letting Him do His thing. Yet to a group who knew Him from when He was growing up—‘Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon?’—who ‘took offence at Him’ (Mark 6:3 NIV), Jesus ‘could not do any miracles there, except lay His hands on a few sick people and heal them.’ (Mark 6:5 NIV) What? Jesus couldn’t do something? Huh? Doesn’t sound like the Jesus we know, does it? But it shows the importance of the part God wants us to play—being open to Him, to working with Him to bring healing, and bring His Kingdom. It matters to God that we’re part of His Kingdom–bringing plan. Today, make a hole in your plans to read Mark 1–6 in your Bible. As you read, challenge yourself: am I open to God moving like this in my life?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You will forget your trouble...as water gone by.' Job 11:16 NCV<br /><br /></p>
<p>These are the times God works on our character and faith. There’s nothing like a long wait to work on our patience. Or overwhelming odds to stretch our faith. Even when it feels never–ending, ‘You will forget your misery; it will be like water flowing away.’ (Job 11:16 ESV) Forgetting doesn’t mean losing a block of memory. It means reaching the point where the memory is free of pain, just as poison is pulled from a snake bite. As healing begins, the mind’s continual replay of the event reduces and the memory becomes like ‘water gone by’. And so the King James Version has a phrase, often used, which is loaded with meaning: ‘And it came to pass.’ It speaks of a profound truth: life doesn’t stand still. There will always be challenges, but no matter how bad things look, the phrase is, ‘It came to pass’, not ‘It came to stay’. There will be times when your life feels like a rollercoaster car reeling off the tracks. But there’s good news: we can submit our troubles under God’s authority, and they will pass. Kristin Armstrong says: ‘When someone died in Old Testament times, those...in mourning marked their faces with ashes. They allotted a specified sea-son, after which they scrubbed up and moved on... [But] we’re so busy hiding, we’re buried under ashes on the inside. God will call us to arise and shine when our light has come (Isaiah 60:1). Ask Him to set your time limit, and be ready to wash your face.’ Then, whatever your grief is—over the death of a person or a relationship—move on.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God...told His people...&quot;Let the weary rest.&quot;' Isaiah 28:12 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>It’s not like Elijah’s prayer life has died, nor has he committed some terrible sin. Far from it—he’s been on the frontline of God’s purpose. His faith is bold and exemplary. It’s just that he’s tired. Exhausted, in fact. He’s been running from one spiritual battle to another and now his body is fatigued. His mind is drained, his spirit worn out. When you’ve been running on adrenalin your body and mind eventually have to play ‘catch up’. For Elijah, there’s no exclusive spa to recuperate in. And so, after defeating hundreds of prophets of the bloodthirsty god Baal, he runs away, crawls under a tree in the hot sun and asks to die. (1 Kings 19:4) A bit dramatic? When we’re bone weary, our minds can lose perspective completely. At times like this, we need to stop. Completely. Elijah crawls to a quiet place and bares his soul. In the quiet place he finds God. And you can too. ‘Jesus said... “Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. ...I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls... My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”’ (Matthew 11:25–30 NIV) What’s all that about, then? If you’re feeling burned out, your ability to appreciate life and make the most of opportunities will seem to fade. Does that resonate? Come to God before you get worn down completely. Take yourself to a quiet place and read about Elijah’s fatigue in 1 Kings 19. Follow it up with a time of soul–baring prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Be still, and know that I am God.' Psalm 46:10 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Athletes train to excel—pushing the limits of what their bodies can usually handle. Yet one twinge of a hamstring and they’re on red alert. Not stopping to heal means that they’ll face greater damage down the line. Psalm 46:10 is our warning for spiritual hamstring tweaks: ‘Be still, and know that I am God.’ The temptation is to do more or do it faster; this is the ‘distraction’ deceit—it keeps us going for the time being, but somewhere down the track we are going to pull up in pain. Jesus never said, ‘Keep going, it’s like a stitch, eventually you’ll run it off.’ No, He said, ‘Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.’ (Matthew 11:28 NLT) If you think you can take it into your own hands and recharge yourself, think again. ‘Jesus said, “I am the Vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in Me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.”’ (John 15:5 NLT) If we want to do anything well, we need to prioritise time with the Father, Son and Spirit. Why? It’ll not only help you to be more effective as a well–rested worker, but also help you to step outside of the thick of life to get a better perspective and appreciate all you have. Matthew 6:33 NIV says: ‘...seek first His Kingdom.’ When you ‘come near to God…He will come near to you.’ (James 4:8 NIV) Fit in a rest period today to recoup your strength. Even if it’s just five minutes. Say: ‘God, I am seeking You and Your Kingdom first,’ then sit for a while in quiet and stillness.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Above all else, guard your heart.' Proverbs 4:23 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Let’s hit the ground running from yesterday’s reading: some thoughts are easier to keep out than others. We all need help in different areas. But here’s something we can all agree on: doubt can feel like a killer, right? Just as we’re starting to keep our minds close to God, we feel the carpet sliding out from under our feet. Did. You. Know. That God’s hold on us isn’t loosened every time we have a back–and–forth with ourselves over His love for us? Or even His existence. Clearly it’s good to have a sense of security but, during those times/nights/philosophy lessons where we’re not so sure, He’s right there. How does this link to today’s verse? Like this: God can and does guard us even when we don’t feel safe ourselves. Best way to deplete the enemy’s chance of shoulder–barging us off course? Don’t rely on yourself to keep your faith; being saved by faith is a ‘gift of God.’ (Ephesians 2:8 NIV) When we’re going through times of doubt, it’s probably best not to wholly rely on ourselves (or even other well–meaning folk) reassuring us that God is with us. Simply ask God for faith in Him. And, just as brilliantly, God has ‘bought at a price’ (1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJ) the rights to every part of us: including our minds. Present it back to Him, and He’ll take the lead. Be honest with God—what do you struggle to believe? Pray about it, ask Him to settle your mind, then find a wiser–older Christian to discuss those things with at some point this week.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'For we are God's handiwork.' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Recap: your mind matters. In case you hadn’t picked up on it by now, it’s a serious business, this whole does–God–have–the–keys–to–my–mind chat. And, truth be told, we need to be aware there’s a spiritual war going on around (and within) us. Sometimes, it can feel like we’re torn in two directions: to stay faithful to God’s thoughts on us, or to leave room for doubts. Know what we mean? We’ve all been there at some points, whether it’s gos-sip/lust/anger/whatever. To add to the list, there’s an especially damaging item: self–negativity. Making mistakes can result in pointing a steady blame–finger at ourselves. And in lots of cases, it stays there. Most of us have experienced it in some way; if you’ve been on the receiving end of your internal blame–voice, rational or not, it’s not a good idea. Why? Jesus is all about peace. We have to let God clear the path for us to know we’ve been forgiven. Jesus is keen for us to know peace, and not ‘as the world gives.’ (John 14:27 NIV) How do we let that forgiven–and–free peace in (especially when we’ve settled into a negative pattern of thought toward ourselves)? It’s a process of turning back. Most likely not an overnight one, but a process that takes long enough to learn how God sees us as ‘handiwork’, completely covered by Him. The ‘renewing of your mind’ (Romans 12:2 NIV) is a process that only God can work in us. Have a time of prayer right now, asking God not only to renew your internal voice but to settle only the peace Christ can bring in you.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Hard work brings a profit.' Proverbs 14:23 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Some of the Proverbs seem like they state the obvious. To paraphrase a few: laziness is bad, wisdom is good, lust isn’t a great idea. Today’s verse seems to be no exception: working hard does have its rewards. But are we missing something if we gloss over it? First off, why are we encouraged to work? Didn’t God’s original plan include us idling about in Eden all day, before the Fall happened? Genesis 2:15 tells us that God put Adam to work pretty much straight away, taking care of the whole Garden—hardly a minor responsibility. But then we jump back even further and we see that God Himself sets the pace for a hard–working attitude in the first chapter of the Bible: six days of work, one day of rest. If we’re made in His image, it follows that we’re also designed with a strong work ethic in mind. So what’s our work for? And why should we care about a profit? Colossians 3:23 says, ‘Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people.’ Why? Because, the next verse says, your reward will come from Him. The profit might not look like a whopping annual bonus or a holiday home on a Barrier Reef island. More than likely it’ll last a little longer, satisfy a lot deeper, and benefit not only you but those around you. What task today are you not looking forward to? (Either because it’s hard, or boring… both can be daunting). Decide that you’ll ‘Pray Continually’ through it today, that God would give you new vision and passion to work for Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I have finished the work You gave Me.' John 17:4 GNT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ever feel like your life is a constant attempt to suppress a growing to–do list? No specific task, but a hazy mixture of work/study/church/you–name–it commitments swim around your head (especially when you’re trying to sleep?) Without wanting to sound too much like a self–help thing: sometimes, less is more. Yup. Jesus sets the best example of this: ‘He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.’ (John 6:15 NKJ) Hmmm: ‘Again’. Flicking through the Gospels, it becomes apparent that Jesus is busier than any of us. But ‘again’, He’s trekking back up the mountainside to simply hit pause. Why, then? Well, rather than panicking about the sheer number of people desperate for His attention, Jesus left every detail of His life open to His Father’s will. He left the book of His life open for His Father to write. In John 17, Jesus was coming toward the end of His time with the disciples. He says this: ‘I have brought You glory on earth by finishing the work You gave Me to do.’ (John 17:4 NIV) That’s all that matters. When we feel like there are a thousand different voices pulling us in different directions, we need to take a leaf out of Jesus’ book and make sure God’s voice is the loudest. To keep a focus on what really matters, some voices/responsibilities might need to quieten down. And others will need to go. Jot down all of your responsibilities, whether they’re weekly/monthly/daily. Bring them to God in prayer. What might He want you to get stuck into more, and which ones might need to step aside?&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I must be about My Father's business.' Luke 2:49 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>It’s really, really easy to slip into claiming the fame/honour/glory that’s meant for God for ourselves. It’s not always a conscious effort. In fact, the most dangerous can be the little thoughts that find their way into our actions: ‘Saying these wise words will make me seem like more mature than you’ or ‘Giving this time will make me look like a good Christian in (insert boss or friend’s name) eyes’… Instead of showing God off, we’re throwing fertiliser on our own pride. So, what to do? As Christians, Jesus has paid the price for our freedom, so we’re His. In Galatians 2:20 NIV, Paul goes as far to say that ‘I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.’ As God’s representatives (or ‘ambassadors’, 2 Corinthians 5:20) on earth, that’s far more motivation to reflect praise back at Him (or, where applicable, avoid creating situations that weren’t meant for His praise.)</p>
<p>Let’s make sure people are getting a glimpse of God in us, not just… us. Jesus had this nailed down from an early age. At twelve years old, He said, ‘I must be about My Father’s business.’ (Luke 2:49 KJV) Sounds fairly posh, but essentially He didn’t come to this world to do anything but make God known. And likewise, our work, play, study, you–name–it, is all His. Even our ‘work’–times can be used for God. No excuses. Wherever you are, what can you make a habit of doing that will help others see God in you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'All of you together are the temple.' 1 Corinthians 3:16 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Back in the vintage days, the Romans had some sweet battle tactics. Each soldier’s shield had a hook to attach it to the next guy’s. You move, they move. Like it or not, everyone fought with, and for, their entire line. Church? That’s a similar deal. Paul made a point of getting us to share our lives with our ‘fellow workers’ (Romans 16:3 NKJ). Why should we look out for people that we might have only met in the Sunday coffee area once or twice, then? Look back to today’s verse. The Church, is where God dwells. We reckon engaging with a couple of things will strengthen our relationships with/ increase our engagement with the Church. Tell people what things you like about them. Simple stuff. God–honouring things. Just tell them.</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:11 ESV says ‘Therefore encourage one another and build one another up…’ We think it’s worth doing. Asking God to bless people. Ever had a spontaneous prayer session? The ones where you’re so keen to see God–breathed change that you didn’t need an organised meeting or conference to seek God together? Brilliant. Now do it again. And, here’s some extra news: God is always ‘near to all who call on Him.’ (Psalm 145:18 ESV) He listens. Do you struggle to think of a way to un–awkwardly approach all of those people and have a simple interaction? Pick one positive thing out about someone you know. Go tell ’em.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.' 2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Your mind’s a pretty big door into your life. How you think about God/parents/friends/anyone, and what you do about them, is rooted in what you let in and out of your mind. What else? Well, it’s a conscious battle to keep ourselves in check; to let God always have the first and last words (and everything in between) in our internal conversations. Paul writes this: ‘take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.’ (2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV)</p>
<p>So… this means that when you’re tempted by negativity, it’s not wise to let it run its course (back–chat a little, or let that not–quite–appropriate lustful thought stick about) and then put it behind you before it affects your Christian life. You might think, ‘What’s the harm?’ Well, actually, the harm is all over it. In Matthew 5:27–30, Jesus explains that even teeny–tiny lustful thoughts are no different to adultery. Just before that in Matthew 5:21–26, He mentions that hating someone is effectively murder.</p>
<p>Leaving small thoughts free to linger is dangerous because of where they are heading... far away from God. Soooo. Stop thinking altogether? …Not that either. When you’re spending time with God, you’ll get to know what He does and doesn’t enjoy. And so, when we find ourselves slipping into thoughts that don’t match His will, we have to ask ‘is this what God wants for me?’ By doing that, we’re taking it captive. Thoughts might find their way in, but when they’re met with Jesus, they have to bow to Him.</p>
<p>Today, bow every time you catch yourself thinking something Jesus wouldn’t and hand the thought to Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'They will be won over by observing your...lives.' 1 Peter 3:1-2 NLT <br /><br /></p>
<p>Not without controversy. Is it ok to get into a relationship with someone who doesn’t know Jesus? The Bible’s a good place to start, but unfortunately, different people read the relevant verses differently. ‘A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be mar-ried to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.’ (1 Corinthians 7:39 ESV) Does the new husband have to be a Christian? Or does ‘in the Lord’ mean that the marriage itself is to be a God–honouring one? But: how can you possibly honour God with a marriage that doesn’t put Him at the centre of it? Other verses, about being ‘unequally yoked together’ (2 Corinthians 6:14 KJV) are also brought up to help work it out... but also questioned. Confusing. Practically speaking, it’s not easy. An old preacher put it bluntly: ‘Any time a child of God marries a child of the devil, they’re going to have trouble with their father–in–law.’ Any relationship without the foundation of both people trusting in God will run into tension whenever ‘trusting God for money/the future/guidance’ comes up. But that in itself doesn’t mean that God forbids them. It probably comes down to a question: ‘Is this relationship leading me towards God, and His things (going to church, reading your Bible, prayer)?’ Relationship review. Are your relationships leading you towards, or away from God? Sidenote time: If you’re already married to someone who doesn’t share your beliefs, this is NOT a call to divorce (see 1 Corinthians 7:12–14). If however your relationships are leading you away from God, what can you change today, to sort that out?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Many waters cannot quench love.' Song of Solomon 8:7 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>A tricky part of any romantic relationship (and some awkward friendships...) is the confusion between love and desire. Love is the act of will to make space for the other person, to give out, to help. Desire is the wish to consume, to take in, to look out for the next meal. Sure, they can overlap—it’s fine, for example, to want a marriageable partner for yourself if you’re unmarried—but they often feel like a pull in opposite directions. It’s hard because desire can come as a rush of feeling. But without love, desire turns into sheer animal want—it increases while the pleasure it seeks out decreases. And as it grows, so CS Lewis said in The Screwtape Letters, ‘the sooner it must eat up all the innocent sources of pleasure and pass on to those God forbids.’ Love—that willpower to be responsive to each other’s needs, to put aside our own selfishness in order to serve the other, that quick forgiveness and slow remembrance of wrongs—sets things straight. It gives desire the right scaffolding to hang from: seeking the other person’s best before your own. When it’s the backbone, nothing can break that relationship. It outlives desire, carrying on wanting and working for the other person’s best when romantic love passes. (And, y’know, other loves too—friendships live and die on these same principles.) Ok, so this might be a touch English Lit, but Shakespeare’s sonnet number 116 expresses today’s ideas well. Reflect on this: ‘Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.’ Which is just a different way of saying what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13:6–8 NIV, ‘Love... always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.’&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Nor are your ways My ways.' Isaiah 55:8 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>‘The Lord works in mysterious ways’ is not just a cop–out used when Christians are confronted with difficult questions. Sure it has been used like that when people don’t know what else to say, but there’s still truth in it. We don’t have all the answers or know God’s thoughts. Moses didn’t either. He was told by God he’d lead the Israelites out of slavery. Great; he’d be a hero then. He’d be God’s mouthpiece and convince Pharaoh to free the slaves and life would be grand. Is this what happens? Nope. He speaks to Pharaoh and lands the Israelites in worse trouble. But then he frees them… and, well, the Red Sea episode was definitely not how he expected his prayers to be answered. God doesn’t give up on His plans for us when they seem to hit a roadblock. Most of the time you’ll find His plans aren’t off track. Our expectations are. Sometimes we think our lives are so mundane or so off–course that it can’t be what God had planned. Feel like that? You’re not the only one. Seriously, scan the Bible, there are loads of people who’ve felt it. But God doesn’t miss things. When Joseph was sold and imprisoned and his life seemed out of control, God was at work. When Daniel was taken as a captive to Babylon and his life seemed out of control, God was at work. When Mary was told she’d have a baby who would be born to save the world and her life seemed out of control, God was at work. So we’d say trust Him, whether that’s through boredom, or even through pain.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Go in the strength you have...Am I not sending you?' Judges 6:14 NIV <br /><br /></p>
<p>Gideon is the ultimate reluctant hero; timid, indecisive, full of doubts. Whereas the modern Hollywood action hero shoots first and then thinks later, Gideon puts out a woollen fleece and goes to sleep. Getting the exact answer he asked God for (dew on the fleece with dry ground around about it), he hesitates and asks for the reverse. (Judges 6:36–40) Although Gideon was plagued with self–doubt and hesitancy, his story is one of a massive win. Gideon teaches us that God’s idea of wimps and warriors is anti–Hollywood. Unlike the movie action hero, Gideon had no previous secret service training. He had no training at all, in fact. He wasn’t a seasoned fighter—the only thing he had going for him was God. And what more do you need? Don’t let the odds scare you. Don’t even let reason and logic shout you down. Don’t be intimidated by the size of the job—you have God. ‘With God’s power working in us, God can do much, much more than anything we can ask or imagine.’ (Ephesians 3:20 NCV) Only one opinion matters—God’s. And He told Gideon, ‘Go in the strength you have and save Israel…Am I not sending you?’ (Judges 6:14 NIV) The strength of the Sender, not the weaknesses of the sent, is what saves the day. Read more about the adventures of Gideon in the book of Judges. See what tips you can pick up from how Gideon learned to deal with his uncertainties.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Where your treasure is... there your heart will be also.' Matthew 6:21 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>What would Jesus think about the absolute retail madness that ensues leading up to Christmas and at the Boxing Day sales or as the end of the financial year approaches? Well, there’s nothing in the Gospels about maxing your credit card on ‘buy 1, get 1 free’ department store deals, but there’s plenty in there on the state of our hearts. Luke 18 tells the tale of Jesus and the rich young ruler. This guy has the lot—but the lot isn’t enough. And so he asks Jesus for the secret of eternal life. Jesus tells him: ‘Sell all you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in Heaven; then come and follow Me.’ (Luke 18:22 GNT) This story reminds us that wealth, power, reputation, and even human desire cannot bring us spiritual salvation (Luke 18:27), it’s only possible by God’s free gift of grace through Christ. Jesus does care about our needs, but he’s primarily interested in the condition of our hearts. So, we need to assess those hearts. Would we give Him all? Would we be prepared to sell everything? Will we give Him our ambitions? Instead of fo-cussing our tunnel–vision on building a career, will we seek to (without glory, without salary) to build His Kingdom? Will we give Him all of our lives, not just our Sunday mornings? Jesus said, ‘Where your treasure is…there your heart will be also.’ Your ‘treasure’ can be material stuff, relationships, a career, an identity, or even comfort. Where’s Jesus in your list of priorities? Re–shuffle this list in order of priority: career, relationship, free–time, church, education, money, recognition, friends, prayer time, food, hobbies, holiday, Bible reading, family, ambition, Jesus. Be honest: what needs to change?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ.' Philippians 3:8 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Paul was the super–rigorous, righteously religious poster–boy of the Jewish world. He ticked all of the traditional holiness achievements, and had an impeccable Jewish family bloodline to boot. Then he met Jesus. And he realised that his achievements, his acclaim, his heritage all meant diddly squat compared to the worth that Jesus gave to Him for free. It’s the same for you. None of your world–approved achievements, your church–elder father and grandfather, or your killer Bible knowledge, count to-wards any of your worth once you have God. And, on the beautifully providential flipside, none of your failures, your actually–not–so–together family, or the fact that you don’t know where the book of Zephaniah is, mean that you’re worth any less. Because you have been given the gift of Jesus, you share in His worth, His beauty, and His power. You are precious, and are now able to be made righteous, simply by believing in Christ alone. And that’s flipping huge. Attitude–flipping, perspective–flipping, behaviour–flipping huge! Whatever the world (and even, sometimes, the Church) would consider a massive achievement, or a massive failure, doesn’t make any difference to your God–given ability or value. The only One who does that is Jesus. And, regardless of your worldly situation, He makes you capable of shaking the globe, of changing lives, and of being a part of love–filled revolutions in His name. So go get ’em. Change the world. We’re serious. Believe what you’ve just read above, and live it out. Start today by taking one step, no matter how small, towards changing something that hurts your heart about this world. Trust the power, and responsibility, that Jesus has given to you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Unless the Lord builds the house...' Psalm 127:1 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t. Maybe the idea fills you with joy and sepia–filter dreams of dresses and confetti, maybe it fills you with deep un-ease at sharing everything (and everything you are) with another person, for the rest of your life. Maybe you’ve no idea what we’re on about, and would rather go and run around outside. But most of us have experienced glancing over at someone attractive and wanting to spend a bit of ‘quality time’ with them… So what about this ‘Marriage’ thing then? Shall we have a chat? Get comfy. The first and, by now pretty obvious, bit of wisdom we have for you is the same as we have for every other thing in life: start with Jesus. Put God in charge of your relationships, even (especially) if that’s marriage or marriage–plans, and you won’t go far wrong. (Keeping Him there can be hard work, but is essential). With closeness to God, grace, peace, and selfless love begin to adorn our lives. The Bible’s got some real smarts on how to love and live for other people, which are pretty useful for this whole relating business, whether that’s in looking for/maintaining relationships with life–partners, friends or, well, anyone (y’know, those billions of neighbours Jesus reckons we’ve got). We’ll be looking at some of these over the next few days, and getting wise to some of the threats and solutions might make for stronger love–lives all round. Love–ly.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The wise have wealth and luxury...' Proverbs 21:20 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Any emotional baggage we’re carrying about friendships and relationships gets more intense as we get closer to someone. Wherever you’re at, with mates or marriages, there’s wisdom here we reckon applies to you. Money strains relationships. Whether it was your best friend at kindy or your bestie now, things can be going great until one of you points at a pile of sweet stuff and declares ‘it’s all mine’. A signpost as to how far the world’s idea of marriage has strayed from God’s view is the existence of prenuptial agreements. There’s a step you take when you get married, where everything you have becomes each other’s. But even if we didn’t look at dividing stuff within a relationship, all the money-worries you can face in life (‘Can I afford this?’ ‘How will I pay that bill?’ ‘What will happen if I don’t get that job?’) get shared, and risk getting magnified. You’ll have seen it, we’re sure: two people, both stressed, winding each other right up, until a tough situation feels crushingly impossible. So what to do? Again, keep Jesus at the centre of your life. Money isn’t a safe place for your trust. If it’s getting the most attention in your relationship and not God, it’s time for your priorities to change. It’s tough, but striking that balance between being a ‘good steward’ of what God gives you, and not putting your trust in it above your trust in Him, is well worth striving for. And it’s worth remembering that He doesn’t bless you so you can have ‘wealth and luxury’ (Proverbs 21:20 NLT) for yourself: He blesses you so you can bless others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Marriage should be honoured...for God will judge the adulterer and...the...immoral.' Hebrews 13:4 NIV </p>
<p>We tend to think of love as a feeling. But love is really an act of our will. Sometimes, we’re not in that happy–place of ‘feeling’ loving toward our family members or friends or spouses. That happens, it’s normal. In those moments, you can ‘love’ someone through a decision to put them first. It’s true, even if you’re not quite ‘feeling’ you even like them at that exact moment. Great. But it works another way too. Sometimes, even after you’ve committed to someone, a bright–sparkly new someone walks past with a cute smile, and your heart begins to wonder (and wander) after them instead. Unfortunately this is not unusual, but normal. In that moment, your commitment should be a decision to not smile back, to not entertain the thought–train that pops into your mind... a strong, self–imposed NO. STOP. In a culture that doesn’t seem to value commitment, we’ve been told that ‘how I feel’ in that moment is what’s important. That’s a recipe for a life of not–really–ever trusting anyone, or knowing the intimacy that God designed relationships to contain. Bad news: our feelings aren’t always trustworthy. Sometimes our feelings of love need to be topped up with will–power. (Some more advice. Not every relationship is right. Also normal. Use that same will–power to assess if a relationship is right and healthy for you both, rather than feeling trapped by expectations.) Read 2 Corinthians 10:5. Take a few minutes to consider what ‘taking captive a thought’ might look like for you. How could you present such a captive thought to God so He can deal with it for you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Friend, do what you came to do.' Matthew 26:50 NCV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Whip out the placards. Strike up the marching bands. Get some rubber tyres burning. Today, we’re looking at Matthew 18, where Jesus says that if people don’t repent, then they should be treated ‘like a pagan or a tax collector’. That’s Matthew 18:15–17. Read that, then get crafting those hateful signs and flags. Back? Good. Before we start the pagan purge, it’s worth looking up what Jesus meant by treating someone ‘like a pagan or a tax collector’. Ok, they were the lowest life-form as far as the Jews were concerned. But funnily enough, whenever we see Jesus interacting with any sinners, pagans or tax collectors, it doesn’t look anything like today’s public protests.</p>
<p>Jesus shows each sinner He meets a soft heart and honest care. When He came across someone who He disagreed with, ‘<em>Jesus, looking at him, loved him</em>.’ (Mark 10:21 ESV) When He met an outcast tax collector, He told him: ‘<em>I must stay at your house today</em>.’ (Luke 19:5 NIV) When Judas, His betrayer, sold Him out, He called him ‘<em>friend</em>’ (Matthew 26:50). He wasn’t pretending they weren’t sinners. But He loved them to the point of spending so much time with them that others thought He was just as drunk and sinful as them. He didn’t care that others saw Him as naïve or mistaken—everything He did was to show sinners a way to a restored connection with the Father. What would Jesus have you do and say regarding the unrepentant, ‘least–worthy’ person you know? Make a mini placard that bears His message of love to them.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Friends sharpen the minds of each other.' Proverbs 27:17 CEV<br /><br /></p>
<p>1 Samuel 18 has two strong friends performing an ancient covenant ritual. This was a bit like playground ‘blood brothers’, but much more serious—a promise to cover the other person’s back until death. ‘<em>After David had finished talking with Saul, he met Jonathan, the king’s son. There was an immediate bond between them…Jonathan made a solemn pact with David, because he loved him as he loved himself. Jonathan sealed the pact by taking off his robe and giving it to David, together with his tunic, sword, bow and belt</em>.’ (1 Samuel 18:1–4 NLT)</p>
<p>It’s a peculiar bit of Bible passage, isn’t it? Why would Jonathan go to those (probably fairly chilly) extremes to prove his friendship—what’s wrong with a coffee and a chat? Jonathan does something humble and costly by making a covenant with David. He’s the king’s son and heir to the throne. By handing over his tunic, sword and belt, he symbolises giving up his inheritance to David. Jonathan is dressing David to be the next king. <em>Wow</em>. The highest form of friendship puts others before ourselves. Do you want the best for your mate or do you secretly, even mentally, one–up them, so you have the higher status? Do you give up the things that you’ve been privileged with for your friends’ sakes? 1 Corinthians 13:4–5 NLT tells us, ‘…<em>Love is patient and kind... not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.</em>’ Every time you ‘covet’ something today, do a good deed for the person whose stuff you’ve wanted.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Two people are better off than one.' Ecclesiastes 4:9 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ok, maybe we’re risking getting a little primary school here, but we reckon it’s worth it. We don’t care how old you are, the whole making friends thing is always relevant. It doesn’t really get any easier, does it? Whenever we hit a new stage in our life, we can find ourselves feeling that familiar ‘how do I make friends?’ feeling. So here’s some practical tips.</p>
<p>First of all, try talking. Practice really does make perfect. Don’t worry about being witty and original—just try speaking. This will build your confidence as well as allowing others an opportunity to get to know you.</p>
<p>Second, learn to listen. You don’t have to have a life–or–death story of ‘How I scaled Everest without an inhaler’ for people to want to talk to you. Actually people generally love talking about themselves so, by listening, you give them a chance to be centre stage.</p>
<p>Thirdly, have the courage to be you. Don’t apologise for the lame bands you like or pretend to be the ‘life and soul’ if you’re more happy with a quiet coffee and a chat. You’re a masterpiece in God’s eyes (even if there’s a bit of spiritual renovation still to go). And finally, choose your friends. There will always be cliques and tribes who think everyone should know their place (yawn). But there will also be those not bothered about ‘who’s in’ and ‘who’s out’. People who won’t judge you are going to make better friends anyway. So, thank God for the people around you. If you feel like there’s something missing for you, people–wise, ask God to fill that gap somehow. He put you together and He not only knows you need friendships, but what sort as well.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He will give you the mighty inner strengthening of His Holy Spirit.' Ephesians 3:16 TLB<br /><br /></p>
<p>The author Edith Schaeffer came up with the idea that Heaven’s museum has two exhibits. In the first one there’s a display of Satan’s weapons, his trials and torments thrown against God’s people. They’re in pieces—broken when God miraculously stepped in. The second shows Satan’s weapons broken when believers couldn’t see God in their situation but trusted He was good anyway, and so they overcame.</p>
<p>Collapsing beneath the weight of everything around you? Just about done with your secrets, failures and weaknesses? And, worst of all, does it feel like God isn’t going to show up to help? If you’re the sort of person who seems to see God miraculously moving in everyone else’s life, but gets frustrated at the silence in your own, there absolutely is something for you, too. There is no worse–off Christian ‘class’ that gets less than others. God promises strength for you, a mighty inner strength that comes from above and girds your heart with iron. You’ve got the Holy Spirit in there already, so it’s a case of praying to Someone closer than close. Meditating on God’s Word can be a useful prayer–tool for that. Meditating isn’t a spooky other–world–y thing—it’s simply slowly down and actively looking at what God said.</p>
<p>A good way to meditate is to go through these five steps: <em>Pause</em> (slow down and think deeply about what Scripture you’re reading), <em>Presence</em> (acknowledge God is present, speaking to you through His Word), <em>Perspective</em> (what did it mean to those it was originally written to), <em>Ponder</em> (how does it apply to your life?) and <em>Promise</em> (take away a promise from God for your life.) Practise with today’s verse. Stop and examine it, using these five steps.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'We share in His sufferings...that we may also share in His glory.' Romans 8:17 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Who wouldn’t want to follow Christ? He is the Way, the Truth and Life. He is the bridge between you and eternity. He has your healing in His hand and forgiveness for your wrong. He has your purpose, meaning and direction. He is light in your darkness. He is love hanging on a cross. He knows you and loves you with a perfect love.</p>
<p>True. And some of us have got the idea that all He expects in return is for us to relax in His grace and wait until our number is called for Heaven. Right? Wrong. If you’re thinking God owes you, you’d best read your Bible. God’s goal for you isn’t comfort; it’s Christ–like–ness. And to head in that direction, you’ll have to experience some of the stuff Jesus did—like being misunderstood or betrayed or facing rejection. Basically, it isn’t an easy ride. Jesus said, ‘<em>If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross</em>…’ (Matthew 16:24 ESV) God’s goal isn’t comfort. Still want to follow Him? To be Christ–like in this broken world will take some serious, deep, re–moulding of us. If you want the good stuff you’ve got to take the tough stuff. Remember: ‘<em>We share in His suffering…that we may also share in His glory</em>.’ (Romans 8:17 NIV) God wants to get you out of your comfort zone so the only place you’ll be comfortable is in Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Lord has hidden Himself...but I trust Him.' Isaiah 8:17 GNT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Once upon a time being part of God’s family all seemed so simple. Heart ascending a ladder to Heaven during worship. Bible verses leaping from the pages. Prayer was a spine–tingling soul–stirring experience. But then... one day the songs all sounded the same, the Bible was tougher than trigonometry, and prayers seemed to bounce off the ceiling. What happened? Did you sin once too often? Did God have a huff? Are you not singing loud enough? God isn’t a tease. He doesn’t ditch you when a better offer comes His way. Nor does He drop the whole ‘would have died for you if you were the only human on earth’ thing because your Bible reading has gone skewiff. Sometimes it may feel like God has hidden Himself for a while. No, He isn’t playing at cosmic peek-a-boo; He’s working on your maturity. He’s not even playing a ‘long game’ of chess, with you as a piece. This is about Him being yours, and you being His, in the very best way. God wants to grow us into people who are more interested in being with Him than in receiving the gifts He delights in giving us. If a relationship with Him consisted only of fuzzy feelings during our favourite songs, we’d never grow up. God is still with us even when we don’t ‘feel’ Him. Sometimes He prioritises trust over emotions. Faith, not feelings, is what pleases Him (Hebrews 11:6). There’s something to be said about prayer and worship and Bible time, when you’re not ‘feeling’ the benefit. Although it’s difficult, stick with it; the discipline will mature you. Also remember, God says, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’ (Hebrews 13:5 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God has not given us a spirit of fear.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Jesus doesn’t want us to spend our lives worrying. During His ‘Sermon on the Mount’, He essentially writes it off it as useless: ‘<em>Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?</em>’ (Matthew 6:27 NIV) He’s right (shocker). It is useless and we should be able to cast it aside.</p>
<p>But we can’t always do that so easily. Paul’s advice to worriers in his letter to the Philippians is pretty standard Christian advice, but it’s still mega–useful: <em>pray</em>. Replace bad habit with good habit. Don’t hold back the things you’re stressing about from God. He’s big enough, and wise enough, to handle anything you’ve got swirling around your head. In fact, one of the names for the Holy Spirit is ‘Counsellor’, so helping us when we feel overwhelmed is one of His specialties. Praying about worry can sometimes feel like ‘just the Christian task to do’, but it’s actually how we put ourselves in the hands of the Father who comforts us. It’s no trite task. The next time you feel particularly worried about something, take Paul’s advice and just hammer out a prayer. You don’t have to feel guilty about not having had your eyes fixed on Him. Obviously the ideal is for us to ask God into everything from the get–go, but even if we turn to Him at the last min</p>
<p>ute, He will still smile, reach down and pick us up. Every time you worry about something today, even the smallest thing, write it down. Then, write a prayer about it. Cross the worries out once they’re dealt with.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger.' Ephesians 4:31 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Pretty much everyone gets angry, including people we think are ‘super holy’ Christians. There are thousands of reasons we get angry and a lot of them come from having to deal with other people. Ever since there’s been a Church, there have been problems with members of Christ’s Body getting angry with one another. That’s why Paul wrote about how God wants His people to respond to their anger.</p>
<p>Anger itself isn’t bad, but it’s what we decide to do with it that can be seriously destructive. That’s why Paul says in Ephesians 4:26 NIV, <em>‘In your anger, do not sin</em>’ (quoting the Greek translation of Psalm 4:4). He meant: ‘Sure, you’ll get angry sometimes but, when you do, make sure you don’t do anything stupid.’ Anger makes a great mixer for sin. It has all the right flavours: the turning inwards, the impulse to only think about yourself, the rashness. Instead of letting our anger control us, Paul advises us to just dump the whole lot down the drain: ‘<em>Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger.</em>’ (Ephesians 4:31 NIV)</p>
<p>Really easy to say, way harder to do. Choosing to let go of our anger when we’ve been hurt by someone doesn’t always feel like the natural thing to do. It’s difficult, but not only is it better for us in the long run, it’s what God has done for us. God doesn’t hold His anger against us because He chose to let go of it and forgive. Next time you get explosively angry at someone or something, it’s a good idea to leave the room. Pray about the anger and hand the situation over to God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'See to it that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble.' Hebrews 12:15 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Obsessing over how you’ve been wronged and how you are so in the right can make you feel better. A bit. It does, however, make you a seriously sad person to be around, for everyone else. God doesn’t like it either. Choosing to let go of your bitterness when someone’s ‘wronged you’ is hard but it’s what He asks us to do: ‘<em>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you</em>.’ (Ephesians 4:32 NIV)</p>
<p>The thing is, forgiveness isn’t impossible. Because it’s been made possible. As Jesus was being crucified, some of His last words were: ‘<em>Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing</em>.’ (Luke 23:34 NIV) That’s THE example of forgiveness we’re given, which you might think is pretty insane. You may think that Jesus was well within His rights not to forgive the people who were in the process of murdering Him. Instead of holding onto His anger and bitterness, He let it go and forgave them. Incredible, right? It’s made even more impressive when you remember that the people responsible for torturing Him didn’t rush up at the last moment to say, ‘Oh Jesus, I’ve seen the error of my ways! I’m so sorry that I’ve done this. What can I do to make amends?’ No, that’s not what happened. They continued to kill Him. And He continued to forgive them.</p>
<p>Think back to when you were a little kid. Make a list of the things from back then that still make you angry. God made all those ‘impossible forgive-nesses’ possible. Why wait to ask Him to work His power of forgiveness in your mind and heart?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Oh, that I knew where I might find Him.' Job 23:3 NKJ <br /><br /></p>
<p>Job is a gritty book that doesn’t avoid the difficult questions. A lot of what happens to Job seems unfair—he loses his family, security and health in the opening chapters. The rest is dedicated to people trying to wrap their minds around what he did to deserve it all. We hear Job’s pain, we feel his grief, and we come across three of his well–meaning friends with some suspect theology.</p>
<p>Yet through it all, Job keeps his eyes looking up to God, despite his clouds of doubt. He had massive struggles at times but he refused to accept the blame his friends were trying to make him shoulder. He also refused, despite the painful circumstances, to blame God; instead he tried to make sense of them. He tried desperately to find God, and work out what He was up to, rather than assume He wasn’t there for him. In his struggle, his desire is: ‘<em>Oh, that I knew where I might find Him</em>.’ (Job 23:3 NKJ) Are you going through a rough ride? Maybe you’re feeling broken, at a loss, hurting, with or without an explanation. If so, take a note from Job, whose quiet times weren’t so quiet—groans, moans, tears, shouts are all in there. Cries and sighs are just as legit as words (Romans 8:26)—God knows what you mean. And if Job tells us anything about how to go through those tough times, it’s this: take your pain to God. So when you need to have some unquiet quiet–time with God, go somewhere private. Whatever is going on inside you, good or bad, talk to Him as honestly (and loudly) as you need to.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'A thorn in the flesh was given to me...' 2 Corinthians 12:7 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>A jab from a rosebush isn’t the end of the world. You may bleed a little, but that’s about it. Thorns of the New Testament were a different beast altogether. Nature’s brutal weapon of choice in the desert more accurately describes them. These things really made their point (pardon the pun).</p>
<p>Paul’s statement from 2 Corinthians 12:7 becomes all the stranger: he accepted the fact that God had sent to messenger of Satan with an agonising ‘thorn’ to help him! <em>Help</em>? Say, what?!</p>
<p>It’s true that wasn’t his first conclusion. Something had to change in Paul; at first he begged God to remove it. Three times he begged. But over time, he learned to not only accept it, but to celebrate it. The weakness it brought had a way of drawing God’s strength out. Accepting his limitations allowed God to work through him. The gift of a thorn takes Paul to the cross: ‘<em>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me</em>.’ (Galatians 2:20 NIV)</p>
<p>So think about this: if you’ve been complaining about your own thorny issue, perhaps God is using it to highlight your limitations. Spend a moment thanking Him for the work He’s doing, or planning, through that issue. Ask God to use your weakness to draw out His strength.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I will not let you go unless you bless me.' Genesis 32:26 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Jacob was a sinner. He took what wasn’t his: first he cheated his older brother, Esau, to get his father’s blessing. Then he cheated his father–in–law, Laban, so he could get wealthy. Even his name meant <em>deceiver</em>—this guy knew he didn’t deserve goodness. So, he ran off in fear.</p>
<p>Then one night the ‘Angel of the Lord’ showed up as Jacob was left alone and was trying to figure out how to deal with his furious brother. Jacob wrestled with the Angel all through the night until daybreak. As you do, right? Actually, it’s one of the weirder stories in the Bible. It’s found in Genesis 32:22–32 and tells us Jacob had the gall to fight and refuse to give up, despite injury, until God blessed him.</p>
<p>Jacob was a sinner. Like you, and us. But he wasn’t going to let go of God. So God gave him a new name: <em>Israel</em>. (Yep, this is where the name comes from!) Israel meant <em>prince with God</em> or <em>wrestles with God</em>. His identity was totally changed. No longer driven by fear, he turned to healing his wounded family relationships. This kind of transformation isn’t only on offer to special guys from the Bible thousands of years ago—it’s for us too! The Bible says, ‘<em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!</em>’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) Have you ever asked God what unimaginable things He might have for your life? Or what family relationships He might want you to have a part in healing? Talk to Him tonight about them before you go to sleep.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'&quot;For I know the plans I have for you,&quot; declares the Lord, &quot;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.&quot;' Jeremiah 29:11 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ever had someone at church try to cheer you up with Jeremiah 29:11? People often use that verse in a ‘God has plans, so no sads, ever’ sort of way. But, God’s plan won’t always be what we want for our lives...</p>
<p>The Israelites (the people God was speaking to in this verse) had put their hopes and plans above God’s, and were unpleasantly surprised when they ended up in a place they didn’t expect to be. They were taken captive by their enemies, the Babylonians. The verse before Jeremiah 29:11 (imaginatively called Jeremiah 29:10) says: ‘<em>When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfil my good promise to bring you back…</em>’ So the thing which the Israelites really wanted, to be freed and go back home, wouldn’t happen for 70 years. 70 years! That’s 280 more issues of <em>word4U2day</em>! It’s a pretty long time to wait for something you want. They must have been gutted when they heard Jeremiah 29:10 (although they probably called it differently back then…)</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>God promises them that it isn’t hopeless and that they can do well in their lives, even though they’re not where they expected to be. If we trust God with what’s in front of us, good things can come even out of our most unexpected disappointments. So spend some time thinking about what you’ve had in mind for your life that hasn’t lined up in the way your expected. Talk to God about any disappointment you’ve experienced because your ideas don’t align with His. Then pray about changing your plans to line up with His.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He came seeking fruit on it and found none.' Luke 13:6 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Jesus said: ‘<em>A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, “For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?” “Sir,” the man replied, “leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilise it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.”</em>’ (Luke 13:6–9 NIV) How long have you been a Christian? Figured out yet that it’s more than being ‘good’?</p>
<p>Like we said in yesterday’s reading, God really does have a plan for us, which is definitely exciting. And, it tends to mean engaging with the world around us and doing stuff, rather than hiding away. God made you with a specific set of skills and there will be heaps of ways you can use those skills to worship Him. This parable warns us about being lazy and not doing what God made us to do. It’s the fig tree’s job to make figs. That’s its ‘thing’. But also notice: the man looking after the tree believed that it would flourish. God wants to help you grow in Him (John 15:5) and He’ll look after you as you do. So, spend some time thinking and praying about what you’re good at (maybe ask someone who knows you well what that is?) then see if you can use it worship God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, &quot;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&quot;' Hebrews 13:5 ESV<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>People who put their trust in money often learn about the risk in the worst crash. History, anyone? In 1923 German money became practically worthless due to a series of catastrophes. The cost of a loaf of bread shot to 200,000,000,000 marks: that’s about 10 billion per slice! People lost everything. Looking back over the last 100 years you can see plenty of financial crises which left lives devastated—some closer to home.</p>
<p>Money isn’t the answer to life’s problems; it doesn’t love you or free you and it isn’t reliable. It can be tempting to trust in providing for yourself but we are called to completely trust in God, in all things, no matter how uncomfortable that can make us. It can feel incredibly awkward stepping out into places or careers that God’s called us to, not knowing where the support will come from. But He says: ‘<em>I will never leave you nor forsake you</em>.’ That certainly doesn’t mean ‘lie back and do nothing because God will make money rain from the sky’—generally we are called to work in some way. It does mean however, that you can completely trust God with your whole financial future, no matter what crises hits. It also means that everything we’re given is His in the first place; it’s never really ours to hold onto, which is a pretty good springboard thought to help us get our hearts around living generously. If giving to others isn’t something you can sustain right now, ask God that you would have the means to live contentedly and joyfully, provided for by Him. He will make a way.</p>

<p>Icons are what you click on when you want to open a program on a computer—a little picture of a disc, a sheet of paper, a fox snuggling the earth (yeah, we know, other internet browsers are available). You go through icons to get to the program you want. You and I are icons. We’re shortcuts to God. Of all the wonderful things in this universe—fiery stars in the sky, giant sea beasts that churn up waters, the booming and rumble of mighty storms—we are what looks most like God.</p>
<p>Look through the New Testament for clues. It says that you and I are made to be like God’s Son (Romans 8:29). Yep, us. Not the stars, not the sky, not the earth. We are the ones called to be like God’s Son. So—if we look closely at you, or you look closely at us (failing–saved–by–grace real people)—we all get to see beyond ourselves, to a bit of God. If you hear our stories, or we hear yours, He’s bursting through them; more so than He does through the mightiest waterfall or biggest cosmic storm. Even your favourite Christian author or legend is not perfect. He or she is a normal human being and therefore flawed round the edges. However, think about all the Godly things they did (or are doing) with their lives. So, even though you’re also flawed around the edges, that doesn’t mean you’ve blown it so badly in God’s eyes He can’t use you to help others big time. God is an expert at doing a perfect work through an imperfect vessel—like you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Use wisdom and understanding to establish your home.' Proverbs 24:3 CEV</p>
<p>Paintbrushes exist because our hands alone can’t do more than fingerpaint. Hammers do a better job with nails than our elbows or foreheads. Tools are for tasks we can’t do with our bodies. And if you don’t have a paintbrush but you want to paint, you simply go out and get one—you don’t wallow in despair about how difficult it is to use your hair as a paintbrush.</p>
<p>In the Bible, James says, ‘<em>If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God</em>.’ (James 1:5 NRS) Wisdom’s a tool, there for the getting. Wisdom’s not a magic wand, or some grey–haired expert that you’ll morph into at the end of your Christian walk. It’s there to help you build your life together, today. Tools are for tasks we can’t do with what we’ve got within ourselves, and wisdom is for those times when real life situations—temptations, hard choices, troubled friends—get the better of our normal ability to cope. You use wisdom in your everyday life, in the middle of temptations and hard choices. You get it, just as James says, by asking God plainly and directly for it. So pick it up and practise. If the ability to make wise choices seems impossibly distant, start small and start with the choices in front of you today. If you really want the ability to say, ‘I’m a wise person,’ then ask God for the opportunity to make one small, wise choice today. Take it in steps, so that by the end of the month you can look back and count the wise choices you’ve made.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Be fruitful...multiply...and govern.' Genesis 1:28 NLT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>God created Adam to work creation before mankind ‘<em>fell</em>’ (Genesis 2:15). Work wasn’t punishment—it was a good thing, a job to do, as part of tending Creation… Adam and Eve were intended to represent God to Creation—to ‘<em>reign over</em>’ it (Genesis 1:26 NLT), in the same sort of way that God does, through looking after it and growing it well. He gave them a share in some of His work in that, because He delights in involving His children in upbuilding the world in love. They were also intended to represent Creation to Him. The joy they were to find in growing that world for Him was meant to inspire them to make a conscious choice to thank Him. They were to be like excited kids, asked to plant cress seeds by a parent who anticipates them running back, yelling, ‘Come and see! It’s sooo cooool!’ when the seeds sprouted.</p>
<p>God’s children were created as His partners: unequal, sure, but deeply adored joint–owners of a beautiful project. Adam and Eve’s ‘priesthood’ over Creation doesn’t mean there were modernish church–style rituals. Their priesthood was part of their God–given purpose and identity. Today, our earth isn’t the same, but our calling is:</p>
<p>(1) <em>represent God to our world</em>. Bring Him into it and ‘be Jesus’ to those who need Him.</p>
<p>(2) <em>represent it back to Him</em>. Make the choice to constantly bring it to Him in prayer.</p>
<p>A bit of a Sunday School activity to remind us of the importance of this: (1) Chop the big end off a carrot or parsnip. (2) Put the end in a saucer of water. (3) Replace the water every day, and pray as you do. (4) Watch the shoots come.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You are a... priesthood.' 1 Peter 2:9 NIV <br /><br /></p>
<p>Know anyone with ‘asbestos fingers’? Those guys who casually toss coals around when setting up a fire, or play with candles at dinner tables? In the Old Testament, priests had to be a bit like that. They were chosen to get close to God (read Hebrews 9:1–10. <em>Wow!</em>) and the things of God—closer than the rest of the people, enough to feel the searing heat, the ‘holiness that hurts the eyes’, and they were allowed to withstand it. God’s temple priests got involved with the altar, its vessels and the offerings.</p>
<p>‘High priests’ got the closest to God. They made sacrifices for sins and invited the presence of God back into the community. They were people who wore the Name of the Lord on their foreheads (Exodus 28:38). That, and what they did in that yearly ‘Day of Atonement’ service, made a way for God’s people to be close to Him again, even in their sin–filled history. And today? Peter says ‘<em>you are a priesthood</em>.’ You are a priesthood. <em>You</em>. Church tradition used to say that cherubs (the ones who somehow on our postcards got misrepresented as cute winged babies instead of sword–wielding gatekeepers) had rosy cheeks because they were the angels that flew closest to God’s throne. It was understood that the heat was close to burning their faces off. This was where the high priest could go safely—right into God’s presence, in with the angels—and this is where we’re allowed, today. How? And why? Stay tuned: more on that tomorrow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.' Isaiah 28:26 NIV <br /><br /></p>
<p>So we’ve looked at Adam and Eve as priests, we’ve looked at the Old Testament Temple priests… but can anyone think of someone who totally fulfilled this Priesthood idea, and then some? (No prizes, Sunday School veterans). Jesus. Ultimate Prophet—He revealed God to humanity. Ultimate King, He is chief–ruler–and–boss over all Creation. Ultimate Priest—in His life and even more so in His death and resurrection, Jesus enabled mankind to go back into God, and God into mankind. (That last bit there, is mind-bending. John 1:14 is a universe–shattering truth.) So that’s good. That’s really good. People could do with knowing it.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, study/work, a shopping centre, out with mates, the people around you could do with seeing God shine through you, and hearing the news that God died because He loved them so much. How? Get close to Him yourself, get close to God like in the Holy of Holies (pssst, read 1 Corinthians 6:19 for an update to the Old Testament set–up), choose to bring Him into Creation around you, and bring Creation to Him, constantly, in prayer. And bring Him into your conversations—bring that Good News into a world that needs it. You are a priest. And the more you go to Him for guidance on how to live that out, day to day, the more He’ll build you up in it, ‘instructing and teaching you’ to do it better and better. Write “P” – “R” – “I” – “E” – “S” – “T” down a page. Spend ten minutes researching the word ‘priest’ (in dictionaries, Bible concordances, whatever). From that research, note down a single–word challenge for yourself, beginning with each letter, then live it out today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.' Jonah 3:1 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Jonah said a quick ‘no’ to God. And days later, he allowed several incensed sailors to chuck him over the side of their boat and into a raging sea. That... <em>hmmm</em>... escalated quickly.</p>
<p>The thing about running from your mistakes is that the consequences have a nasty habit of blowing way out of proportion. When Jonah turned his back on God’s command, do you reckon he saw the whole ragingstorm–overboard–bellyofawhale chain of events coming? When you say ‘no’ to God, it might seem like a simple act in the moment. You might hope that’s the end of it. But hiding from God takes you to places (even if they’re only in your mind) that you wouldn’t have gone before, and you lose the path into God’s best for you. Jonah saw all this happen to him—pity it had to happen from the belly of a great fish.</p>
<p>And then Jonah 3:1 happens. In his regret, Jonah dares to glance back at God, and the whale vomits him up on the shore. There, God simply speaks again. What can we learn from this? No matter how far gone you feel you are, God will speak again and again to you. If you’re burying your head with shame, dare a glance back at Him. He won’t have gone purple with rage. Chances are He’ll love that you’ve turned to Him. Try to run from Him once, He’s willing to take your shame away. Try it twice, He’s willing to take your shame away. Three times, and it goes on... If you think God may have said something to you that you’ve rejected, ask Him to ask you again today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Seek His will... and He will show you which path to take.' Proverbs 3:6 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Ever felt a bit inferior compared to Christians in full–time ministry? It’s possible to get the idea that ‘overseas missionary’ or at least ‘full–time Christian worker’ is God’s ideal for every Christian. But what about everyone else? Is it possible to be a garbage collector and still be in the bulls–eye of God’s will for you? Well, yes. Definitely. God’s will is not a hierarchy. Even though it can be tempting to think that overseas missionaries are at the top of the tree (with Africa before Europe, and Latin America ahead of North America, obviously…) with pastors second, then youth workers, and somewhere long down the line of importance we get plumbers, mechanics, insurance sales and interns. Because, y’know, how is doing the tea run glorifying the Lord? Of course that’s ridiculous. God’s will is God’s will and, whether it involves changing nappies or changing the world, that makes it the best possible thing. Being God’s will, and all, He’s also using it to grow something in you. You might even say, He’s preparing you for Heaven, through the (even invisible) work He’s had you doing. It’s all valued to Him.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:23 NIV says, ‘<em>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord</em>…’ Notice: ‘<em>Whatever you do</em>…’ Making a cuppa, fixing a leaky tap, unblocking a loo—they can all be glorifying, if we’re giving our heart to Jesus, and serving Him through serving others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.' Romans 8:6 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>GK Chesterton once said: ‘Jesus promised His disciples three things—that they would be completely fearless, absurdly happy, and in constant trouble.’ Life, then, as a Christian, will be turned up to the max on all fronts. We’re all called to this. You’re called to this active life of pointing others to Jesus and showing God’s goodness to those around you. To help you, well, there’s the fearlessness, the happiness, and the trouble.</p>
<p>You live to do justice, love, kindness and walk humbly with your God (Micah 6:8). As you go about being God’s hands and feet to bring about that justice, kindness and humility, His perfect love will override your ‘natural’ fear of how dangerous it can all be (1 John 4:18). You’ll get pushed on by your absurd happiness (Nehemiah 8:10) in the middle of an unpredictable life. ‘<em>In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.</em>’ (John 16:33 NIV)</p>
<p>How it happens in your life will be different than the next person and partly up to you. You might get paid out for it. Praying for the sick and sharing the Gospel might sting. But in the centre of it all you’re promised that God will be there, for you. You might feel like your world is a spinning wheel. The outside might be constantly moving, but remember if you’re in the centre with God, then all is like the ‘eye’ of a storm—stillness and peace.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'This is God's will for you.' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NIV <br /><br /></p>
<p>Old married couples often have a seemingly perfect knack for finishing each other’s sentences. They’ve spent so much time together, they can practically read each other’s minds. There’s something in that talent that reminds us of the possibilities of a relationship with God... Well, ok so we’re obviously never going to finish the Creator’s sentences—‘<em>For who can know the Lord’s thoughts</em>,’ right? (Romans 11:34 NLT)</p>
<p>But spending time regularly practising the art of looking and listening for God helps us begin to know His heart. Praise and saying ‘thanks’ opens you up to God’s purposes. ‘<em>Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will</em>.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18 NIV) If you only pray when you’re desperate for answers, your receptors become rusty; praying regularly with God sharpens your senses and fine–tunes your ability to understand His Word and stay in His Will amidst the noise: ‘<em>Teach me to do Your will…my God; may Your good Spirit lead me on level ground</em>.’ (Psalm 143:10 NIV) Seek God, and He will smooth the path for you. It’s good to chat with wise Christians for their take on life–stuff, and it’s even more important to chat with God for His. Ultimately, it’s Him who works things out. Often God leads, and then uses others to confirm what He was saying. So, tell God all about that–thing–you–need–His–direction–with. Ask Him to draw your mind to His will. Now just sit with Him for a few minutes—praying and reading the Bible. Don’t worry too much if your thoughts start to wander, just pray through everything that comes to mind.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts.' Colossians 3:15 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Sometimes, the doors that we’ve been pushing, and thinking of as the next step in God’s plan, turn out to be locked. No matter how much we use our head as a battering ram, that–thing–we–were–chasing (chasing even with God–centred intentions) can seem a dead end. So what do we do when things don’t seem to go to plan? Well, actually, we should probably redefine that whole plan thing. Here’s the truth: sometimes our view of the plan isn’t from the best position. So what we were expecting may not happen.</p>
<p>But God is sovereign. (That means: <em>He rules</em>.) He has you safely in His hands. That doesn’t mean heartbreaking things don’t happen sometimes.</p>
<p>But know this: He’s holding you within His plan, and He’ll eventually bring you to the right door. And it’ll be unlocked. While you’re standing in the corridor–of–life (did we take the metaphor too far...? Just run with it), have peace. Know that He is the Sovereign Door. ‘<em>Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.”</em>’ (John 10:7 ESV) He’s in control. In today’s verse, the term ‘<em>rule</em>’ in Greek, is the kind of direction that a referee gives, it’s about directing decisions that allow a game to continue, not about ruling like a king with an iron fist. Peace isn’t just peace; it’s a compass that God uses to direct our hearts to new doors. So take a moment to think of all the wrong doors you might have gone through in life and thank Him for the times He’s sent you back to look for Him, the true Door.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I seek not to please Myself but Him who sent Me.' John 5:30 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Let’s chat about doors again. As we discussed yesterday, God WILL bring you to the right door, in the right timing. Look at Paul, He met closed doors to Asia and Bithynia, and instead God opened the door to Macedonia for him (Acts 16:6–10). Our role, then? We push. He unlocks the doors, but He wants us to push on them.</p>
<p>There’s no use standing staring at an unlocked door, when you could have been through it five minutes ago just by trying it. God is that Sovereign Door and He’ll make sure that you only ever make it through to the right path, as long as you’re constantly asking Him to keep you within His will. (Or, being sure to ‘seek ye first the Kingdom of God’, as the old song goes…) So if life’s presenting you with options, be wise. But also rest in knowing that you can trust God’s plans and His kindness. And just, simply, give some doors a try. You may not see a big blue neon sign telling you what to do, but you will at least begin to get an inkling if God is calling you to do something, or not. When you try doors and are listening for God’s voice, the wrong ones will shut when you push. Opportunities will arise to lead you to the right ones, and decisions will be waiting upon you. Chase that Colossians 3:15 peace by seeking what pleases God.</p>
<p>Ready for a prophetic action? Go open your front door, and stand just inside it. Say aloud, ‘God, I step into your plans. I trust they’ll be the best version of my future. I’ll pursue them to please You.’ Then take that step out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares.' Hebrews 12:1 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>What sort of attitudes weigh you down? There are nine C’s the Lord wants us to put aside: <em>Carelessness</em>, a <em>Critical</em> spirit, <em>Compromise</em>, <em>Conformity</em> to worldly values, <em>Coldness</em> of heart, <em>Cruelty</em>, lack of <em>Control</em>, lack of <em>Commitment</em> or <em>Confidence</em> in Him. God’s tolerance when it comes to sin is zero.</p>
<p>For our good, and for His kingly glory, He isn’t gentle with our darker sides. He wants us to be able to come face to face with Him—with Love Himself—and in order to do that, He’ll go straight for the things that have us ensnared, ripping them out at the roots. Our wrong actions turn us away from God. If we keep going past repeated warnings from Him that our sinful thoughts and behaviour isn’t good for us, we might have to learn these lessons the hardest possible way.</p>
<p>Yet God can still use the mess we end up in to lead us out of the snare of sin. But, that’ll hurt. That’ll be uncomfortable. Unpleasant. Ugly. So, how about we avoid that place of regrets and make a move first? When we choose to ask God for help to lay aside every deadweight, every old attitude problem, every sinful thought and action, He’ll be there! He’s just waiting to be asked. So let’s get serious about the nine things God’s serious with: <em>love</em>, <em>joy</em>, <em>peace</em>, <em>patience</em>, <em>kindness</em>, <em>goodness</em>, <em>faithfulness</em>, <em>gentleness</em> and <em>self-control</em>.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You shall not give false testimony.' Exodus 20:16 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Fibs. Tales. Whoppers. There are loads of different names for lies. Often it’s because people view the name as relative to the size of the lie. You’ll hear things like: ‘It’s only a little white lie.’ But, wait a minute. Two days ago we were chatting about God seeing the heart, so, to God, dishonesty is dishonesty—there’s no in–between. So, what about half truths, lying to ourselves or staying silent and withholding info that could bring truth into a situation? Brace yourself. Here’s the harsh reality: ‘<em>The Lord detests lying lips, but He delights in people who are trustworthy.</em>’ (Proverbs 12:22 NIV) Why? Because God is truth (John 14:6). There’s no part of God that dwells in dishonesty or lies, so when we participate in that stuff we’re allowing something other than God to be a part of our lives. Oops. So, how do we guard against it? Firstly, we need to recognise the impact of lies. James 3:5 NIV compares lies to a spark: ‘<em>Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark</em>.’ Ok, so it’s fairly major. Secondly, we need to pray. Psalm 141:3 NIV says: ‘<em>Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.</em>’ The more in tune we are with God, the more truth we’ll speak. And if we’re only speaking truth, there’s no room for lies. Do you watch any soapies or TV dramas? Consider how many of the storylines are made more dramatic by characters telling lies. And do you stretch the truth sometimes too? Think about it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You shall not covet.' Exodus 20:17 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>On its own, the word for ‘covet’ (<em>chamad</em>) here just means <em>desire</em>, and isn’t a bad thing. What makes the coveting an evil thing is the fact that it’s someone else’s thing. Translation: it doesn’t belong to you, and you want it anyway. So why is it bad to see your friend with the newest PhonePadTechylookingthing and fall over yourself to get one too? Well, it’s not particularly honouring to them. It’s a missed opportunity to ‘<em>rejoice with those who rejoice</em>’ (Romans 12:15 NIV), and it’s really quite self–centred. And in the ‘<em>you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife</em>’ (Exodus 20:17 NIV) part of the verse, dishonouring becomes dehumanising. Sometimes we treat people as bodies to lust after or wish we had instead of our own. Or how about that one person who seems to have it all perfect? And you just wish you could be them? Same: not good for anyone. Coveting people or their things (and yes, if it is a shop’s thing, it is still coveting…) becomes a worship–full experience and then we’re ‘worship–empty’ when we go before God. We have no space left for Him, because we tried to feed this hunger within ourselves with the wrong stuff or people. If we get what we wanted so desperately we still wouldn’t be satisfied. We’d want more. That desire to be filled is a Jesus–shaped space only He can actually, truly fill. The next (affordable—chocolate, a CD, lipstick, whatever) thing that you find yourself ‘chamad’–ing in a shop… buy it. Then give it away to someone who you know’d like it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly Kingdom... Amen!' 2 Timothy 4:18 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Paul lived most of his Christian walk in the thick of it. At the start of Acts 20, we read all the places he’s been taking the Gospel message to thousands who hadn’t yet heard about Jesus. Big task, that. Consider it a bit like a <em>Die Hard</em> mission week. His mission week involved this: ‘<em>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked</em>...’ (2 Corinthians 11:25 NIV) Those kinds of things defined Paul’s others–focussed life. If you go to Paul’s list of struggles in 2 Corinthians 11:24–28, you’ll probably find something you can relate to. Paul was lonely, tired and in danger almost permanently. Where’s the room for ‘joy’ there, then? Here’s what he had to say: ‘<em>None of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy</em>.’ (Acts 20:24 NKJ) Bit of a plot twist, that. So, what did Paul have on his side? In his last letter, only months before he died, Paul wrote this to Timothy: ‘<em>But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength...The Lord will rescue me.</em>’ (2 Timothy 4:17–18 NIV) For him to get through all the trials of his past, and confidently face the hazy future, he needed to believe that God was greater than anything he would be faced with. He needed faith. Simple as. Guess what! God still pulls out all the stops for us today. Give your struggles to Him today and run your race with joy.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Ezra...stood on a platform...which they had made for the purpose.' Nehemiah 8:4 NKJ <br /><br /></p>
<p>Jerusalem had been rubble until Nehemiah rebuilt the ruined city into a liveable place. The architect even threw in a custom–built preaching platform as part of the deal. As Ezra stood on the platform speaking for the sixth hour about what God had done (and you thought your church service went on a bit!), the people wept and sang and cheered. A ‘platform’ is anything that makes you noticeable and allows you to be heard.</p>
<p>Who needs a specially–built stand when your phone’s a stage? The internet’s given you Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest—you now have the chance to be in the lives of your friends and family every day. So what are you going to do with those platforms? Be a beacon. Be an internet encourager. Don’t let low confidence or a jaded feeling send a bullet through your hope. It might be something as simple as posting a quote or a link to <em>word4U2day</em> on Facebook, so that people see how God is mixed in with the flavour of your everyday food snaps. Or better, speak to those friends that you know could do with a word–lift or send an encouraging web–link you know will make them smile deep–deep–down in the place that needs to know Jesus is Lord, and that He loves them. ...Who knows what your feed could accomplish today?</p>
<p>By bringing God’s word to people, Ezra saw a huge response. Open that social media app and bring God’s word to someone today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Lord, how can I save Israel?... I am the least in my father's house.' Judges 6:15 NLT <br /><br /></p>
<p>Poor old Gideon; possibly shut up tight inside himself, a shy child, troubled with doubt and boxed in by anxiety. Hiding in a silo, out of the way… when suddenly, in bursts adventure—God calls nervous Gideon to take on the Midianites. Talk about an uneven match. It’s like dropping the kid picked last in PE into mortal combat with an elite battle squadron. You can hear Gideon’s brain ticking, ‘Me Lord? You’ve got the wrong guy... I don’t have the strength or the brains. I *can’t* do it.’ And he was right! Gideon had more chance of downing a bear with a sneeze than defeating an entire army. He wasn’t up to the job. God, however, was (and is).</p>
<p>Faith is trusting God with the impossible. It is placing confidence in the One who can ‘…<em>present you...before the presence of His glory with great joy</em>.’ (Jude 1:24 ESV) Gideon was a mighty warrior, he just didn’t know it. God orchestrated a series of events designed to open up, and unfold his warrior within. Perhaps you can relate? You sense God is asking something too big of you. You feel tied up in knots. Fear is a dark shadow bearing down on you. On your own you can’t face the challenge, let alone overcome. God, however, can. And He promises, ‘<em>Don’t be afraid…I am with you</em>.’ (Isaiah 41:10 NLT) If you feel boxed into any kind of silo today, ask God to help you step out of your ‘impossible’ and into His ‘possible’.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Not in human wisdom but in the power of God.' 1 Corinthians 2:5 NLT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>*WHY* are Christians considered ‘weird’? Is it because we hang around in churches, and believe there’s more to life than meets the eye? Are we ‘Jesus freaks’ because we live radically, spiritually, God–trusting lives? Because we make decisions the world doesn’t understand, knowing that Jesus will carry us through what He asks of us? Does that last one excite you? It excites us… The Bible is full of people who risk looking ‘weird’ by taking God at His word, straight up.</p>
<p>The book of Exodus would’ve been far shorter if Moses had just dipped a toe in the Red Sea, yelped at the cold and hopped around a bit. David wouldn’t have reached the palace if he’d chosen to leave his slingshot in his pocket. The world would look a lot different had Noah chosen to build a patio to soak up the sun. The common bond between these three, and so many more, is faith. (Oh, wait. And another thing: their fearsome Old Testament beards). It’s a risky business stepping into the waves expecting them to part, or going toe–to–toe with the world’s most colossal soldier, or building a boat in the desert. But these people are famous throughout history because they trusted in God. The power of God is above our reasoning, and beyond our com-fort. If living with faith is a risky business, have a practice today. Pray for one of your friends, (or someone who isn’t yet your friend, if you’re feeling really brave), asking God how you can encourage them. Then pray for help to do it.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'With long life I will satisfy them.' Psalm 91:16 NRS<br /><br /></p>
<p>Yes, Heaven will be nice. The Bible describes it in this way: ‘<em>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away</em>.’ (Revelation 21:4 ESV) But what about today? Can’t life be painless now?’ In the mystery of what we know about Heaven, we know that God will take complete care of us, for good. But what about when we step out of our front doors into the world of illness, doubt, and unsure walks through dodgy alleys? God says He has our backs.</p>
<p>Have a read of Psalm 91. Those words aren’t sweet nothings from on high—they’re grounded on an God’s promise to take care of those who remain in Him. For example, in Genesis 15 God essentially says to Abram, ‘I’ll tear myself apart before I’ll go back on my promise.’ He means it when He says that His<em> 'faithfulness is a shield</em>.’ (Psalm 91:4 ESV)</p>
<p>That’s for today, in the worst fear, in our illnesses and when we’re in danger. He promised it. But it’s not a pledge of ‘cotton wool’ protection. Remember, the Bible has Jesus’ terrible death, not to mention a pretty beaten–up early Church. God works good from all our bad, including the pain. The world *is* dangerous. It won’t always make sense. But He gives us His Word. We can cry for His help to shield us when we’re up against pain or confusion that’s overwhelming. The one who hears is a Father who’d tear Himself apart before losing any of His kids. In your church it’s almost certain there’s someone who’s been through real pain and come through with God. Seek them out and listen to what they’ve learned.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Master...because you say so, I will.' Luke 5:5 NIV <br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>There the disciples were, gathering in their nets. They’d sweated through the nightshift without a bite. Then Jesus showed up, saying: ‘<em>Push out into deep water</em>…’ Like a carpenter would know more than a professional fisherman? ‘<em>Let your nets out for a catch</em>,’ He went on. Peter decided to humour him. ‘<em>Master…because you say so, I will</em>.’ Soon the net was so full it was about to break. Peter yelled to his partners for help.</p>
<p>Two thousand years later Jesus still shows up just as we’re about to pack up and go home. So often, He waits until we’ve reached the end of our rope, then steps in. Why? Because He likes to see us squirm in doubt and failure? Never. Too often we rely on our own abilities and only bring God in when we really need Him. But everything we do matters to Him. He cares that we have a deadline on Friday or that we’ve lost our keys. He wants to help, even in those small things. It’s a massive waste of time and a lot more stress trying to solve things on our own. Jesus doesn’t wait until we’re at the pulling–hair–out–stage of a problem before He steps in. It’s actually up to us to invite Him into the situation before it escalates. He’s there, ready to help, waiting for us to ask. Wherever you go today, when you’ve finished what you’re there to do, take ten minutes out before heading home. Spend those minutes in quiet prayer, or worshipping God. Talk to Him before you reach the end of your net.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Honour your father and your mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The first four of the TCs—Ten Commandments—are about our relationship with God. Now He turns our attention to our relationships and attitudes towards other people. Honour. It’s not a word you hear bandied about that often. (Except maybe in Disney’s <em>Mulan</em>. Does that count?...No?...) So, what exactly is ‘honour’? It means to regard something or someone with great respect. This fifth commandment is calling us to respect our family, and specifically our parents. (Or it might be more about your grandparents, your guardians or maybe even church elders.) No matter what your family situation, God is keen to see you respect and love your family in the same way He respects and loves you. He unfalteringly wants your best, and works sacrificially for it. Powerful model. This commandment is a toughie, because it can be pretty difficult to respect someone if they don’t respect you. Yet this honour should be an overflow of our love for Christ. It’s in those ‘I’m finding it difficult to love you right now, but I am anyway’ moments that we learn how Christ–like we can be. And it’s by our determination to respect our parents, guardians and families in the midst of difficulties that we show the world what it is to know God. Jesus said ‘…<em>As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this, everyone will know that you are My disciples</em>…’ (John 13:34–35 NIV) Write a thank you card to someone you look up to, whether it’s a parent/guardian/youth worker/pastor—and try to get the word honour in.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You shall not murder.' Exodus 20:13 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take a wild stab in the dark and assume that most of us haven’t killed anything bigger than a bug. Or maybe a nasty looking spider. But maybe there’s more to this commandment than the simple instruction of not physically killing another human being. We reckon there’s something in the concept of killing that still exists in our everyday life, and like yesterday’s commandment it’s to do with our attitude towards others. In Matthew 5:21–22 NLT Jesus expands on the idea of killing: ‘<em>You have heard that our ancestors were told, “You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.” But I say if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment. If you call someone an idiot you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.</em>’ Wow. Serious stuff. Not only is life sacred to God (since He created it), but He’s also telling us not to destroy someone with our words either. When we gossip about people, cruelly label or make fun of them, God hears. When we destroy a person with our mouths we’re violating this commandment, because to God, it’s a form of killing. Yes, serious stuff. James 3:8–10 NAS says: ‘...<em>the tongue...is...full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God... these things ought not to be</em>...’ So watch your words today. Which of your words bring ‘life’, and which do you need to stop before they bring ‘death’?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You shall not commit adultery.' Exodus 20:14 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Adultery. We know it’s wrong. And some of us aren’t even married, so what’s the point in looking at this? Well, we reckon there’s more to this commandment than just the instruction to not cheat on your significant other. In Matthew 5:28 NIV, Jesus said ‘…<em>I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</em>’ It reminds us that God sees the heart behind the stuff we do. It’s important we understand the sanctity (isn’t that a lovely word?) of marriage. But, more than that, it’s important we realise God is just as concerned with our spiritual condition as our physical mistakes. Don’t get us wrong; God definitely still cares when we mistreat the bodies that He’s given to us, and when we do stuff the Bible warns against. But He’s aware of the deeper stuff going on that’s causing the actions. Jeremiah 17:10 NAS says: ‘<em>I, the Lord, search the heart, I test the mind</em>…’ If we think we’re doing just fine because we haven’t actually cheated on hypothetical–spouse but inside we’re full of vulture–like thoughts, we’ve missed the point. Not only that, but those vulture–like thoughts always end up coming out (Luke 6:45). Giving ourselves to Jesus means giving Him access to clean it all up. And that changing of your attitude is what will change your actions. A great starting point when you’re offering your heart to God is Philippians 4:8 NAS: ‘<em>Whatever is true, whatever is honourable... right... pure... lovely... of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.</em>’</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You shall not steal.' Exodus 20:15 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, this is just getting silly, isn’t it? Surely most of us know not to steal? Well… this is another one of those commandments that takes a little bit more study to fully grasp. We live in a ‘what can I get out of it?’ culture. It’s the sort of environment where we can easily bend the rules and twist dishonesty and theft to get what we want. (‘Of course I never *steal*. But don’t open my iTunes library…’) Think about it. How often do we take the credit from other people? Or not give back any extra change given to us by the shop assistant? Or take stationery from work home? And when you think about it, isn’t withholding something that’s not yours the same as taking something that’s not yours? It’s all about denying the owner whatever is rightfully theirs. It gets a whole lot more serious when we think about this in the context of our relationship with God. If withholding things is a form of robbery, how often do we rob God? Are we sometimes guilty of denying Him our time, efforts or talents? Think about it this way, if ‘<em>every good and perfect gift is from above</em>…’ (James 1:17 NIV), then God is the rightful owner of all we have and all we are. So it’s probably a good idea for us to give those gifts back in some way… So is it time for a clean out? Think through things you’re holding on to that you shouldn’t be (yes, digital too). What should you do about it? Make a decision, today, and carry it out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'And God spoke all these words...' Exodus 20:1 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>When someone says you can’t do something, that’s often what we want to do. Instantly. Aren’t the TCs—Ten Commandments—like that? A set of rules humanity is almost destined to break? We reckon there’s more to them than just a set of old rules. In fact, there’s freedom in obedience, because our relationship with Jesus comes from His grace rather than the law. The commandments aren’t just about wagging the finger and warning us against sin; they teach us about how we should be living. So, (1) ‘<em>You shall have no other gods before Me</em>.’ (Exodus 20:3 NIV) God is clear on this; it’s all about allegiance. You’ve got to be committed, and that means making Him your priority. It’s no mistake that the first commandment is about the most important relationship—you and God. (2) ‘<em>You shall not make for yourself an idol</em>.’ (Exodus 20:4 NLT) Not many of us have a whopping great golden cow statue, but idols can take all sorts of forms. Anything that comes before God in your priorities is an idol. Think about it… (3) ‘<em>You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God</em>.’ (Exodus 20:7 NIV) This isn’t just about profanity, it’s about what we assign God’s name to, it’s about wearing the name ‘Christian’ honourably and prioritising the glory and reputation of the one true God (hence the first two commandments). Clever stuff. Challenge time: before checking Exodus 20, try to write down all of the TCs. How did you do? Sneaky hint: they’re all about relationships. More tomorrow…</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.' Exodus 20:8 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever walked a curious toddler through the porcelain section of an expensive shop? And spent the entire time saying, ‘Don’t touch that,’ ‘Mind the lady,’ ‘How about we save that lovely windmill impression for outside?’ That’s kinda like what the Sabbath had become by the time Jesus was around. People had become completely hung up on a huge list of do’s and don’ts. That’s why Jesus said: ‘<em>The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of the people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.</em>’ (Mark 2:27 NLT) The idea of keeping the Sabbath holy was to allow people to rest and allow God to refresh them. But hang on; sometimes we, in this age, can be guilty of not keeping the Sabbath. We find ourselves running about all week, nipping to church on the weekend and hitting the next week faster than you can say: ‘expensive shops are no place for children.’ So, how do we keep it holy? We make time to rest. We slow down and listen out for God. That rest comes by reading His Word, praying, listening to people preach and chatting with other Christians. Only through this stuff will we feel physically and spiritually refreshed. Have a read through this verse again: ‘<em>The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of the people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.</em>’ (Mark 2:27 NLT) Give it a rest and be refreshed.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.' Luke 24:15 NIV</p>
<p>After Jesus’ crucifixion, Cleopas and his friend were on the road that led home to Emmaus. That’s when ‘<em>Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them</em>.’ Their hopes lay buried in a tomb; their belief had turned to doubt. So what did Jesus do? ‘<em>Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</em>’ (Luke 24:27 NLT) Jesus knows that when you’re walking the road of doubt, you need to get His Word into you. When you do, three things happen: (1) <em>Your eyes will be opened</em>. ‘<em>Then their eyes were opened and they recognised Him</em>.’ (Luke 24:31 NLT) There are things you will only see when God shows them to you through His Word. That’s why Bible reading needs to be a priority. (2) <em>Your heart will burn</em>. ‘<em>They said to one another, “Didn’t our heart burn within us as He talked with us?”</em>’ (Luke 24:32 NLT) You’re not always going to feel that raging fire for God. Committing to being in God’s Word means opening it up even when your heart feels, well, cold. But know for sure that when you seek God, you always find Him (Deuteronomy 4:29). (3) <em>Your mouth will open</em>. ‘<em>Then the two told what had happened on the way…</em>’ (Luke 24:35 NIV) Getting to know Jesus will make you want everyone around you to know Him, too. Love–fuelled conversations? Yes please. Pray that God will open your eyes as you go through your day—to see Him and Him at work in your life and in the lives of others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Come to Me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Matthew 11:28 ESV</p>
<p>We’re going to do the overprotective helicopter–parent on you for a moment. Right: <em>Are you eating well? Are you getting enough sleep? Have you exercised recently?</em> Seriously! Taking care of ourselves is really important. When life gets less than wonderful, we can get so caught up in dealing with whatever it is (or burying whatever it is and not dealing with it) that we lose sight of what’s going on around us, or inside us. But how we take care of ourselves affects every other part of our lives. When we let things slip, it makes it harder to deal with other things in life. When Elijah was struggling with depression (check out 1 Kings 19:1–18), an angel appears with food way out in the desert (now that’s some delivery service…) and tells him to ‘<em>get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you</em>.’ (1 Kings 19:7 NIV) That doesn’t just apply to us literally but also figuratively. We have the Word of God, which we can open to find comfort and hope for anything we’re dealing with. It’s been provided for us, but it’s up to us to ‘get up and eat’. The journey of life is just too much for us to not take the time to breathe, be in God’s presence, eat, sleep, get out of the house and go for a walk, etc. If we don’t stop, we’ll busy ourselves into flat–out exhaustion. Is it time for an early night? Spiritual and physical rest are related, you know. Take a ‘sabbath’ evening, with Bible, hot chocolate and duvet. You’ll thank us tomorrow. ‘Goodnight.’</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...always struggling on your behalf in his prayers.' Colossians 4:12 ESV</p>
<p>It’s a normal part of human nature to struggle in prayer. But sometimes, instead of struggling through it, we let the struggles keep us from praying at all. Unfortunately, that’s Satan’s main plan for us: to keep us from God. Our prayers, however much we stumble and struggle through them, can have serious power. Jesus says that if we ‘<em>remain in Him and His words remain in us</em>’ we can ‘<em>ask whatever we wish, and it will be done for us.</em>’ (John 15:7 NIV) But, God is not a cosmic ATM. And prayer is not a punch–in–your–number and hold–out–your–hand kind of deal. We have to let His Spirit fill us with Jesus–desires. And as we read in the Gospels, Jesus’ main desire was to bring honour and glory to His Father (John 15:8, for example). When we pray for God’s awesomeness to be revealed through us/through our situation, He will always honour that (oh, and that does bring good things for us too, btw.) Not only do our prayers have power to change circumstances, they have power to change how we see God. The more time you spend with someone, the easier it is to know their feelings or how they’d respond to certain situations. Our relationship with God works the same. The more time we spend with Him, the easier it is to hear the Holy Spirit when we’re about to mess up, or to notice Him in daily routine. Set aside ‘listen to God’ time today. And, during it, ask Him to help you make a regular time with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Come near to God and He will come near to you.' James 4:8 NIV<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Prayer isn’t necessarily natural to us, because it’s about putting aside our self–sufficiency and our fleshly appetites, and seeking what God wants instead. We can’t wait around until we feel like praying, we’ve just got to do it. Prayer takes discipline. Think of paired ice skating. If the couple only practise when they feel like it, they aren’t going to be particularly in sync. She’ll jump into his arms before he’s there to catch her, and their Olympic careers will be less ‘first–place’ and more ‘face–plant’. Instead, they practise over and over, until they’re so synchronised it’s natural. Our prayer life with God works in the same way. If our goal is to synchronise His desires with ours, we have to struggle through the hard parts of prayer. No matter how busy our schedules are, or how bored we can get, we need to take the time every day to stumble back to it. The good thing is, it won’t always be a struggle. James 4:8 says if we ‘come near to God’, if we practise prayer and really seek Him, He will always come near to us and find us. Of course, even after it’s a regular discipline, there will be days (sometimes even weeks) when it feels lonely, boring or useless. But we have James 4:8 as a promise—when we look for Him, we will find Him. Set an email calendar appointment—pray the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13) every day at the same time for the next week. Use it to springboard into some extra prayer time with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Lord, where do I put my hope?' Psalm 39:7 NLT<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>No one’s life is a bed–of–roses/free–coffee–vouchers/whatever–your–idea–of–perfect–is. So, when we pretend that we’re ok when we’re not, we help to form a mirage of an ideal life. It doesn’t do anything but, well, if we’re honest, inflate our pride a bit. But, despite what our pride–nature wants us to think, we actually can’t get through life and all its discouragements on our own. Proverbs 28:26 NCV says: ‘<em>Those who trust in themselves are foolish</em>.’ We need God, and we need each other. Psalm 48:14 NIV declares: ‘For this God is our God for ever and ever; He will be our guide even to the end.’ This whole Psalm has a lot to teach us about how to deal with discouraging times. The psalmist looks back on how God has already protected the Israelites, and they’re to use that to fuel their faith to believe He will bring them through whatever else will come their way. Wherever we are, God has brought us this far, and He’ll guide us forward if we depend on Him. If you’re dealing with something, talking about it with someone you trust is really important. Yes, God is your number one, always, but He made you to live in community with others. We are meant to support each other— Paul tells us to ‘<em>carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfil the law of Christ.</em>’ (Galatians 6:2 NIV) Pick a coffee shop (or other delicious hangout place). Make a date for the week ahead to talk with someone you can discuss tough stuff with.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.' Psalm 37:23 NKJ<br /><br />Ever been snowboarding or skiing? It’s all about knee–flexibility—the key to dealing with all the unexpected turns on the way. Too rigid, and you lose balance and fall over. Analogy–time… We all have ideas about how we’d like our lives to turn out: go to this uni, or get that job. And it’s perfectly fine (wise, even) to make plans for where we’d like to go or things we’d like to do. But we have to be careful. Head on over to James 4:13–16. (Ouch. James knows how to pack a punch.) James 4:16 NIV says that we ‘<em>boast in our arrogant schemes</em>.’ That’s where the problem lies, when it’s all about me me me, and we hold on so tightly to these plans. A good way to tell if our plans are problematic is if we honestly can’t imagine our lives without them. And of course, a good job or a loving spouse is awesome, but we shouldn’t need them to have a John 10:10 (‘<em>life to the full</em>’) kind of life. And because nothing (but God) is certain, we never know where we’ll end up. We reckon the help for our daily plans is knee–flexibility. We’ve got to be kneeling and praying constantly, to make sure our plans are God’s plans, and that our attitudes and actions are ones He wants us to have. Basically, praying James 4:15 NIV all the time—‘<em>If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that</em>.’ Check in with Jesus. Make ‘Jesus, what do you think of my plans?’ time today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He took bread, blessed and broke it.' Luke 24:30 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>Communion</em>. 1 Corinthians 11:27–29 NIV tells us: ‘<em>whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord... anyone who eats and drinks without recognising the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.</em>’ As potentially terrifying as these verses are, they also teach us a lot about Communion. It has power. Real, huge, power. So: think about what you’re doing. How many times have we taken Communion in a casual manner? The act of ‘breaking bread’ has waaaaay more history and significance than we can put into a half page reading here. So, let’s just focus on one important part: Communion is a time to remember Jesus’ sacrifice—His very real, physically painful sacrifice on the cross. That’s the sacrifice that provides the only way for us to have a relationship with God. Communion is the time when we’re asked to come before the One who offered Himself up, allowed His body to be ripped and broken by human weapons, in order for this hurtful humanity to be saved. It’s the time that Jesus Himself set aside for us to remember (Luke 22:14–20). And let’s not forget what He did, and still does, for us is absolutely world–changing. Literally. When He tore that veil, He tore up all separation between us and God. Because of His sacrifice, God can be with us always. It really is a big deal. Have a little poke around some concordances or Bible commentaries, and learn more about what Communion means.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Make everything according to the pattern I have shown you...' Exodus 25:40 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>More often than not, the best way to make something good is to follow a good pattern. In the Bible, God gives the pattern for living life well. Sometimes these rules can seem ridiculous, considering the culture we currently live in, but God doesn’t give us these patterns to trap us. Actually, they are to free us. We might not see the benefits now (like when we forgive someone who doesn’t even care that they hurt us...) and we might not even see the benefits in this life. But making the decision to follow God’s pattern for our lives is always the right decision. Let’s be honest, ‘you only live once’ isn’t applicable to us as followers of Christ—and what we do in this life matters in the next (Matthew 16:27). Serious (and really difficult and actually impossible to do on our own) stuff. But, breathe a sigh of relief, because the Holy Spirit helps us to follow the pattern in order to produce the fruit of the Spirit: <em>‘love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humility, and self–control</em>.’ (Galatians 5:22–23 GNT) How do we do this? We have to surrender our life–patterns over to Him, choose to obey His Word over what we’re tempted to do and be sensitive to His voice. In return, the Spirit will work in us to follow God’s pattern and reveals Jesus through us. Brilliant. What patterns of anti–God’s–way do you need to let Him burn off to make room for new, Jesus–glorifying fruit? Talk to Him about removing them now.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.' John 13:17 NKJ<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>You’ve probably heard people say that ‘there’s no such thing as a good deed, because everything we do is selfish.’ So, because it feels good to give, even giving things away is just something you do to make ourselves happy? Hmm. Sounds like they have humanity about cornered. Or maybe it’s just a tactical accusation to make us doubt our motives. It’s true that most choices (including giving) have a selfish component. But if we were totally selfish, we’d never give to anyone. Ever. It’s ok to want to be more satisfied than we are right now. That’s good. Christianity isn’t just about uninterested giving. God knows you want to be happy. But what matters is <em>where</em> we try to get that happiness from. God calls us to give our lives up for Him, for others, and, ultimately, for ourselves (Matthew 10:39). Walter Brueggemann pointed out there are three different types of Psalms: ones about orientation (‘I’m happy, everything’s great!’), disorientation (‘Ugh, everything’s suddenly terrible’), and new orientation (‘Woah. I’ve been picked up and put in a new place. God’s... surprised me!’). Flick through the Psalms and find one that suits where you’re at right now. Allow God to change your heart from the inside and be free to act in the way that God wants us to live, and He wants us to be happy. Including when we’re giving. Instead of feeling guilty, enjoy it! And, just like finding the solution to a tricky puzzle, discover that there’s a right, God–built–in way to live that’s deeply satisfying.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'How long must Your servant endure? When will You judge those who persecute me?' Psalm 119:84 NRS<br /><br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /></p>
<p>Many of the songs in the book of Psalms are songs of lament. Songs of being terrified and scrabbling for a way out. Psalm 22:6 NIV says: ‘<em>But I am a worm, and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people</em>.’ Psalm 79:2 GNT says: ‘<em>They left the bodies of your people for the vultures</em>.’ Dark, huh? These Psalms, and the fact that there are so many, are actually a bit of a gift. When you think about it, how often do we try to gloss over our sad faces? With others, with our leaders, with our family—never mind with God. The Psalms face up to the brutality life can throw at us. In hard times, leaders can often tell us to ‘have more faith’. The Psalms don’t. They give us words to speak to God, and they’re not always nice words. ‘God, how could You let this happen? I trusted You, and You failed me.’ Strange to read, especially if we’re used to ‘always be happy’ talk. But you can be bold with God. Cry out, even. Trust that He gets your harsh words, where you’re coming from and that you’re in safe hands. God is still Love, He’s still ‘Almighty God’, and He’s still worthy of your respect (there’s a real difference between ‘be raw with God’ and ‘abuse God’). But He can handle your raw, real feelings. Like yesterday, flick through the Psalms and find one that fits an angry, rage–filled time. Equip yourself with it, for a time when you may need it. Remember, God can handle your disorientation.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'We wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our...Saviour, Jesus Christ.' Titus 2:13 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>In the last two days we’ve seen that Christianity is supposed to give you real happiness (Jesus brings peace for us, with God and with others), and that it is sturdy enough to give you words for times of gut–wrenching pain (the Psalms tell us that our relationship with God is big enough to carry our brokenness). What does this mean for the idea that Christians are supposed to be the happy joyful ones? It reorients it completely. When you’ve been through hurt and had God pick you up out of it, however long it took, you suddenly see what God’s faithfulness really is. If you’re used to thinking that God’s love is all flowers and violin solos, then experiencing pain can push you into cynicism. But, seeing God then step in and take you out of that pain and pull you out of the pit He’s allowed you to be in, can re–teach you about who He is. This re–orientation doesn’t take you back to where, or who, you were before. The gift of His faithfulness to you is not about letting you stay safe, cosy and wrapped in cottonwool. The joy that comes when God pulls you through pain is real and new and all the new possibilities that come with it could not have happened if you hadn’t been through the pain. Go back again to the Psalms. Flick through and pick one that sums up today’s idea of ‘reorientation’ (Psalm 30 is a good one). Keep it, not just for when you need it, but to guide you through every season of your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives.' Ephesians 2:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>Stuff you might already know: Jesus gave His life for you. He died for you to bring you new life. Which is pretty awesome. And it doesn’t stop there. It’s not just an individual thing: ‘<em>Christ…loved the Church and gave Himself for her</em>.’ (Ephesians 5:25 NKJ) His design isn’t that you come to know Him and then carry on with your own thing exactly as before. In case you hadn’t noticed by now, we reckon doing this Church–as–body–in–community thing is really important. Realising who Jesus is and what He’s done for you is the vital first step, but God wants most of the other steps in your life to involve others who know Him: Hebrews 10:25 NIV instructs us to make sure we’re ‘<em>not giving up meeting together.</em>’ Why? Because when we’re together we’re ‘<em>a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit</em>.’ (Ephesians 2:22 NIV) When we’re living our faith with others, we can have confidence that our efforts at being ‘Church’ isn’t a hit–and–miss ordeal. It’s God’s design. Welcoming newbies is important. The idea is to do it in the same way we’ve been accepted by God: ‘<em>Receive one another, just as Christ…received [you]</em>.’ (Romans 15:7 NKJ) And yes, that’s not a piece of cake. It’s probably several coffees, chats and relationship–building conversations later that a never–heard–much–of–Jesus/ isn’t–Church–for–old–people/ new–to–the–faith person will start to see what Church is meant to be. So whether your church life is tightly connected or you’re struggling to fit in, remember this: you’re not designed to do life on your own.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 9:1-11:16; Luke 10:13-24; Ps 28; Pro 5:3-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65500&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Every not–yet–a–Christian person you speak to has a reason why they’re not ready to get to know Jesus. Sometimes, that reason will be a big hurt, not a lack of knowledge about faith. It may be something they feel they can’t help but hold against the Church, or against God Himself—maybe a nasty experience of ‘religion’, or a life experience they blame God for. That’s tricky, and can be a deeply sad situation. It can also be a perfect chance to show the true meaning and heart of Christianity—the love of Jesus. If you’ve met someone like this (or been in this position) before, you’ll know it can’t be fixed over a single cup of coffee. It needs to be a slow, gentle process that’s really all about showing love. That might look like a listening ear, an apology, or even a difficult conversation where you admit you don’t know all the answers.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Easy? No. But, through patience and prayer, God can do some serious work. Keep close to Him, keep open and honest with the hurting person and, slowly, they’ll begin to see God for themselves; not just through you. Don’t think this is relevant to you? One day you’re sure to meet someone in need of this kind of restoration. So, get thinking. And praying. Is there someone who you know has a block sitting between them and getting to know God? Pray that God will begin to show you the right way to help them take the block down.</p>

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ok. So we’ve thought about how people may have been hurt, and how that can put up a block. There’s another big reason people can be put off Christianity: they have a certain idea of how it’ll play out. People see the Church in a million different ways, and some of the ways they see it can be less than inviting. And, by extension, they think the same of Christianity in general: centuries out of date with the real world, full of restrictive rules and weird lingo (<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>splagchnizomai</em>, anyone?), obsessed with emptying your wallet. We know that idea isn’t quite right, but it’s still a real barrier between some people and God.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So what do we do? We think the best thing to do is be honest. Opening up to the fact that the Church is a huge body of believers is a good start, but it also leaves plenty of room for error. Sometimes the preaching is boring. Sometimes the conversation and after–service tea are equally weak. But there’s a flipside: that isn’t what Church is about. Church is about welcoming everyone. Maybe to change someone’s idea of Church, you’ll not only have to be honest about its shortcomings, but confident in the fact that God moves through Christians. What has God done in your life, through the Church or in a personal way? Don’t shy away from sharing it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If we could control our tongues, we...could also control ourselves in every other way.' James 3:2 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The Bible talks a lot about the power of words. And it would know. It’s made of them. Let’s have a look:</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(1) Proverbs 29:20 NKJ says: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Do you see a man hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him</em>.’ Ever been ‘hasty in words’ (or on the receiving end of some)—spoken before you’ve realised what’s coming out of your mouth? Hmm. We all have. And it hurts.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(2) How about Psalm 5:9 NKJ? ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>There is no faithfulness in their mouth…they flatter with their tongue</em>.’ When was the last time you told someone what they wanted to hear, despite it being a complete lie? Being unfaithful in your words can come back to bite.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(3) Finally, Matthew 7:1 NKJ says: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Judge not, that you be not judged</em>.’ Hypocritical judgment starts small. It often starts behind people’s backs. Yup, we’ve all been there.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Alright, so we already know that we shouldn’t lie and speak badly of people. But how seriously do we take that? Words are really, really powerful things. They can change people’s opinions in an instant. And the words that we hear said about us stick with us, sometimes forever. We could all be more careful with what we say. Maybe we don’t go around making a verbal burn book, but we can still hurt people by launching into some sharp sarcasm without thinking or through our quick convenience lies. When you’re about to let negativity slip from your mouth, catch it, flip it and find something positive to say instead. If negative words escape out of your mouth before you can catch them, look straight away for three positive things to say.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil.' Matthew 4:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>It’s the start of His public ministry. Jesus has walked into the desert, guided by the Holy Spirit. No food. No shelter. No friends. Why? He’s deliberately removed Himself from those helpful things in order to grow closer to His Father. But there’s a sly presence in the desert with Him, out to do Him real harm. The devil tempts Jesus to miraculously create His own food, throw Himself off a building and ask for unlimited power. The common factor in these temptations is this: ‘Stop trusting that Your Father cares for you. If God can’t provide food, protection, and purpose, then what’s He good for? Just take it Yourself.’ Jesus’ hunger and fatigue makes it an opportune moment for the enemy to launch an attack on the core of His love for His Father. Jesus (not just fully God, but also fully human, remember…) really could have chosen against His Father. But the immense trust Jesus chose to invest in Father God at this point strengthened Him on His lonely journey to the cross. He was leaving no space for any dangerous half–doubts as to whether His Father might have His back. The trust Jesus had for His Father was demonstrated through 40 tough desert days. Amazingly, we get given this faith as a gift. Where are you tempted to stop trusting that your Father cares for you and take things for yourself? Realise that these are opportunities to get closer to the Father, and turn in trust to Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 16:1-35; John 6:30-40 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65484&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.' James 1:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>It’s a war out there. And the enemy can, and does, use your own moves against you. In yesterday’s story (if you read further in the Bible passage) Satan started mouthing off Scripture against Jesus. God’s own Word used against God. It might seem a bit of a weird strategy, but it’s something that can trip us all up and be used against us. Satan’s attempt to twist God’s powerful Word against God Himself was ingenious. Of course, because Jesus was on to it, He was able to identify the lies. But the attack strategy is still crafty as. How so? The enemy goes after our weak points, sure, but he also attacks our strengths and the things we lean on for support—places where we feel comfortable. Whether it’s your knowledge of the Bible, or some good thing you think you have complete control over (great self discipline, helpful conversations with others, a hobby you love), there’s a real danger to watch out for there. The enemy took Scripture out of context and attacked Jesus with it. Don’t let the enemy take good (even Godly) things out of their right context and use them to attack you. Instead do what Jesus did. The enemy used Scripture, and what did Jesus do? The same. ‘<em>Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the Lord your God.’”</em>’ (Matthew 4:7 NLT) Whatever you’re being tested with, even Scripture, getting to know your Bible better front–to–back will give you the context to spot the enemy’s craftiness.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 16-18; Luke 7:24-35; Ps 107:33-43; Pro 3:27-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65485&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My power works best in weakness.' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Know those times when one thing after another after another after another just seems to be going wrong? You’re not abandoned! Author CS Lewis wrote this in a letter to a good friend on January 20, 1942, at the very height of the Second World War: ‘No amount of falls will really undo us if we keep on picking ourselves up each time. We shall of course be very muddy and tattered children by the time we reach home. But the bathrooms are all ready, the towels put out, and the clean clothes are in the airing cupboard. The only fatal thing is to lose one’s temper and give it up. It is when we notice the dirt that God is most present to us: it is the very sign of His presence.’ CS Lewis knew that when we’re weak, messy and completely unable to save ourselves, then it’s God’s moment—if we let Him. At those times, we learn that He never wants us to have to do life all on our own. And we learn an almost secret truth: God doesn’t like it when we fall over, but He loves it if we turn to Him for help and allow Him to show Himself strong on our behalf. So, if you see one of those ‘ugh everything is going wrong’ Facebook statuses, then it’s time to pray for God to pick that person up from the dirt. Even if—<em>especially</em> if—the person is you. God’s power in your life shows itself most clearly at your point of weakness.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 19-21; Luke 7:36-50; Ps 111; Pro 3:29-30<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65486&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't you know Me...?' John 14:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>You know those awkward moments when you’re about to introduce your best buddy to an old friend— —and suddenly you can’t think of anyone’s name? Today’s verse is involves a similarly embarrassing moment in the friendship of Jesus and His follower and friend, Phillip. Jesus’ conversations, actions, and instructions had always been about showing who God the Father was, and then this little interchange happened:</p>
<p>‘If you know Me, you know My Father,’ said Jesus.</p>
<p>‘Show us your Father, then!’ retorted Phillip.</p>
<p>‘Don’t you know Me…?’</p>
<p>Phillip had missed a crucial part of who Jesus was, even though he’d spent so much time with Him. If you were asked questions like ‘What upsets Jesus?’ or ‘What would He like to see happen most in your family / workplace / college?’ or ‘What makes Him happy?’, what would your answer be? Would you be able to give one that reflected what Jesus would say? Or, like Phillip, maybe you’re still wondering what Jesus is really all about, at the most basic level. If you’re not sure, it’s time to start digging around to see what Jesus really has to say about Himself. The best way to get to do that is, <em>ta–da!</em>, to look in the Bible. God’s desire is always for you to know Him more. If you’ve dropped the habit of reading your Bible, or haven’t had it in a while, why not start reading it each day. SoulFood is here to help you. It’s designed to enable you read through the Bible in easy bite–sized chunks in just one year.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 22-24; Luke 8:1-15; Ps 108; Pro 3:31-32<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65487&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it, but an unthinking person will walk right into it and regret it later.' Proverbs 27:12 GNT<br /><br /><p>Sometimes things just happen that trip you up, whether it’s within your family, your friendship group or something out of the blue. But just like King Solomon in the Bible tells us, we should be prepared for the toast to land butter side down. Ok, ok, he didn’t put it exactly like that but he did tell us days of trouble are inevitable. Why does the Bible record the failures of the greats like Abraham, Moses, Elijah and Peter? To give us hope; to let us know nobody performs flawlessly; to help us believe if they can do it then, by God’s grace, we can too. If you’re walking in God’s path, you’re bound to come across trouble. Satan doesn’t bother to lay traps on the wrong path. It’s when you’re on the right path, you’ll run into the most enemies, the most challenges (and the most adventure). The more we head in the direction God has laid out for us, the more the enemy is going to try and stop us from heading down it. So we need to anticipate trouble and avoid it. God promises that ‘<em>no weapon forged against you will prevail</em>.’ (Isaiah 54:17 NIV) And that’s why we can look ahead—knowing Satan hasn’t got power over the future. God’s got that. If you’re the kind of person who tends to think only in the moment, then pray to God that you develop a ‘trouble–sensor’ so you know ahead of time when to start presenting the problem to God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 25-26; Luke 8:16-25; Ps 120; Pro 3:33-35<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65488&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.' Matthew 5:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Being willing to look past differences; commending people to each other; tactfully steering on–the–edge conversations in a different direction; this is the stuff that a peacemaker should be geared up for. ‘<em>You’ll be called children of God</em>,’ says Jesus about these sorts of people. That’d be a fairly cool thing to be called by someone (and by Jesus Christ, no less.) Hmm. But what if you’re not the peaceable sort, deep down? What if inner turmoil, unresolved issues or a few weighty chips on your shoulder are stopping you from building bridges of peace with other people? A good place to start would be this: do you want to feel anger whenever you think of specific people who get on your nerves, or would you rather be reconciled with them? Are you quite happy to carry on feeling anxious about by them, or would you rather feel at ease even with people who bother you? The bonus about any decision to be a peacemaker is it heightens your own sense of wellbeing. Still God wants you to be a peacemaker for the other person’s sake. Start by asking Him, not for a nice peaceful vibe for yourself, but for genuine patience with especially difficult people. Pray for them and plan ahead as to how you might respond to conflict or argument. Commit to practising peace with them. And, all through the process, keep talking to God about the situation.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 27-29; Luke 8:26-39; Ps 67; Pro 4:1-2<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65489&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace.' Ephesians 1:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the Gospel stories we come across a man called Peter, famous for his brash declarations of love for Jesus, and then skittishly running away from his own words. He was one of Jesus’ disciples and he messed up, big time. Even though he promised he’d always follow Jesus whatever the cost, when it came to the crunch he denied (three times...) that he even knew Him. Dark days. But when Jesus met him after His resurrection He did an amazing thing—He forgave him without hesitation. Then Jesus told him, ‘<em>Follow me</em>.’ God is always willing to forgive you if you repent when you’ve messed up, so that it doesn’t get in the way of your relationship with Him. A mate hurt you? Jesus still forgave Peter even though he had right royally failed Him. Jesus didn’t hold a grudge. Not for Peter, and not for you when you mess up too. ‘<em>In accordance with the riches</em>’ of that grace, make sure you’re not holding grudges against a person. God is not finished with them yet—so should you be? In the meantime, He doesn’t want us grudge–keeping. Can you match that? Before you take communion at church this week, get in touch with someone who you feel you’ve broken off communication with, whether your fault or theirs. Jesus tells us: ‘<em>Leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled...then come and offer your gift</em>.’ (Matthew 5:24 NIV) That’s crystal clear as to what we should do to reconcile with people—so see how this will help with your relationships in general.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 30:1-32:24; Luke 8:40-56; Ps 125; Pro 4:3-4 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65490&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on toward the goal for the prize.' Philippians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>You could spend a day on YouTube looking up videos of people doing stupid things in public who then wished the ground would swallow them up. Never mind stupid public moments—it’s far more painful when we feel that way about our sin. Sometimes we can look back on our lives and still feel ashamed about the stuff we did around people, even though we’ve already been through the process of saying sorry to God and them. We can’t change our past (despite Doctor Who/Marty McFly/all other time travellers) and sometimes our mistakes do have long–term consequences, but God calls us to look forward, not back. We can learn from our mistakes without dwelling on them. That’s what Paul was getting at when he said: ‘…<em>forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead</em>.’ (Philippians 3:13 NIV) So, next time you find yourself looking back, remember that (a) you’ll probably trip over if you’re not looking where you’re going (which would just be another moment to add to that embarrassing fails list) and (b) believers are forgiven. God’s already got your back. Turn and face the future. If you don’t, it’ll be like putting a cup of water on a table, turning your back and trying to pick up the cup with two hands. Pretty tricky, right? But that’s just what it’s like when we try to grasp God’s truth still looking the other way—it’s a mess waiting to happen. So keep yourself pointed in God’s direction: He’s on your side and wants you to look ahead with Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 53:1-12; Acts 8:26-40 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65491&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.' Luke 12:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Why does it seem like God is so against us wanting the good stuff in life? Well, maybe He’s not. Sometimes we get caught up in chasing the stuff that we believe is good, and neglect the real, Godly, ‘good stuff’. Since God made us, He alone knows what can, and will, truly satisfy us. Jesus’ parable in Luke 12:16–21 talks about a guy who goes after all the best stuff (in this case, crops), and thinks if he stores it all up he’ll be fine. But here’s the problem, if we do like this guy did and go filling up our metaphorical barns with crops/clothes/other–delicious–but–worldly–stuff, we leave little room for God (look at verse 21). With no room for God, we push away the offer of salvation and leave no opportunity for Him to fill, renew and change us. We also miss out on sharing the truly good stuff with others. Let’s put it like this: if you had a warehouse full of clothes, you’d have decent threads for a lifetime (especially if you’re not sharing them...) But fill it with God and you’d not only have an abundance of His deep–joy bringing presence, but it’s the sort that only increases when you share Him with others. Having ‘stuff’ isn’t wrong; in fact, God can bless others through it. Open up your barn and have a look at what you have stored there. What has taken the place of God and can be shared with others?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 32:25-33:56; Luke 9:1-17; Ps 134; Pro 4:5-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65492&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Here’s a question: what are you afraid of? Bees, spiders, maybe even just the dark? Here’s an even bigger question: are you afraid of using your God–given abilities? Ouch. That last one might have had more sting than a bee, because it’s often something we struggle with. The ‘but–I’m–not–good–enough’ culture makes its way around the church. A lot of the time we naturally strive to be the best we can be; we love to succeed. But there’s a difference between serving God and striving for ourselves. God isn’t after the world’s view of ‘success’. He’s after a sincere heart and a disciple ready to use their gifts for His glory. 2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV says: <em>‘For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the Earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.</em>’ Wow, sounds pretty big, right? It is. And we don’t get left with a flat–pack and a confusing manual. God encourages us through His Word (the Bible), and we’re told to use our gifts to benefit others and to bring glory to His name (take a look at Romans 12:6–8). So, next time you feel a bit hesitant about your abilities, remember whose strength you’re relying on, and be encouraged to start to use them. Get a wise friend or older Christian to pray with you about the desires and passions God is putting on your heart. Write them down and ask God to use them in the right way as well as take the sting from any anxiety you have. Let go of your fear!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 34-36; Luke 9:18-27; Ps 138; Pro 4:14-17 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65493&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.' Ephesians 5:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Perfect worship, faultless preaching, sinless people and delicious food. Sounds like the perfect church? Yes. Does it exist? No. (And not just because church food normally consists of budget biscuits.) Even though we know the perfect church doesn’t exist, we can still find ourselves complaining about the Church* instead of doing something about it. In Ephesians 5:22–33 we get some pretty direct instructions about our attitude towards the Church. The passage describes Jesus as the head of the Church (Ephesians 5:23) and us as His bride (Ephesians 5:24–25). It’s a pretty picture, but what does it actually mean? It means we should respect and love the Church, being keen to see it grow and develop to become more like what Jesus desires. How does that happen? In verse Ephesians 5:29 we’re reminded that just like our human bodies, the Church needs nourishment—in the form of a real, meaty, Bible–based diet that comes from Christ. It also talks about Jesus caring for the Church, something we should be passionate about too. We need to care about the future of the Church, even when it’s looking more like bride–zilla than wife material. And this change of attitude starts with us!

<introtext><![CDATA['And you are living stones that God is building into His spiritual temple.' 1 Peter 2:5 NLT<br /><br /><p>Right, so we go to church but we are the Church? The Oxford English Dictionary describes ‘church’ as ‘a building used for public Christian worship’. But not everyone will set foot into a church building in their lifetime (some people actively avoid it), so we need to take Church to them. We’re like a motorhome of worship. Which kind of puts today’s verse into a bit more context—being living stones, we can take ‘church’ past the four walls of the building. Great, but do we have the authority and ability to do that? Well, 1 Peter 2:9 NIV describes us as ‘<em>a royal priesthood</em>’ and ‘<em>a holy nation</em>’, which basically means that, having been the recipients of God’s mercy, we’re now accredited trainers (authorised) in God’s love. That’s quite a big deal. What about the ability part, though? Are we strong enough to be Church in the real world? Yep, God’s got that covered too. We’re ‘<em>living stones</em>’ (1 Peter 2:5 NIV) because life’s been breathed into us through the Holy Spirit. Think of that as super–powered Spirit–petrol in the tank. We go out in Christ–led, Spirit–filled power, and we have a pretty amazing example to follow in Jesus, the cornerstone: take a look at Ephesians 2:20. The cornerstone is the first stone set in the foundation of a building. It’s super important, because all other stones are arranged around this particular stone. Ask God how you can be a ‘living stone’ to build the body of Christ—the Church, remembering that Jesus loves His Church.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Titus 1-3; Luke 9:37-45; Ps 145:1-13; Pro 4:20-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65495&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord.' 1 Kings 8:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Have a read of 1 Kings 8:1–21. Let’s set the scene: King Solomon has built this incredible temple. If temples were cars, this one would have been a Ferrari. Having taken seven years to build it, it was worth having a bit of a celebration, so he invited lots of important people to bring the Ark of the Covenant (the holy box with the original stones of the Ten Commandments inside) inside. They put it in the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy room (1 Kings 8:6). And then God showed up. His glory came in a cloud, and He filled the temple (1 Kings 8:10). Pretty cool, but what does it all mean in our modern day Church? It means that, if we want to be people filled with God’s presence (you know, now that we’re the walking, talking temple of the Holy Spirit… see 1 Corinthians 6:19–20) we’ve got to ensure that God takes centre stage in the Church. Not a worship leader or preacher. The Ark of the Covenant was less about the objects it contained and more about the fact it meant that the presence of God was with them. Reminder time: get a bit arty and cut a cloud shape out of some paper, write 1 Corinthians 6:19 (‘<em>Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own.</em>’) on the back and put it in your purse/wallet as a reminder that God’s presence lives in you. You are meant to make a difference wherever you go as you carry God’s glory.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Thess 1-5; Luke 9:46-56; Ps 145:14-21; Pro 4:23-24 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65496&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The many parts make up one whole body.' 1 Corinthians 12:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>So, the Church is a body (Have a read of 1 Corinthians 12:12–31). Heard it before? Well here is some deeper stuff to take note of in that body analogy: (1) <em>We need each other</em>. People can offer stuff you can’t, and you can offer stuff other people need. We need to be inter–dependent (1 Corinthians 12:21–22). (2) <em>Unity is major</em>. This means we need to be willing to work together. It doesn’t mean we have to all like the same stuff or even agree on every topic. (Unity doesn’t mean we should compromise on the essentials of the faith.) (3) <em>All body parts are important</em>. Without ears we can’t hear, but if the whole body were an ear it wouldn’t be a body anymore (1 Corinthians 12:17–20). It would just be one gigantic mutant ear—useless. And weird. (4) <em>We need to be more like a real body</em>. Paul is chatting about stuff that could never happen in a physical body—a foot couldn’t get jealous and wish it was a hand. And yet, in the body of Christ it happens. How do we guard against it? We choose to love the diversity in the Church and we exercise whatever our particular body part is. When we stretch our body and get on with serving we will be growing and strengthening the Church. Individual but working inter–dependently…mutant ear avoided. Think of a three–legged race. It’s a joint effort, right? Just like that, we’ve got to get in step with others in Church and be willing to work together as one body.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 1-4; Luke 9:57-62; Ps 149; Pro 4:25-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65497&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves...' 2 Chronicles 7:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>So, we’ve established that Church is a place for not–perfect people, that you’ve got a part to play, and that it’s all about God. So what about when we get it properly right? How do we keep it up? If a church is doing well, and is full of the glory of God, then the only way it will keep itself from an ego–overload is by passing that glory straight back to Jesus. Yes. All of it. In the book of 2 Chronicles, you’ll find even more about Solomon’s temple. God promised to carry on working with the people (and us) to ‘<em>forgive their sin and heal their land</em>’ (2 Chronicles 7:14 NIV), if we do a very important thing: Get humble. The Hebrew in today’s verse for the word ‘humble’ is <em>kana′</em>, meaning ‘<em>to bring low</em>’. This can be done by prayer, in the first place. The best kind of prayer is supposed to be simple—we can pray when we see or hear about someone. Saying sorry (out loud, not to yourself) and not holding people’s pasts against them are two humility top–ups. Knowing how much God has done on our part already (giving His Son Jesus) is the key to this. That’s what ‘lowering’ yourself looks like (see Hebrews 2:9. Also Philippians 2:7–8.) Humility isn’t just a way to put others first, it’s also a way to protect yourself when things are going really well for you. ‘<em>God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble</em>.’ (James 4:6 NKJ) Today, look for a way to delight in a situation where someone else is being blessed.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 9:1-7; Luke 2:1-7; Matt 4:12-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65498&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord will lift up a standard [shield of defence].' Isaiah 59:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Solomon had some serious confidence in God. Check it out in 2 Chronicles 6:26–31. He’s pretty confident that life won’t be easy for God’s people, so he doesn’t wait around; he brings it before God. Then what? He recognises the need for God’s people to bring everything before God together: ‘<em>When a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel</em>.’ (1 Kings 8:38 NIV) And he trusts that God will keep them close, so that they can ‘…<em>fear you and walk in obedience to you.</em>’ (2 Chronicles 6:31 NIV) Quite a nice little pray–obey–pray cycle there. See, God wants us to rally together with other Christians and pray. Does it grab God’s attention and remind Him to ‘<em>lift up a shield</em>’ (Isaiah 59:19) for you? Not really—God is not ‘forgetful’. But how much stronger and life–impacting can faith be when we remember we’re not alone? Prayer solidifies a higher–than–just–church–friends bond: regardless of what you’re praying for, it’s been a fact through the ages that ‘<em>He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty</em>.’ (Psalm 91:1 NKJ) So, when we dwell in that prayer–place at the same time as others, we’re drawn together under God’s protective shadow. Praying together keeps you vulnerable to each other, protected by God, and your faith is stronger when shared. If your church runs a regular prayer meeting (the chances are good), go along. If there’s not one, why don’t you ask to arrange one? There’s always something to pray about—whether it’s thanks, or prayer in a time of need.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 5-8; Luke 10:1-12; Ps 5; Pro 5:1-2 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65499&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...after you have suffered a while, the God of all grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.' 1 Peter 5:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p>God sees the Church as finished—‘<em>complete in Him</em>.’ (Colossians 2:10 NKJ) The Church is as saved right now as we’ll be when we stand in Heaven. But, yeah, look up the news headlines. Chances are if you scroll enough, the Church will be mentioned in there somewhere, looking as if we’re making gigantic idiots of ourselves. (Sometimes it’s media bias but sometimes we really <em>are</em> being foolish.) Some Christians would rather only think about the Church in its perfected, free–from–sin state, in Heaven. Great. But. Looking only at that understanding of Church takes our eye off the reality of the broken brothers and sisters around us who aren’t perfect, who need our prayers and practical help now. It also stops us looking out for the glorious moments when that perfect Church breaks through into this world, and makes us less keen for the process of a community growing together through the Spirit. ‘<em>We all…beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image…by the Spirit of the Lord</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJ) That’s today, now. The Holy Spirit is at work in Church life every day, in every way (really), moulding us into the image of Jesus. That means we don’t look only to the one–day–will–be perfect Church, or look only at the messy, broken Church as it is today, but look to the Christ at the centre, where all is stillness and He remains the same, being powerful to change us. Give thanks that God loves His Church, right now, just as it is! And pray that the Church can look outward to those who need it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 6:1-21; Matt 4:1-17; Mark 2:18-22; Luke 9:23-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65501&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.' John 6:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you were always wandering off alone at random points in the day, people would slap a label on you pretty fast: loner, likes your own company, drifter, introvert, whatever. They’d be wondering what you were doing. Just as Jesus’ friends wondered about His times alone in the mountains. Was this just a bit of Me–time? What was Jesus doing up before dawn? He’d disappear whenever people wanted something more from Him, like trying to make Him king. Was something else going on? Jesus was away from anyone else on earth, but this wasn’t space for Me–time. It was time to spend with His Father—real time, in real conversation. What was the draw? Along with all the helpful prayer requests that He was probably dropping in, He was also getting back to His source. He was making sure to keep firmly in control of a life that could have been pulled away from His Father by so many distractions. He was grounding it in real experiences of joyful meeting with Him. Can you really have that shared space with God in a way that charges you with joy, launches you into the day with a spring in your step? Yes. Your time with God is not your alone time. You’re sharing it. Make your time with God your well–kept secret. Have a regular early morning space with Him (or if you have that anyway, take it extra slow) and, without making it about you, see if other people notice the difference in you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:17-13:25; Luke 10:25-37; Ps 33:1-12; Pro 5:7-14 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65502&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.' Matthew 5:44 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When the old ‘<em>love your enemies</em>’ verse gets quoted too many times, it becomes easy to ignore. ‘<em>Enemies</em>’ can become a big group that includes the sort of people who lightly tread your personal like/dislike line, not just the people who are more than intolerable and fry your brain when you think about them. Today’s translation of the verse gives it back some of the ‘meat’ it might be missing for you. ‘<em>Those who spitefully use you</em>.’ Mmmh. That’s beyond ‘sort of enemy’ status, that hits some bitter ground. Try thinking of people who make you feel like that. Thinking about people who have hurt you is hard, and it can cause you to take out your anger in other ways—like punching pillows or writing furious blogs. This is a common way we try to ‘get over’ our anger, but it’s scientifically a bit questionable: all it does is reinforce the anger mode in your brain. And now some actual practical help: you can make some gestures of helping and loving people you really dislike, but getting to the place where you can genuinely love your enemies from your heart might mean going through a few stages first. So. Part one of the process. If you’re struggling to get rid of some anger, try this. Just stop. Tell God how angry you are. He’s ok with that. (See, for instance, Psalm 83 where Asaph told God just exactly what he’d like done to His enemies.) Then ask God for help to park up those feelings for the moment, so you get on with your day. Come back tomorrow and we’ll talk more about dealing with this most difficult of problems.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 1-2; Luke 10:38-42; Ps 33:13-22; Pro 5:15-20 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65503&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then the Lord said, &quot;Is it right for you to be angry?&quot;' Jonah 4:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>‘Don’t complain. That attitude isn’t of God. Just rejoice!’ How many times have you heard that, or a variation of that, in church? Anger gets a bad rep in Christian circles. Lots of ‘super–holy’ people see it as just cynicism or bitterness, and not something a good church–goer should be going through. Jonah’s bitterness against a whole city of people nearly took him over the edge, to the point where he could have happily watched that whole community, kids and all, burn to the ground. God waited with Jonah, showing him His patience and wanting him to share in it. So, yes, anger’s not something to dwell on. But it’s so much worse to pretend to be happy and ‘over it’ when you’re actually broiling with anger. Breaking the pattern means taking the anger to God as often as it bubbles up. That way, you can be freed to love your enemies from the heart. Feeling anger isn’t wrong. Letting it take root is. To stop it taking root, though, you have to process it (work through it) and do what it takes to get it out of your system. How? When the feeling rises, know it for what it is—‘this is anger’—without trying to pretend you don’t feel it. Then, examine where it’s coming from—‘is this from a real wrong that’s been done to me? Is my reaction legit?’ —and talk out what caused (not how angry you are) it with a trusted and wise friend.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 3-5; Luke 11:1-13; Ps 36; Pro 5:21-23 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65504&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Warn... those who are out of line.' 1 Thessalonians 5:14 AMP<br /><br /><p>We tend to shy away from confronting others with truth. ‘Why can’t we just sit back and let people get on with whatever they want?’ Answer: ‘We’re all part of the Body of Christ—the Church.’ And the healthier/less distracted we (the parts) are, the more effective we’re likely to be, as a whole Church. See, if we’re saturating ourselves in God–time, getting closer to Him and His will, things that don’t match His will start to stand out. Look up at today’s verse: it’s up to us to call others out when it seems they’re straying. But, how do we do that without: (a) <em>Getting proud of ourselves for not falling into the same trap</em> and/or (b) <em>Going in all–guns–blazing and causing more harm than good</em>? Well, Paul says: ‘…<em>be patient with everyone</em>.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:14 NIV) That way, those we need to confront may be patient with us. And, recognising that sin isn’t a public affair. Jesus tells us to always begin the ‘you’re–a–bit–wrong–there’ process with a private conversation (Matthew 18:15–17). Here it is then: confronting someone if they seem to be straying from God–ideals isn’t a bad shout. But ‘<em>speaking the truth in love</em>’ (Ephesians 4:15) needs care and attention. Not willing to do more than just tell someone off, nor to help them through a rough patch? Might be worth praying about whether you should be the one to approach them. Has God placed people in your life recently to confront you to guide your actions? If so, be grateful. Thank them for it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ps 23; John 10:7-18 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65505&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In everything set them an example...' Titus 2:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Throughout the Gospels, you’ll be able to see that Jesus’ whole life was about showing mankind how to live. The time between Him coming to earth and Him giving His life up to save us wasn’t just ‘filling in’ time; it was when He lived out the perfect way of how to be human. ‘<em>Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves</em>.’ (John 14:11 NIV) Jesus tells us the things He spent His life on earth doing reflected the very nature of God. Whoever was watching Him was being shown a reflection of Love. And, because every action was centred in His being God, there’s proper integrity (Titus 2:7) from one action to the next. Jesus’ integrity is entirely based in the love of God, and that love is in every action. That means that, when He said, ‘<em>Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done</em>’ (Luke 22:42 NIV), He was wholeheartedly admitting that He wasn’t looking forward to being nailed to a cross (understandably). But… He was also saying that He loves us enough (He loves you and me enough), to have the integrity to go through with His Father’s will rather than submit to His own human vulnerability. That’s consistency for you. And that’s our example—love–inspired integrity to do God’s will, over any of our own human fear or dismay. So, follow His example and pray ‘not my will, but Yours’ in your time with God today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 6-7; Luke 11:14-28; Ps 40:1-8; Pro 6:1-5 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65506&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that you may be successful wherever you go.' Joshua 1:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>‘That you may be successful wherever you go’. How lovely. Being a Christian means success in all areas. Win. Go be prosperous in every way. End of reading? Wait! Let’s back this truck up a bit. Grab a Bible. Flick to Joshua 1:7, and read all of it. Right. According to that, true success only stems from following God’s laws carefully and consistently. And if success is defined by obedience to God, then it doesn’t always mean being an Oscar–winning actor/supermodel/wealthy philanthropist. Those who are definitively ‘successful’ in the eyes of the world aren’t necessarily God–defined ‘successful’. Their obedience to God is between them and Him, so only He knows if they, and we, are successful in the real sense of the word. In fact, let’s talk about that. The real sense of the word. The original root of the word ‘success’ comes from the Latin <em>succedere</em>, which means two things—‘to follow after another’ and ‘to ascend, or go up’. That’s pretty much the handiest hint to being successful ever. Think about it. If you’re following someone (Jesus, we hope…), straining upwards towards their standards, growing towards them, ascending, and keeping your eyes aloft, then you’re ‘<em>succedere</em>’–ing. If you’ve made the decision to follow Jesus Christ, you’re successful. By default. You, friend, are already a winner. Regardless of situations, outcomes, or whatever–you–feel–right–now, you are succeeding at life. It may be almost a Christian cliché, but give Romans 8:28 a read. Chew it over, and give it proper consideration.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 8-9; Luke 11:29-44; Ps 40:9-17; Pro 6:6-8 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65507&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Either way, Christ's love controls us.' 2 Corinthians 5:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Paul said, ‘<em>Whatever we do, it’s not for our gain, but because Christ’s love controls us.</em>’ Paul regularly introduces himself as ‘a servant’ for Christ. We’ve often heard it said that ‘God isn’t looking for slaves.’ Well. Maybe He sort of is, but it’s not in the way we think. God isn’t looking for forced labour from vulnerable oppressed workers. The New Testament word <em>doulos</em> is actually a word that we also translate as ‘slave’. It means ‘bondservant’: someone who is bound, tied, to serve someone. Quite a physical description actually. Imagine being tied to your work… or worse, your teacher or your boss. Being ‘bound’ to something doesn’t match our ideals of wanting to be free. It also doesn’t match up with our idea that Jesus has won us freedom, and taken our burdens away. But how about this: What if our response to Jesus doing that amazing work for us was to look Him in the face and say, ‘Thank You Lord! However I can honour You, please let me!’ What if our love for Him, our love for seeing Him given the glory He deserves, would be enough to make us all passionately want to be ‘slaves’ of His Kingdom of freedom? Again, it’s not about forced labour… but our love compelling us? That’s a different matter altogether. First, spend time talking to Jesus about what He’s done for you. Now, if you want a symbolic and prophetic reminder, get a piece of string or ribbon and tie it around your wrist for the day, to remember Who you’re ‘bound’ to, and why.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 10-11; Luke 11:45-54; Ps 53; Pro 6:9-11 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65508&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['No evil shall be allowed to befall you...' Psalm 91:10 ESV<br /><br /><p>How much of our time is spent worrying about stuff that doesn’t matter? What we’re actually doing is giving a situation or a person a high standing they don’t deserve. This leads to the matter getting out of proportion, and occupying a bigger brain–space than it ought to do. As Christians, we have a God–given arsenal of tools for us to stand our ground. We can stand firm against Satan’s schemes, ‘<em>for God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self–discipline.</em>’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NLT) Thing is, we often forget how much God really has our backs. Passages like Psalm 91:10–11 NLT remind us that God is absolutely working for our good—He places angels to guard us from evil: ‘<em>For He orders His angels to protect you wherever you go</em>.’ Not a trace of dictatorship. There is a good type of ‘fear’, though. If God provides for our every need (with angels thrown in, and all), what’s there to be afraid of? The ‘fear of God’ is different. It’s about reverence; it’s about our need to recognise the place that God has in creation—He’s infinitely higher than us. To ‘fear’ Him means to be in awe of His majesty and accept Him as no less than incomparable. Then, everything (including every other fear…) will find its place under Him. So now, take a moment to name one of your fears. Speak it out. Now imagine standing firm against that fear, surrounded by Him and His angels guarding you against that fear. How does it feel? Stand tall—you’re protected from evil.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 12-13; Luke 12:1-12; Ps 58; Pro 6:12-15 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65509&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Hide me in the shadow of Your wings.' Psalm 17:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Take a look at Paul’s words to the Romans: ‘<em>Don’t you realise that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey?...give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.</em>’ (Romans 6:16–19 NLT) This isn’t about making a new ticklist, or to constantly be checking that every single part of us is in perfect shape all the time. It’s about choosing to live with God in charge of our decisions: then He’ll work in us to become more like Him. Which means we have a choice to make: are we going to set our minds/efforts on living with God? But there’s also the other side to it: Choosing to indulge in things that aren’t pleasing to God. Jesus didn’t mince words on this kind of thing. In Matthew 5:28 NIV He says that ‘<em>anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart</em>.’ It doesn’t matter what level you’re operating on, any form of sexual indulgence/ theft/ gossip is not only against God’s will, but dangerous. Yes, we’re at the heavy end of things here, but we all need to get this: if we include not–so–godly decisions in our lifestyle, then we offer the enemy a way to entrap and enslave us. (1) <em>We need to choose God</em>, and (2<em>) We need to </em>‘<em>throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.</em>’ (Hebrews 12:1 NIV) Galatians 5:19–21 is a great place for a spiritual check–up. It’s free. Do it. But here’s the good news: He’s already paid the price—all your mistakes are forgiven already.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 14-15; Luke 12:13-21; Ps 61; Pro 6:16-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65510&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have given you authority ... over all the power of the enemy.' Luke 10:19 ESV<br /><br /><p><em>Spiritual warfare</em>. There’s a spiritual dynamic to life—and some of it isn’t healthy. But God is definitely the boss; Satan only has authority in your life when you give it to him; he has no power over you when your life is ‘<em>hidden in Christ</em>.’ (Colossians 3:3 ESV) If you’ve compromised your cover in some way by walking away from the God who is protecting you, there is still room for repentance. Essentially, this means changing your attitudes (which in turn, changes your actions). Repentance is the key to freedom from all oppression of the enemy. When we choose to get on board with what God wants, we gain access to Christ’s authority: ‘<em>I have given you authority…to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.</em>’ (Luke 10:19 NIV) In Ephesians 6:10–17, Paul compares the kind of protection we get from God to a suit of armour. They’re well worth checking out, but for now we’ll stick to just one: the ‘Sword of the Spirit’. Which Paul writes is ‘<em>the Word of God</em>.’ (Ephesians 6:17 NIV) That’s the one offensive weapon we’ve got—and it’s all that we need. You see, Satan can only trick us if we don’t know the Scriptures; it’s on God’s Word that we will get a peaceful, solid knowledge of our love for Him. Not only is Scripture full of that ‘good stuff’, but it’s paralysing to the forces of evil. You have been given the Word of God to use as part of your spiritual battle—it’s true and it’s living—use it! It will protect you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 16:1-18:15; Luke 12:22-34; Ps 66:1-12; Pro 6:20-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65512&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Keep me from looking at worthless things. Let me live by Your word.' Psalm 119:37 NCV<br /><br /><p>You could apply today’s verse to your time on the internet, watching tv, shopping… (you get the idea). Anything that involves coming across information or images. So what’s the benchmark of ‘worth’? Philippians 4:8 NLT says this: <em>‘Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honourable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable</em>.’ If you find you’re taking in a lot of stuff that’s at odds with what God wants, your mental filter for straining out impurities is under attack. It’s been the same since Adam and Eve. The fact that the Psalmist writes about his battle to keep his mind God–honouring is pretty telling. Put it like this: the world we live in has always gravitated toward selfishness. Even if you disconnect yourself completely from the world of technology or never look at a billboard again, there’ll still always be a reason to guard your mind. The answer’s always been the same too: replace the world’s influence with God’s. <em>‘How I long for Your precepts! Preserve my life in Your righteousness</em>.’ (Psalm 119:40 NIV) What does that look like, then? Actively inviting God to build a guard for your mind through Bible reading and prayer time and teaching podcasts, rather than passively hoping that the world won’t pollute your mind. Is it worth it? Yes. The freedom that comes with looking for what God wants above earthly desires will clear the mind–smog and take you much closer to the fullness God has for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1:3-18; John 6:41-69 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65547&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?' Judges 6:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>You’ll find that as you go on with God, you go through different kinds of ‘seasons’. Often, those seasons follow on logically, and the one prepares you for the next. Sometimes, though, God prompts us to go somewhere/do something that we don’t feel ready for. First reaction? If you’re anything like us, you’ll have been tempted to (a) <em>hide</em>, or (b) <em>talk God out of it</em>. Gideon (in the book of Judges) was the smallest guy in his family and his family was the weakest in his tribe. Yet God used him to lead an army. The thing is, it was an army of 300 that went to war against another army of over 100,000 men. Yikes! Outnumbered by over 300 to 1. It seemed an impossible task, but God declared: ‘<em>I will be with you.</em>’ (Judges 6:16 NIV) That’s all that counts really, isn’t it? One ‘Yes’ from God like that is enough to cancel out all our ‘but what ifs’ and ‘maybes’. If God brings you to the edge of something, even if it’s somewhere unknown and looks like a sharp drop, He’ll bring you through, and show you how it fits your journey with Him. If it looks like God is prodding you in a scary direction, it’ll be for the best. So, don’t let it frighten you into inertia. Do you feel God is calling you to do something that, for you, is really scary? Pray to Him to take care of your next step, then ask Him for His plan so you can take it. Don’t stay static. Gideon up!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 18:16-20:43; Luke 12:35-48; Ps 66:13-20; Pro 6:23-25 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65514&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you didn't think much of yourself, God made you king of Israel...' 1 Samuel 15:17 TLB<br /><br /><p>When Samuel anointed Saul as king, Saul couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t understand why God would choose someone as seemingly unimportant as him to be king. Things were looking really bright—Samuel said, ‘<em>The Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man</em>.’ (1 Samuel 10:6 ESV) Awesome! Yet over time Saul got a bit too comfortable. Gradually, he stopped listening to God, went increasingly his own way and starting making some catastrophic mistakes. Remember that time when you first heard that God chose you to be in His family and Jesus chose to die for you? How amazing was that? How in awe of His Word and His ways were you? Over time though, it can be easy to start to take that relationship with Jesus for granted and to not listen to God so much anymore. The ability to forget is staggering. The most dangerous moment in our life is when we think we can succeed without God. The key is in truly knowing our worth, and why. We need to know how loved we truly are—enough to die for, enough for God to tell us to make a difference in this world. But sometimes we can forget that the valuation of us was God’s, and that ability to make a difference was His gift. The key: humility—knowing our worth because we know the One who values us. So today: here’s an assignment for you! Go for a short walk with God—without your phone! Ask Him to show you what you mean to Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 21-22; Luke 12:49-59; Ps 70; Pro 6:26-28 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65515&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Know that it is near, right at the door.' Matthew 24:33 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you heard of a Bucket List? It’s a list of all the things a person wants to do before they die (or ‘kick the bucket’.) Say a whole group of people, with the ability to carry out world–changing actions, knew their time was nearly up—how would that change what they usually did? Say that group was… drum roll… the Church? The same Jesus who spoke God’s truth to people in Israel 2,000 years ago speaks the same God’s–truth–promise to those of us living as His followers, today and in any age: ‘<em>I am coming soon</em>.’ (Revelation 3:11 NIV) The first Christians really took this seriously. They spread God’s goodness with a ferocious energy, as if they’d had it revealed to them specifically. The truth is, we don’t know when Jesus will return and when this life as we know it will be over. We’re not supposed to (we’re told that the timeframe for His return is something only God knows, and not public knowledge). Which makes every day count. Christians in 2AD, 500AD and 2015AD are all supposed to be asking themselves: Are we ready? Are we living with an eye open to the fact that Jesus is coming back? What differences would you make to your life and those around you? Write your own Bucket List, one inspired by Jesus’ return. Pray into it and see how God helps you tick it off. He has made us to be world–changers.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 1-4; Luke 13:1-17; Ps 77; Pro 6:29 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65516&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go throughout the whole world and preach the Gospel to all people.' Mark 16:15 GNT<br /><br /><p>It’s always good to have someone introduce you to new people. In a nutshell, that is what Jesus asks us to do: introduce people to Him. Our primary call isn’t to ‘bring people to church’, or to turn evangelism into a massive project with no personality or heart. We are, most simply, called to introduce people to this Jesus we know. We just need to be honest and brave, and Jesus will do the hard bit (the ‘heart bit’?...). We hear stories of people going into the deepest parts of the world for God, but there are heaps who don’t know Jesus right here in Australia—they’re in our lecture halls, our offices, our coffee shops, our footy teams. You don’t have to know everything about Christianity or the Bible; you just have to be in love with Jesus. When you have real love for someone, you can’t help mention them naturally in conversation. Oh, and in case you’re wondering, Jesus said, ‘<em>If I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people toward Me</em>.’ (John 12:32 NCV) The work of ‘drawing people toward Him’ belongs to Jesus. He just wants us to make Him visible initially. Is there one person who you’d really like to concentrate on introducing to Jesus? Now, pray that you are able to introduce them to Him in a natural way. After that, it’s Jesus who develops the relationship.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 5-9; Luke 13:18-35; Ps 136:1-12; Pro 6:30-31 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65517&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Encourage one another daily...so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.' Hebrews 3:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sin is a filthy, stinking, rotten liar. That stuff that promises to feel soooo good at the expense of being able to stay close to God, well, it’s bad stuff. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably already got an inkling of that. So why mention it? Because we all have to be continually careful not to fall for the lies. Today’s verse is about the sort of encouragement that stands alongside your Christian brothers and sisters and says, ‘Come on family! We know Who we stand for! I’m with you, don’t give in to that distraction!’ And frankly, from time to time, we all need someone to say it to us. The full verse even includes the phrase ‘...<em>encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today”.</em>..’ (Hebrews 3:13 NIV) The writer’s got a sense of urgency—like the message of solidarity, of support for each other, is really needed, and needed now. We suspect you’ve noticed this already, but your Christ–siblings are surrounded by tasty temptations, right now, that would trap their hearts and turn them to stone, if they give in. God’s prevention plan for this disaster? You, fellow–Christian. Your encouragement could be the lifebuoy that drags someone back from sin. Get on to it now! Who do you know who loves Jesus, and needs to know the arm of a fellow–follower around them ‘<em>whilst it is still called “Today”</em>’? Fire off a message to remind them why they’re a Christian, and that they’re not alone. Quick!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 10-14; Luke 14:1-14; Ps 136:13-26; Pro 6:32-35 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65518&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['David gave his son Solomon the plans for...the temple.' 1 Chronicles 28:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>David was an achiever. His rule and reign of Israel went over pretty well most of the time, he got some nice feedback over the Goliath incident, he wrote a good chunk of what’s called the Psalms, and was described by the Lord as ‘<em>a man after [God’s] own heart</em>.’ (Acts 13:22 NIV) So there’s nothing David couldn’t do, right? Well, oddly, God specified that David wasn’t the man for the job of building His temple. Go read about it in 1 Chronicles 28:6–7. David could have piped up: ‘Actually Lord, how’d You feel about me taking this one? I mean, I’ve got the runs on the board, don’t you think it’s best if I handle this?’ But he didn’t. David knew God better than to try to push his own plans on Him. So what about us? Well, making our own plans isn’t wrong, in fact, it’s positively good. Taking them back to God to get checked out is what makes them best. In 1 Chronicles 28:2 David gets his plan–correction from God, and in verse 20 he gives us a great example of how to handle that correction—with wisdom, grace and love. Is God the lead–planner in your life decisions? And if you get a nudge from Him to change tack, how willing are you to change? The best achievement the Bible describes is a life fully submitted to God. Got plans? For work? For time with mates? Even for this weekend? Great. Now ask God what changes He’d make, and listen out for a response. (Keep your Bible open, He likes to answer with it most times.)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 15-18; Luke 14:15-24; Ps 106:1-23; Pro 7:1-2 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65520&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each one should carry his own load.' Galatians 6:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Galatians 6 starts by telling us to keep watch on ourselves. It’s telling us to step back every now and then and take stock of our life. Know what’s inside you. Learn how to outsmart your own weaknesses. God’s growth plan for you is: ‘<em>We will no longer be immature... We won’t be tossed and blown about... We will not be influenced when people try to trick us... Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ.</em>’ (Ephesians 4:14–15 NLT) Say your life is a backpack you’re lugging up a steep hill. Wouldn’t it be fairly helpful to know what’s in there, and why? If you’re still being defeated by the same habits and hang–ups you struggled with as a new believer, or five years ago, then pause—God wants you to be aware of what’s going on inside you. Search out His help. Instead of always having to be ‘carried’, get on your feet to the place where you can feed yourself spiritually (with the right stuff—Spirit–food that’ll help you grow), pray in faith over your own problems, and make Spirit–led decisions concerning your life. Write down on different bits of paper all the things—spiritual gifts, strong friendships, defining moments, wrong choices—that float around your heart and head. Now start to pack your backpack. What’s worth putting in for the journey? And what’ll just weigh you down? Give some of them to God to deal with if you’re not sure.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 21:1-6; Hosea 6:4-6; Matt 12:1-14 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65521&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.' Galatians 6:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Truth is, you’ll probably need to be lifted and carried for parts of your life—things will get tricky occasionally. But that’s not the long–term plan. Instead of always having to be lifted, God wants you to lift others. Why is it ‘<em>more blessed to give than to receive</em>’ (Acts 20:35 NKJ)? When you give out (of your personal resources, your ability to bless others, your spiritual gifts), you make yourself vulnerable and open to relying on God to make it up to you. God, then, can make it up to you by pouring out everything you need and more, not just enough for your own needs, but just loads left over to give out—joyfully—to others. That’s the cycle. God will give you so much so that you can give away so much. When you’re in a community, and everyone is giving away on a person–to–person level, you’ll all be provided for, and that’s how God has designed things to be. (PS: this currency is God’s, though, and He gives you what He wants for you, not necessarily $500 in an envelope after you double–tithed last week.) When you’re all wrapped up in yourself, you make a pretty small package. It’s when you open up and reach out in love to others that you begin to grow, and that God flows through you big time. So how about this coming weekend, you organise one day around someone else? Spend time just hanging out and, when you do, see if there’s anything you can help them with or pray about with them. You’ll be fulfilling the law of Christ.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 19-22; Luke 14:25-35; Ps 106:24-48; Pro 7:3-5 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65522&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Discretion will preserve you.' Proverbs 2:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There are very few things in the world worth pickling. Pickled onions. Pickled eggs. Pickled pigs’ feet. Ok, we’ll stop there. Today’s proverb says: ‘<em>Discretion will preserve you</em>.’ It’s worth preserving a character of decency and keeping it stored up inside you. Discretion basically means guarding your tongue when it comes to the facts you know about other people—sensitive facts, like: ‘She struggles with hating her family,’ ‘He’s really conscious of his self–esteem,’ ‘He was once a drug addict,’ etc. Divulging what you know about other people’s problems and failures can gain you rapt attention from an uncaring crowd. That may make you feel good momentarily, but afterwards it may have a terrible impact on the relationship. Plus, you get a reputation as a person who can’t be trusted. Not good. You’ve probably said the wrong thing, at the wrong time, to the wrong person, and ended up biting your fist on the way out the door. The good thing is you actually can conserve and preserve good characteristics. Once you’ve started to hold your tongue in one tricky situation, it gets easier the next time, and so on. Sometimes you need a prompt to start acting that way, though. Make sure to not let that prompt be someone’s shock over some accidentally revealed info. As you consider the sensitive things you know about other people that would hurt them if they got out, draw up your own privacy policy. Decide that this is info you won’t share or sell to unnamed third parties. Let your discretion preserve your character.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 4:18-6:33; Luke 15:11-32; Ps 27; Pro 7:10-20 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65524&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you.' Psalm 55:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>Augustine defined sin as ‘humanity turned in upon itself’. Now, you might be pretty confident in yourself. Or, you might be someone who really struggles to accept compliments, who doesn’t really like mirrors (or friends with camera–phones…) and sees no reason why anyone should like you—psst… you’re made in God’s image and He thinks you’re beautiful, by the way. Either way, the problem comes when we look at ourselves (or others) more than we look at God. If we spend more time looking at ourselves (yes, whether out of self–love or self–loathing), we’re taking our eyes off the One who wants to give us the true, objective definition of who we really are. It’s not even about what we think of ourselves: it’s that we do think of ourselves more. Martin Luther said, ‘<em>I</em> have held many things in my hands, and I have lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God’s hands, that I still possess.’ Putting everything, especially ourselves, into God’s hands, is the best and only way to keep our perspective right. So what about those worries? Or about those doubts? Will I be able to keep this up? Will I ever be good enough?<em> ‘Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you.</em>’ (Psalm 55:22 NIV) Today, make a point to walk everywhere with a straight back, chin up. As you walk, mull over where in your life you’re ‘turned in upon yourself’, rather than looking ‘up’ at Jesus’ opinion of you. (Also, it’s good posture…)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 1:1-4:17; Luke 15:1-10; Ps 112; Pro 7:6-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65523&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I cry out to You, O God, but You do not answer.' Job 30:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>‘Lord. Where. Are. You?’ Do you feel like God isn’t answering that prayer? Job felt like it too. ‘<em>I cry out to You, O God, but You do not answer; I stand up, but You merely look at me… When I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness</em>.’ (Job 30:20; 26 NIV) All of us go through times when it feels like God vanished just when we blinked. And when we go looking for Him in all the usual places—prayer, Scripture, worship, church, creation—He seemingly isn’t there. When you’ve been in that place for a while, you meet two old friends for the first time, again. Yourself. And, eventually, God. By recognising that God doesn’t always talk in the same way, you surrender that control over your expectations. Maybe you used to hear from God in a particular way. But then He’s silent. There’s no answer. The change doesn’t mean He has abandoned you. It can mean that you’d started to put Him in a box. You began to rely more on the method than the relationship. And if that’s the case, it’s about waiting on God as He takes you beyond the way it used to be into the heart of a new relationship. There’s a real communication that goes on when you, and God, are silent together. More on that tomorrow, too. If this speaks to you today—stop asking for things to be the way they were. Just for a little while. Plan some prayer times over the next few days that are just about listening out for God. Look for Him to speak to you in an unexpected way.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 7-9; Luke 16:1-18; Ps 135; Pro 7:21-23 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65525&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will bring justice if you will only wait.' Job 35:14 NLT<br /><br /><p><em>Silence isn’t absence</em>. Sometimes God says to you, ‘<em>Be still, and know that I am God</em>.’ (Psalm 46:10 NIV) When God seems silent, He can be giving us a chance to discover Him again in a totally new way. You have to be really secure with somebody to just sit quietly with them. Silence takes the emphasis off words and builds a level of intimacy where they’re no longer necessary. Something changes in your relationship with God when you sit silently with Him. But what if you’re waiting desperately for some answer to prayer? First up, check out the conversation around today’s verse in Job. Second, Charles Trumbull said, ‘God knows when to withhold or grant visible signs of encouragement. It’s good when He sends confirmation, but we grow faster when we’ve trusted Him without it. Those who do, always receive the greatest visible evidence of His love.’ God answers every prayer; it’s just that across some He writes, ‘Just wait.’ It takes as long as it takes—and usually feels uncomfortable the whole time. But there’s good news. Eventually your prayers become less about getting answers and more about realising that you’re with God, and right alongside His long–lasting provision for you, at a deeper level than you imagined. If this reading speaks to you today, well this may seem repetitive (word4U2day said pretty much the same yesterday) but stop asking for things. Just for a little while. Plan some prayer times over the next few days that are just about listening out for God. Look for Him to speak to you in an unexpected way.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 10-12; Luke 16:19-31; Ps 24; Pro 7:24-25 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65526&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['&quot;I am the Lord's servant,&quot; said Mary; &quot;may it happen to me as you have said.&quot;' Luke 1:38 GNT<br /><br /><p>Mary famously gets called to be the mother of Jesus in the story behind today’s verse. Popularly, that story’s called the Annunciation, which is a fancy way of saying ‘<em>the announcement</em>’. God sends an angel to announce to Mary His plans that her life would become a space for Jesus’ arrival into the world. Wow. But nothing happens until she says ‘yes’. It’s a curious one, this. God has determined something is definitely going to happen but still gives Mary the chance to confirm His plan by saying: ‘<em>let it be done to me as you have said</em>.’ That’s key. When have you felt the announcement of God, calling you out from the normal, asking if He can make you more aware of His presence and start working more and more through you? The poem Annunciation by Denise Levertov asks, ‘Aren’t there annunciations of one sort or another in most lives?’ Moments when you feel a dream on your heart especially strongly. Moments when you feel weighted down with darkness. These moments carry opportunity, chance to see the purpose that extends down beneath the surface of your life. So, will you let Him in? Not begrudgingly. Not turning away as if dodging a bullet. Will you be space for the uncontained God, today? Even if you don’t feel a fully spelled–out call of God on your life, know that God can turn anything to His use. Examine your life to see where it is most stressed or most enlivened right now. Are those places you could invite God into?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 13-15; Luke 17:1-19; Ps 26; Pro 7:26-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65527&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.' 2 Corinthians 4:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Look at Jesus’ family tree and notice He’s not descended from the people society admires. His mother got pregnant outside of marriage. (We know the full story of that, of course, but not everyone around her at the time believed it.) This would’ve led to her being seen as ‘undesirable’ in society. But God was using her. In an absolutely huge way. And, look further back in the Bible—God quite often uses the underdog. David and Goliath ring a bell? What this shows us is that God is the one with the power. God never goes for the same type of person over another. He is so far beyond the categories we’d choose (people that impress us, experienced winners, ‘the most likely to succeed’). We are all (and they are all) ‘<em>jars of clay</em>’; we’ve all been made and sculpted by God and are fragile. And He uses us, fragility and all. The treasure we’ve been given is that God is for us. Hands down, He’s for us. Which is kind of a great relief: to know that it’s not up to us; to vindicate ourselves; to make something of ourselves; to be someone worth boasting about; but that God’s already done all the work. Are there any relationships or areas in your life where you aren’t living like God is the one with the power? Take it before God and take courage, as Paul says, ‘<em>What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</em>’ (Romans 8:31 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 5:1-6:16; Rev 11:15-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65528&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['What is the best thing to do in the short life that God has given us? I think we should enjoy eating, drinking, and working hard. This is what God intends for us to do.' Ecclesiastes 5:18 CEV<br /><br /><p>It’s easy to let your eyes drift off what God’s given you and find yourself fixated on someone else’s lot. Surprisingly, God has a lot to say about this idea of contentment with your own lot in life. In fact, the writer of Ecclesiastes lays out how God’s given you opportunities to find joy and let it bubble out of every corner your life, even the dark ones. Ecclesiastes 5:18–20 NKJ says: ‘<em>It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy… for it is his heritage</em>.’ But when you’re struggling to find that contentment and basic happiness in life, there’s a tendency to be envious about what other people’s lives look like. Somebody else’s life suddenly becomes much more appealing and seems all rosy–glow wonderful. This makes us susceptible to extremes in perspective. One myth, the ‘forever myth’, tells you your own situation will never improve. Another, the ‘never myth’, says if things get any worse you’ll never be able to handle them. Both are distortions. Contentment with your life comes from the hands of the God who deals out enough for today. Think over things in your life that you may take for granted: a great friend, listening to music, sports or the taste of your favourite meal. God has made them all for your appreciation; they are signs that He’s with you. If you’re going through some tough times, remember that they’ll pass, and that God’s with you all the way (Isaiah 41:10).</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 16:1 - 18:16; Luke 17:20-37; Ps 115; Pro 8:1-3 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65531&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[dont-run-be-bold]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.' Proverbs 28:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Having a guilty conscience means always running—whether from the people you’ve hurt; from the people who’d be in charge of punishing you; or even (Jonah–style) from God. But today’s verse tells us that running is pretty much pointless, because ‘no one pursues’. When we’re running from guilt, chances are that we’re mostly only running from our own conscience. And, especially because this running is all in our heads, we don’t really get anywhere. We’re far more likely to just implode. So, is there another option? What about the second half of that verse then? ‘<em>The righteous are as bold as lions</em>.’ Actually… That says a lot about God’s power. It says that, when we’re righteous, we’re granted the boldness of the fiercest lion. And here’s even more good news: John 1:12. Yes. <em>‘Yet to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God</em>.’ Because of Jesus, we’re fully adopted into God’s family. That means that, because He chooses to always see us in and through Christ, we’re called, and most importantly enabled, to be righteous. That means that we can all take a firm hold of that boldness. The first step towards that is to focus our whole attention on living out the righteousness we’re offered. So let’s use our righteous–boldness to avoid fleeing in fright. If you feel like there are some mistakes you’re running from (or have run from in the past) do these three things: (1) <em>Worship</em>. Know that you’re righteous, because of Jesus. (2) <em>Own up to the mistake before God.</em> Ask for His healing for it. (3) <em>Own up to the people/person affected</em>. Have any conversations that need to happen.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 18:17-20:21; Luke 18:1-17; Ps 11; Pro 8:4-5 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65532&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.' Psalm 112:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>It’s probably fair to say that we’re most likely to be bold (especially about sharing our faith) when we’re feeling closest to God. So, lesson 1: if you’re a Christian but have made a mess of the whole purity/truthfulness/ kindness/fruit–of–the–Spirit (see Galatians 5:22–23) thing, God won’t reject your ‘sorry’. The past is there to be learnt from, not burnt from. Yet what about when we mess up over and over? Ever done the ‘I promise I won’t do that sin any more’ thing, and then (no matter how long you manage to hold off) you seem to fall back into the habit? Breaking news! God is transforming us ‘<em>from one degree of glory to another</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 NRS) One degree. To another. That implies that you (1) <em>aren’t perfect</em>, and (2) <em>can, with God’s help, get closer to His likeness</em>. Satan loves to reach into whatever dark pit of ‘won’t–go–back–there’ he can find, and drag back up whatever he knows will make you squirm before God. We’ve all been there. Guess what? There is no darkness in your life that Jesus hasn’t forgiven. To bring this back round: don’t sweat that you aren’t perfect. God’s aware of that bit. When you know you’re out of your depth or really struggling, don’t sweat. He’s got you—‘Be still’ and let Him take the strain. God wants you to pray, declare out loud even, the pains that stop you from feeling His closeness and power. Giving these faith–on–hold pains to God gives the enemy no room to operate in your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 21-23; Luke 18:18-43; Ps 19; Pro 8:6-7 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65533&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.' Psalm 84:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>The great boxer Muhammad Ali once said, ‘What keeps me going is goals.’ He’s right; our motivation for doing something is nearly always the prize we receive at the end. Jesus didn’t beat around the bush when He appealed to these desires in us: He promises ‘<em>treasure in Heaven</em>.’ (Matthew 6:20 NIV) But to get the treasure, we’re to live boldly for God here in the world. That means going from strength to strength in our living out of what God asks us to do, here. Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 9:24–27, that we’re to keep our eyes fixed on the prize of where God and His people are—Heaven—and run with all our might toward it. As we live for Him, there are two things that keep us going: joyful remembering and hopeful looking forward. That’s what pilgrims used to do, back in the day when pilgrimages were a popular way of expressing faith in God. A pilgrim is described as: ‘a traveller (literally one who has come from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place. Typically, this is a physical journey, often on foot, to some place of special significance.’ As they travelled they’d be remembering Christ, letting Him be known, and looking forwards. Treat your day like a pilgrimage. As you go about your day, with its ups and downs, remind yourself that you have the sure hope of Heaven. Let that motivate you to do bold, good works for God. And, don’t forget to enjoy your day too—Jesus came that we may have abundant life here on earth too!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 24-25; Luke 19:1-21; Ps 116:1-11; Pro 8:8-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65534&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men.' Ephesians 6:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are two great verses: ‘<em>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men</em>’ (Ephesians 6:7 NIV); and <em>‘I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from My Father I have made known to you</em>.’ (John 15:15 NIV) They give a whole new spin to what service is. When we work to serve God, it becomes more than drudging, low–level service. We’re actually part of some of God’s plans (we’re certainly in on His biggest plan of all—the whole Salvation Plan). And that, in turn, means that Jesus calls us ‘friend’. Hold on a second. Friend. He calls us friend. When we decide to serve Jesus, He doesn’t say, ‘Oh, thanks for that, little minion.’ He says, ‘Bless you, my dear, precious friend.’ The One who’s worked for forever to save us all calls us friend, and not even because of the meagre amount of good that we (might) get done here on earth. It’s purely because, ‘<em>Everything that I learned from My Father, I have made known to you</em>.’ (John 15:15 NIV) So, when we’re told to: ‘Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,’ we’re actually being told to serve as if we’re serving our closest friend, who’s given everything He has to allow us to live truly well. Kind of puts things in perspective, doesn’t it? Do something servant–like for a friend (an earthly one) today. You’ll feel the new spin. Your heart will soar.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hos 1-5; Luke 19:22-40; Ps 116:12-19; Pro 8:10-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65535&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.' James 1:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever thought what would happen if everything you thought came straight out of your mouth? This is what it may sound like: ‘So, this Bible verse is… ooo, a bird! Anyway… What’s for lunch?’ Probably not the most productive. Let’s face it, if we said every single thing that came into our heads, we’d probably look like we had the attention span of a butterfly (and offend almost everyone we met by the end of the day). Proverbs 17:28 says ‘<em>Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues</em>.’ We all have foolish thoughts, and sometimes the smartest thing to do is, well, keep it shut! Not speaking can be great. Jesus was pretty good with His words (He never put His foot in it by speaking too soon), and He was also a great listener. As a result, He attracted people like a magnet in a room full of drawing pins. Doubtless there were times He was tired and didn’t feel like it—but He listened anyway. Listening is often more effective than talking. In fact, there’s a point in every conversation where you need to say less and listen more. It’s only by listening that we can learn. We can never come into deep relationships with those around us unless we listen to what they have to say. Can you think of anyone in your life you don’t listen to enough? Next time you see them, make it your mission to (fully) listen to what they have to say.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hos 6-10; Luke 19:41-20:8; Ps 13; Pro 8:14-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65536&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The... Lord is my strength... He enables me to [go on].' Habakkuk 3:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>When the things the prophet Habakkuk counted on started to crumble, he was forced to discern between what was truly important and what was just ‘here–today–gone–tomorrow’ stuff. We all have to do that at some point. Here’s what Habakkuk said, in the final three verses of his book: ‘<em>Even though the fig trees have no fruit and no grapes grow on the vines, even though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no grain, even though the sheep all die and the cattle stalls are empty, I will still be joyful and glad, because the Lord God is my Saviour. The Sovereign Lord gives me strength. He makes me sure–footed as a deer and keeps me safe on the mountains.</em>’ (Habakkuk 3:17–19 GNT) Habakkuk realised he had no control over certain things. So he chose to control his response. He rejoiced in the Lord regardless of what happened, and drew from God the strength to ‘go on’. What’s your source? The Bible says that ‘<em>the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.</em>’ (2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV) As you read this maybe you could stop and listen as He draws close. May your eyes fix on the eyes of God, who loves, trusts, and wants to strengthen you. Draw close to Him and He will draw close to you (James 4:8). Write down some of the things that are bothering you or stressing you out, talk to Jesus about them and keep your joy. He will help you go on.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 24:17-22; Deut 15:7-11; Matt 5:38-48 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65537&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['A peaceful heart leads to a healthy body, jealousy is like cancer in the bones.' Proverbs 14:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jealousy starts as a seed. It’s the little, fleeting moment when we compare our abilities, appearance, or life–in–general with someone else’s (or with your whole Instagram feed…?) Chances are, when that happens, we probably don’t even recognise it to be the starting seed of jealousy. It’s such an insignificant thing, right? Well, it might look that way. But stick it in a lovely rich fertiliser of our oh–so–human insecurities, and water it with a bit of a desire for self–improvement, and it starts to grow. That tiny seed becomes a green–eyed monster plant of jealousy. Here are a couple of tips to root out the seed before it gets a chance to grow. (1) <em>Contentment</em>: It’s not always easy to decide to be happy whatever our circumstances and uproot those twinges of jealousy. In Philippians 4:10–13, Paul chats about contentment, then says: ‘<em>I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.</em>’ This means asking for help from the Holy Spirit. (2) <em>Community mentality</em>: We’re all on the same team. Let’s call it Team Humanity. When someone else is winning at life, that doesn’t mean you lose. If we’re on the same side, someone else’s happiness should be able to make our side stronger. The cure here is to literally celebrate with them, get in touch and enjoy their good times with them. Jealousy doesn’t have room to breathe when you choose to focus on someone else’s needs, especially someone who you might be a bit envious of. Think of a way to bless them and root out the jealousy seed.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hos 11-14; Luke 20:9-26; Ps 55:1-11; Pro 8:17-18 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65538&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why is this happening to me?' Genesis 25:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>Some of us live waiting for a specific title or courier–delivered letter from God to find out what part we have to play in His Kingdom. But as Christians we have all already been given a role, an identity to take on, an invitation to accept. Understanding this truth makes sense of what God is doing in our lives. In the story behind today’s verse we find Rebekah asking the question, ‘<em>Why is this happening to me?</em>’ She’s carrying twins and the two babies in her womb keep wrestling with each other. She asks God and He tells her that there are two nations within her womb, and that one will serve the other. Why me? Why now? This is so difficult, so uncomfortable, so inconvenient. Have you ever found yourself saying these things? Just as it reassured Rebekah, often just knowing the fact that God’s at work helps us with these ‘Why me?’ moments. It’s easy to forget in the difficulties of the moment but turning to God and developing an awareness of His purpose and His presence makes all the difference. It’s about the direction of your heart, knowing that God’s already been working out His purpose for your life. Before you needed to ask. If the direction of your heart is towards God and the outworking of His will in you, then everything around you changes as you realise He is with you. Bring this question into your situation today: God what are You doing in this? Let me know that You are with me, help me to be aware of Your presence inside whatever I face today. What now, Father?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 1-3; Luke 20:27-47; Ps 55:12-23; Pro 8:19-21 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65539&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The merciful... will be shown mercy.' Matthew 5:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus taught us to pray ‘<em>on earth as it is in Heaven</em>.’ The earth–looking–more–like–Heaven thing seems to be fairly central to His whole message. Jesus’ life was all about bringing the Kingdom of Heaven near. ‘The Kingdom of Heaven’ He spoke about doesn’t mean where we go when we die, but places/ people/ homes/ hearts/ communities right here on earth. And Jesus is all about us advancing that Kingdom, right here, right now. Sounds abstract! What does that ‘advancing’ look like? Truthfully—it looks fairly messy. It probably looks like Christians getting our hands dirty; taking ourselves into the not–so–nice places, places we wouldn’t normally choose to be; it looks like gradual (sometimes difficult) prayerful work, with real, broken, hurting people. And, here’s the curious thing. We often forget that the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13) involves Jesus saying some incredibly challenging words about forgiveness. ‘<em>Forgive us what we owe to You, as we have also forgiven those who owe anything to us</em>.’ (Matthew 6:12 PHPS) So: if we forgive, we’ll be forgiven, if we refuse to forgive, we won’t! Whoops! To be Heaven to others, we need to start and end by forgiving. Surely Jesus’ challenge to us is clear, then? We really should (we absolutely need) to get over our own judgment if we have any hope of being a part of His Kingdom. What’s bugging you now? Are you feeling offended? Whether it’s a person or a group, find a practical way to show forgiveness. Bring the Kingdom of Heaven’s love and mercy down to earth today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 4-6; Luke 21:1-24; Ps 38:1-12; Pro 8:22-23 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65540&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God blesses those who work for peace.' Matthew 5:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Peace feels like an advert for a brand of tea—some hardworking soul arriving home for a soothing cuppa, accompanied by relaxing music and slow–wafting aroma. Most of us crave and deeply appreciate the peace that comes as a break from frantic busyness. But the Bible gives a much bigger picture of peace. It’s not just a calming interlude in the midst of problems. It’s something called ‘<em>Shalom</em>’. <em>Shalom</em> is restoration, making amends, making things good, bringing full well–being. Shalom is the world completed—as it was meant to be. The wholeness of God arriving. It’s not stepping back from the world to take a rest, it’s taking the world by the scruff of the neck and pulling it forwards into what God wants for it. <em>Shalom</em> meaning God re–forging things the way He intended, into real peace. It feels so good to say, ‘Aah, that’s better,’ when you put your feet up after a long day. More satisfying though, is that feeling of peace when you’ve patched up a friendship after an argument, when you’ve gone out of your way to help a needy person, when your family (or any family–like group) sits down together for a meal. It takes work to make peace arrive the way God wants, and it takes some knowledge of what He likes. But <em>Shalom</em> is His worked–for peace that brings a really solid satisfaction. So be Heaven in your world. Be someone who makes peace, who actively works for peace. If there conflict in your family, could you be the one who helps make amends and restores relationships?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 7-9; Luke 21:25-38; Ps 38:13-22; Pro 8:24-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65541&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jesus said something incredible: His disciples would be recognised by their love for each other (John 13:34–35). And He used a special Greek word for love: <em>agape</em>. This distinguishes it from other kinds of love. <em>Agape</em>’s a love that serves, even it isn’t served. A love that gives before it receives. A love that forgives before it is forgiven. It’s a lavish love that goes beyond the love of a parent for a child, beyond the affection of one friend for another, beyond the attraction of a starry–eyed bridal couple. It’s the wildly–outrageous love that comes from God and enables people to overcome their selfish self–centred me–focus and instead give themselves in sacrificial service to strangers. It’s the kind of love that took Jesus to the cross for our sins. It’s the kind of love that enables us to follow Jesus’ command to do good to our enemies, bless those who hate us and pray for those who persecute us. (Matthew 5:44) That way, Jesus goes on to say, ‘<em>you will be acting as true children of your Father in Heaven. For He gives His sunlight to both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</em>’ (Matthew 5:45–48 NLT) What can you do today that shows <em>agape</em>?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 10-13; Luke 22:1-23; Ps 69:1-18; Pro 8:27-29 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65542&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Pastor Andy Stanley says that you don’t need character in order to be a great leader. At first sight this looks plain wrong. When you look into it, it’s obvious. History teaches us that lots of people achieve greatness through lying, cheating, stealing, murdering, slandering and backstabbing their way to the top. Just read 1 and 2 Kings—prime material for a hit TV series. There’s a difference between great leaders and leaders with character. But it’s only the second sort who are actually worth following. Think for a moment about the people who’ve been able to motivate you. Most of us are (hopefully) inspired by people of integrity who’ve gone through suffering with determination, who’ve proved true greatness through overcoming challenges. Jesus is big on that too. Look at His letters to the churches in the first few chapters of Revelation—each one is packed with His shoulder–to–shoulder encouragement to ‘Hold on! Keep in there!’ Each one ends by mentioning the rewards He has planned for people who hang in until they get the victory. That’s what we mean by ‘leaders with character’. If your desire is simply fame, notability or even notoriety, then you’ll avoid learning to serve. But if you want to be one of those leaders who’s worth following, then you should begin to learn the true grit of servanthood. Paul says that Jesus humbled Himself, and in humbling Himself God exalted Him to the highest place (Philippians 2:5–8). Greatness starts as you humble yourself and take on all the ways of a servant. Serve someone today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 14-17; Luke 22:24-53; Ps 69:19-36; Pro 8:30-31 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65543&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself.' Galatians 6:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Ever felt as though you’re ‘above’ some task at church each week? It’s fair to say that we shouldn’t spread ourselves thin and try to be the hero that upholds the church. The point is that if everyone got stuck in, then our church services would run really well. But, why do we even talk about ‘serving’ in church in the first place? Somewhere along the line, in many churches, a committed few do most of the work. If we thought of Church as the ‘meeting of God’s people’, where we’re all coming together, and all playing a part, then instead of our assumption being ‘church is where I go to watch, but there’s no way they’re signing me up for some serving team,’ maybe we’d say ‘I love our church–family meetings, I think serving tea and coffee afterwards might help.’ If that’s already how you roll, great stuff! If you’re used to treating church like a theatre show rather than a family, maybe your definition of ‘fellowship’ and ‘worship’ need a check–up. So that service business then. It’s not just the necessary bit to stop your church’s most faithful bunch from crumpling with exhaustion, it’s also necessary to get you stuck into that larger ‘family’ a bit more. Funny what happens when we ‘serve together for Jesus’. Grab some church friends and chat about the service thing: do we see church more as theatre than family? Then, be the agent of change—ask your church leader where’s best to serve—and get stuck right in and work together.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Matt 21:1-16; Ps 118:19-29 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65544&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Always keep busy working for the Lord.' 1 Corinthians 15:58 CEV<br /><br /><p>Remember yesterday’s reading? Yes? Good. Remember that verse about not trying to feel more ‘important’ than the task at hand? Today we’re going a step further—and we’ll let Paul do the talking for now: ‘…<em>If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ</em>.’ (Galatians 1:10 NIV) Ouch. We’ll be the first to own up. Offering to help out is often met by a ‘You sure?’, followed by our obliging ‘Yes, of course, I’ll make drinks. How many sugars?’ Half an hour later, though, when we aren’t met by a round of ‘thank you’ from all involved, the prospect of service gets a lot bleaker. Yep, when the ‘thank you’ is forgotten, it’s tough to remember we’re doing it for the Lord, not others. Got that? Essentially, we like (love?) being noticed by others. Why’s that, then? Well we, as mistake–prone humans, are partial to being a bit proud of ourselves. And if we aren’t careful, our motivation for ‘doing stuff’ will be whether we get the credit for it or not. There. Said it. Being humble in service requires us to look at God and others more than at ourselves. There. Said that too. Service is about starting small: it’s not easy but, at the end of the day, we’ll have trained ourselves to serve in the shadows when it comes to being ‘<em>trusted with much</em>.’ (Luke 16:10 NIV) Still up for serving at church this week? (No? Huh? See yesterday’s reading.) Why not whip up a batch of home–made cookies for another group who spend time serving? Go onnnn. Dare you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 18-21; Luke 22:54-62; Ps 6; Pro 8:32-33 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65545&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>We’ve been quite service–minded for the last few days, so here’s a final thought. The doing–it bit. Now, we don’t want to give you a guilt trip. Nor do we want to skirt around the edges of what it looks like to take God’s ‘care–for–everyone–regardless’ love to a world that needs it. You see, service (as you might have gathered from the past few readings) is definitely an active thing. But it’s up to each one of us to recognise it for ourselves, and be ready to put our effort in. It’s far too easy to get into such a day–in–day–out routine of predictable, comfortable living that we forget that God is willing to use us in world–shaking ways. The challenge is found here: ‘<em>Whenever we have the opportunity, we have to do what is good</em>.’ (Galatians 6:10 GWT) And sometimes, those (big but seemingly small) opportunities will come when we really aren’t expecting it. We’ve just got to keep an eye out for the opportunities, and a free hand to be able to take them. So, the ‘serve one another’ part of today’s verse is a bigger challenge than meets the eye: it needs us to be ready for that thought–poke from God that could change the course of your day/week/month. Leaving your schedule closed to spontaneous initiative will result in gathering boring, spiritually dry dust. Been meaning to call a friend or help out somewhere for a while? Been procrastinating about getting something worthwhile done? Now’s the time to shake off the dust and do it. You will not regret it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 22-24; Luke 22:63-71; Ps 31; Pro 8:34-36 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65546&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever believes will not act hastily.' Isaiah 28:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Cast your mind way back to primary school. That favourite playground activity: trading things. Especially things that didn’t quite balance out. Ever swapped out a shiny collector’s card/ pack of lollies for someone’s promise of lifelong friendship? Those days are behind us, right? Hmm... We may still be tempted to put God to one side and choose something else. We might be more prone to cheap trade–offs more reminiscent of our school days than we’d first think. The story of Jacob and Esau (check Genesis 25) highlights this pretty well. After a day’s work hunting, Esau wasn’t feeling too perky, and his feelings got the better of him. Then what? Well, his brother Jacob had exactly what he was after: food. ‘<em>What good is the birthright to me?</em>’ (Genesis 25:32 NIV) (Note: a birthright was stunningly important. Essentially a share in the family inheritance.) And in return? ‘<em>Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew.</em>’ (Genesis 25:34 NIV) Bread and bean soup in exchange for the land and livestock that formed the family inheritance! Wow. Perhaps a worse deal than we can see ourselves making. But the question is, how often do we swap out God’s promises of something much better for a cheap, short–lived pleasure? Answer: probably a lot. It’s probably worth a thought–process before making decisions. So when we’re asked to give up something for a momentary gratification, it’s good to ask: ‘Why do I want this? Why am I doing this?’ These are handy questions to ask anytime we’re distracted or tempted. It’ll also help us identify the things of real worth and value them enough not to swap them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 25-27; Luke 23:1-12; Ps 72:1-11; Pro 9:1-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65581&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have rejoiced in Your decrees as much as in riches.' Psalm 119:14 NLT <br /><br /><p>It’s Maundy Thursday. Maundy (from <em>mandatum</em>) means ‘commandment’. It’s the day during Easter week when we remember the Last Supper and Jesus’ command to ‘l<em>ove one another</em>’ as He loves us (John 13:34 NIV). That’s a great place to start acting like today’s Scripture–loving Psalm writer. When we get that the basic principle of love is behind all of God’s laws, we can start to dig deeper into other teachings in Scripture. Paul writes: ‘<em>All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.</em>’ (2 Timothy 3:16 NLT) That means the Bible’s teachings aren’t just helpful things to think about—they’re things we <em><strong>'do'</strong></em> with delight: commandments. Commandments require you to turn good thoughts into good actions. They’re not just words on a page written a couple thousand years ago, they’re alive, still being spoken by God: ‘<em>For the word of God is alive and powerful.

<p>Greek philosopher Aristotle called death the thing to be feared more than everything, because ‘it appears to be the end of everything’. Even as Christians, death’s appearance of ‘the end’ can still be intimidating. The first disciples themselves saw Jesus’ own death as a terrifying, hopeless end to begin with. ‘Good Friday’ is a strange name for remembering that day. Jesus Christ, the Saviour—the Messiah—was crucified, after a false trial and heavy torture. Those disciples wouldn’t have called it ‘good’. And don’t let yourself fall into the trap of seeing this as a fairy story or an unreal legend. In fact, scholars have used historical accounts, and solar and lunar calendars, to work out that Jesus’ crucifixion was likely to have been AD 33, Friday 3rd April… That’s a coincidence for us this year, but maybe it helps bring the important message home: this happened. In a real time, in a real place, our God really died. So why ‘Good’? Maybe it’s helpful that we call today ‘Good Friday’, to keep us from forgetting what God achieved through this death. God dying, when our sin means that it’s really us who deserved to, hits ‘reset’ on our relationship with Him. His death allows us to count our sin–life as dead with Him, and be ‘born again’ into a new life with Him. But that’s not the end. Stick around for Sunday, yeah? Jesus’ death was the universe’s biggest act of reconciliation. Today is a good time to take that up: do you have someone you can offer forgiveness and healing? An ‘enemy’ you can show love to in a practical way? Try it.</p>

<p>‘Easter Saturday’ is a weird time. It’s the middle day, between the sorrow of Good Friday and the joy of Easter Sunday. So we wait, twiddling our thumbs, not even bothering to name this day. But actually, we think it’s really important. The disciples spent ‘Easter Saturday’ grieving. Jesus was dead. Murdered by the authorities they’d hoped He might overthrow. But, a verse we often skip over might give us a wake–up call: ‘<em>graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised…they went into the holy city and appeared to many</em>.’ (Matthew 27:52–53 NKJ) Jesus died, right then and there. Becuase we have the benefit of hindsight, something the disciples didn't have Easter Saturday is a day of impending hope becuase we the resurrection is coming on Sunday.&amp;nbsp;The disciples would see that resurrection is real. But their fear and grief kept their hearts from knowing the hope that Jesus’ own resurrection promises would be fulfilled. Our hearts can live in the same place. Resurrection’s a lovely story, we may even see proof of God’s power, but it <strong><em>'almost'</em></strong> doesn’t seem real enough. We can get on with life without ever fully living in the hope that Jesus offers. We acknowledge that He died for us, but sometimes forget that He rose for us. But... He did rise. For real. We haven’t yet seen what God has planned for us in Heaven, but Jesus beat death, for you to know that His life–giving power is real. He, the prototype, has gone on before us and made the way.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul wrote ‘...<em>if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless... and you are still guilty of your sins. In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost! And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world.</em>’ (1 Corinthians 15:14–19 NLT) Jesus rising from the dead on Easter Sunday is creation–shaking news. God died, God rose again, and beat death, so that you can leave death behind and be reunited to Him, too! Without that, there is no ‘Christianity’. But there’s more. Jesus says, ‘...<em>I am going to prepare a place for you... when everything is ready, I will come and get you</em>...’ (John 14:3–4 NLT) History lesson: when an ancient Israelite marriage was agreed upon, the groom went back to his dad’s house, and built a new home for the bride. When it was finished, he’d collect her, they’d have a wedding, then they’d live there together. Jesus’ words to the disciples set the scene for the ‘Bride’ of Christ (that’s us, His Church) to be reunited to Him. God as Groom, and His people as Bride, paints a wondrous picture of how much He loves us, how close He wants us to be, and what He has planned for us when He comes to take us home. Easter Sunday turns a funeral into a wedding feast. Today, take some time out from the chocolate egg feast to spend with the God who’s preparing a home for you, with Him.</p>

<p><br />The hope we can have because of Jesus’ resurrection isn’t an airy ‘in–an–ideal–world’ hope. Jesus secured our future in Heaven with a promise: ‘…<em>Because I live, you will live also</em>.’ (John 14:19 NKJ) Paul records the amount of witnesses who saw Jesus soon after the resurrection: <em>‘five hundred of His followers at one time</em>’ (1 Corinthians 15:6 NLT) amongst several other instances. Hold up. That’s quite a lot, isn’t it? More than that, these witnesses saw Jesus in the flesh. Not some sort of ghost, or a ‘warm feeling’ in their memory. Jesus’ followers didn’t follow up His death with eulogies; the resurrection changed that. The disciples carried on acting as if He was alive—because something had convinced them He was. Anyone ever who has been convinced and changed by Jesus’ resurrected life has the same hope they had. Heaven is a reality we can look forward to. And more than that, just like the disciples, eternal life with God is something we can start living out right now. Discipleship isn’t a remembrance club, it’s a living walk with a real life God. When Jesus rose on the third day, He proved that sin could no longer come between us and God (Romans 6:18). We’re free. Today, as well as looking back to the world’s greatest sacrifice, let’s look ahead to the fact that our lives, and the lives around us, can change because of it. Does it feel like a while since you last asked God to change something in your life? Maybe you’ve gone back to an old habit. Don’t let anything delay you—invite Him to bring His resurrected life into those parts of you.</p>

<p><br />What if there’s more to staying in tune with God in easy times than meets the eye? Take Samson. If you know one thing about him, it’ll be that he could push a pillar or two. Samson’s enemies tried time and again to discover the secret of his stupendous strength. Time and again, God helped Samson overcome his enemies, even when Samson was disobeying Him. Samson thought God would be with him always, no matter what sin he was involved in. He didn’t realise God was giving him time to repent. In the final (and successful) attempt of Samson’s enemies to take him down, it was his own pride that undid him. ‘<em>“I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!” But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him.</em>’ (Judges 16:20 NIV) Look up the story in Judges 16. Surrounded by enemies and his own fame, he forgot that he had been drawing on God’s strength the whole time. Matthew Henry said, ‘Our minds and memories are like a leaky vessel, they do not, without much care, retain what is poured into them.’ Samson’s story is an extreme, but it illustrates quite a lot. If you’re strong at one point, don’t rely on yourself to keep that up. All good comes from God (James 1:7), and He wants you to move forward, not drift back. If there’s a sin you keep on committing, don’t assume like Samson that God will be with you, regardless. This is the time of His mercy. Don’t knock it back.</p>

<p>If you were offered an access–all–areas tour of the inside of your head, would you take it? For a lot of us, this idea would send us bolting. We know that our restlessness and endless activity is coming from somewhere, but we’re not quite sure where and why. We’re not totally comfortable with being alone with ourselves. Some of us try to escape that feeling of blandness by rushing around all the time, but it doesn’t work. We’re just moving mental shadows. If we’re honest, what we really long for is for God to take our minds, rinse them out in His cool living water, and set them to dry in the warmth of His light. If we’re always rushing to escape our own heads, though, we’ll never be still enough for God to deal with the problem. God wants to fling the shutters open, and let the fresh air of His Holy Spirit blow in over your peace of mind, health, and your closeness to others. Doing more or less won’t be what helps. It starts as He fills your mind and renews your soul in stillness, so you have to be ok with being still for a bit. Today take a minute to simply sit still and receive this blessing: ‘<em>The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.</em>’ (Numbers 6:24–26 NIV) Now spend a moment thinking about someone you could send this blessing to. Text it, Facebook it, Instagram it or just use the old way: speak it.</p>

<p>We know… when you were little, you were going to be President of the Universe. LOL. Unfortunately, you’ve not quite made it yet and, guess what? That’s ok! And, even with your more realistic ambitions—graduating with top marks, getting the perfect job as a steppingstone to that Cosmic Presidency—it’s actually ok you’re not quite there yet either. Yes. You heard it correctly. It’s ok to not meet your own high–as–the–sky expectations. In fact, it’s impossible not to fail at the most important thing of all: pleasing God. Can’t do it. Just. Not. Possible. Sin gets in the way. But there’s hope. In the words of the prophet Jeremiah: ‘<em>Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. The Lord is my portion…therefore I hope in Him</em>.’ (Lamentations 3:22–24 NKJ) What’s that? God doesn’t have any less compassion for us, no matter what we do or don’t achieve? Even better than that, He renews His concern and interest in us every single day. Regardless of what happened yesterday, God is raring to faithfully refresh and provide for you today. He is with you in this new day. He’s already picked you back up. And, once you ask Him to, He’s ready to point you in the right direction for today’s fresh new plans. Give yourself a break. Allow God to renew and refresh you right now. Take the load off yourself and press the ‘Reboot’ button. God’s mercies are new every day—and that’s His promise! Wow, that’s a relief!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Cast all your anxiety on Him.' 1 Peter 5:7 NIV</p>
<p>We’ve been told it many times but when we’re stressed, we don’t really think about it. Here it is again: ‘Cast all your anxiety on Him.’ (1 Peter 5:7 NIV) First, put this verse into context. ‘...<em>be submissive to those who are older... “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.</em>’ (1 Peter 5:5–7 NIV) The verses just before the ‘<em>cast all your anxiety</em>’ bit are about being humble. Seems humility and ‘<em>casting anxiety on the Lord</em>’ are interconnected. Casting anxiety on God starts when we are humble enough to say: ‘God, I can’t handle it alone, I don’t have the strength without You.’ Also, let’s think about that word ‘cast’. It’s what you do with a net when you’re fishing. So, it’s to do with catching stuff. No coincidence that Peter the apostle who’d been a fisherman wrote this. So, when we think about how to ‘cast all [our] anxiety on Him’, it’s about that fishing technique of throwing out and pulling back in. Yes, it’s about casting out worries and drawing God close—catching and pulling in a glimpse of His presence and His peace. And that’s the practicality of 1 Peter 5:7. Use the throwing away of worries to draw in closer to God. Use the high–stress times as a sign that we should step back, and try to catch sight of God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Gospel...of which I, Paul, have become a servant.' Colossians 1:23 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In the early Corinthian Church, certain people were becoming very jealous over their favourite leaders and causing a lot of strife amongst themselves because of it. A whole bunch of people were siding with Paul, ready to argue down the supporters of Apollos or Peter.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But Paul wasn’t having any of it. And he was right. He had a properly balanced opinion of himself, and of those around him. Look at what he said—he was quite happy to say of himself and the other leaders in the church: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God</em>.’ (1 Corinthians 4:1 ESV) He never thought of himself as a superhero of the Church, as superior to anyone. It was because he saw them all, himself included, as servants and stewards of the Gospel. He also wrote: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Ministering servants [not heads of parties] through whom you believed, even as the Lord appointed to each his task</em>.’ (1 Corinthians 3:5 AMP) He and the other leaders were a team, under the orders of God, and so they were all completely equal.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And so are you. Being a Christian, whether that’s the Christian–church–leader or the Christian–who–makes–the–coffee–after–the–service, means you are a servant of God. No more, and no less. Whatever role we’ve been given, it’s clear from Scripture and from the example of His Son Jesus, we are to serve. And in our serving others we are serving God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging.' Romans 12:8 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We all need encouragement. Sometimes life is exhausting and we want to give up. Sometimes the apple of temptation is too shiny and we want to give in. All sorts of people around you may be in very weak places today, under the surface. So, do a beautiful thing today—and encourage. The Bible gives us different ways to do it…</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Encourage through gifts</em>: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>All those about them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with cattle and with valuables…</em>’ (Ezra 1:6 NAS) So begins the story of God’s people pooling together gifts to encourage a group from Judah to rebuild God’s house. Perhaps you know a missionary or someone going on a short term mission trip—encourage them by giving a gift.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Encourage with kind words</em>: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>And he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil…</em>’ (Isaiah 41:7 NAS) A compliment on the quality of somebody’s work goes a very long way. How about complimenting your church leader about the sermon this Sunday?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Encourage through writing</em>: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement</em>.’ (Acts 15:31 ESV) We’ll leave you to figure out your way of doing that. You never know when a humble ‘thanks’ or an honest compliment might just be the thing that keeps somebody going. So, use your imagination. Get creative in how you show your appreciation for someone today. You could make sure your church knows what you appreciate about it. Whether it’s a note or an email (or whatever you like, really), it’s important to point out the good stuff.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them...' Matthew 9:36 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth</em>.’ (1 John 3:18 NIV) Jesus set a pretty strong example, actually. Turns out He didn’t say: ‘Oh go on guys, play nice, please?’ or throw casual platitudes over His shoulder at the homeless and hurting as He passed: ‘Mm, yeah, bless you…’ Jesus was massively concerned about the wounded world He’d stepped into.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So concerned, the Gospel writers had to create a new word to describe that compassion. They said that Jesus was ‘moved in the depths of His gut’ (yep, it’s <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>splagchnizomai</em>, Greek fans) for people. And then there’s the shortest verse in the Bible: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Jesus wept</em>.’ (John 11:35) Ours is a God who, when He stepped into this messy and broken world of ours, chose to heal the sick, feed the hungry and restore outcasts. It turns out they were (and we are...) pretty precious to Him.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, what about the poor and hungry in your city? What if your area has a people–trafficking problem, behind closed doors? What if one Sunday the back row of your church was filled with homeless, (literally) unclean, maybe even alcohol–dependent people who had wandered in to see what your church was like? Do we get stirred up for these precious–to–Jesus people?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Is it time to put your compassion into action, rather than cross the road? Ask at your church about ways to serve in your area.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Faith...if it does not have works, is dead.' James 2:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ever heard the word ‘chuggers’? It’s short for ‘Charity Muggers’, a not very complimentary name for people who stand in the streets stopping passersby, trying to persuade them to sign up and to give money to their cause. Our society doesn’t seem to like ‘chuggers’ very much… But why do they even exist?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Probably because the needs exist, and not enough people are doing/giving enough to fix them. Charities talk about us having ‘donor fatigue’—we’ve seen so many ‘Please, give just $20 a month…’ ads they just don’t have an effect on us anymore.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Contrast that with Mother Theresa, who gave her life to rescuing sick babies and caring for the dying. She said: ‘The biggest disease today isn’t leprosy or cancer. It’s the feeling of being uncared for, unwanted—of being deserted and alone.’ She was asked why she did what she did, and her response? ‘Because Jesus did.’ Hmm.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Of the 1,189 chapters in the Bible, 250 contain the words of the prophets. That’s over 1 in 5. Half of what they say calls out sin and the other half calls out those who see people suffering and do nothing about it. If we call ourselves God’s children—we call ourselves to His action.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Today’s title verse isn’t meant to be a guilt trip, about forcing you to donate regularly to a charity—it’s a reminder that our faith is the sort that has actions partnered with it. If your faith is all words and no action at the moment, you’ll probably find that choosing to serve strengthens your faith. So, if you haven’t yet asked at your church about places to serve, tomorrow would probably be a good opportunity.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for He faced all of the same testings we do...' Hebrews 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Dr Joseph Parker once told his theology students, ‘Preach to the suffering and you will never lack a congregation. There is a broken heart in every pew.’ Have you ever heard a preacher give a message about suffering that ‘moved your gut’? (Yep, that would be <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>splagchnizomai</em> again, folks.) Some of the most powerful preaching we’ve come across has been when the preacher was the most connected to the hurt in the world. And some of the least when the preacher just... wasn’t.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Jesus gets our brokenness. He went looking for the loser, the lost, the lonely—the lowest. He was comfortable around them. He served them naturally, without a ‘mask’ to hide behind. Serving these people did a lot for them. Just like you can make a real difference to those near you.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Newsflash, though: giving’s not a one–way street. It’s good for you! Yep, there are some major benefits to being a giver. Apparently a survey across 44 major universities suggests that giving actually protects your overall health twice as much as aspirin does against heart disease! (Incredible! God has hardwired the human body to be healthiest when we’re expressing gratitude and actually giving to others! Not that that’s why you should give, but it’s nice to know that God’s planned it to be good for us, isn’t it?)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...You need someone to teach you...' Hebrews 5:12 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The end of Hebrews 5 and the beginning of chapter 6 is a bit of a smack–down. The writer of that letter said to his readers that they should really be further on in their understanding of God. It’s pretty blunt: basically saying, ‘Grow up!’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Actually… come to think of it, that’s pretty good advice for all of us. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Surely we don’t need to start all over again with the importance of turning away from evil deeds and placing our faith in God. You don’t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment</em>.’ (Hebrews 6:1–2 NLT) The writer tells us to stop being stuck in a rut with this basic stuff and get on with digging into the meaty principles of following Jesus. Hands up who knows everything there is to know about this Christian life, and about God? Yeah. Thought so. There’s just so much to learn about God and how to live for Him, that we can never say we’re done with learning. Part of being a Christian is being open to absorbing truth that is new to us. That’s why we have sermons in Church. That’s why you’re reading these Bible notes. That’s why there’s a Bible in the first place.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God is eager to pull us deeper into relationship with Him. No matter how much you already know, or don’t know, there is so much for Him to reveal. And, when you devote the time to study Him and ask Him to teach you, He will start to grow you in knowing Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls.' Proverbs 25:28 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Back in ancient times, one of the most effective defences a city could have was whopping great walls around its perimeters. Without those walls, anyone who fancied having a crack at invading could just waltz right in. With them, though, a city had much less chance of being taken over. Walls provided a first line of defence. There’d be trained watchmen stationed on top of them, and the minute they caught sight of an incoming enemy, they’d raise the alarm for the guards to rush to the gates and fight back.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls</em>.’ (Proverbs 25:28 NKJ) So, when we don’t bother with self–control, we leave ourselves wide open to an incoming enemy we wouldn’t want to settle down in the city of our soul. The minute we allow ourselves to do just–that–one–thing–we–know–we–shouldn’t, we start to let our walls down. And once those walls are down, it becomes ever–easier to let one more thing slide. And then another thing. And another. And…</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You get the idea. The bottom line is this: letting something slide, even one tiny little thing, doesn’t work. We may not feel the impact immediately, but even the smallest thing changes the way we think about what’s right. It draws us a step further away from God. And each step further away makes the next one a little easier to take. So ask the Holy Spirit for His help in growing self–control. And then ask for His help in maintaining it and keeping your walls intact.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...What must I do to be saved?' Acts 16:30 NIV</p>
<p>An old lady spent her first flight sitting forwards awkwardly in her chair, elbows firmly on both armrests, looking straight ahead for the whole journey. When the plane landed the passenger next to her asked if she’d enjoyed the flight. ‘It was alright,’ she said, ‘but I didn’t put my whole weight on it...’ The punchline: we do the same thing when we try to get along with God based on our own awesomeness—by working harder, praying longer, having a super–lovely personality, or whatever. There’s no way to do work that Jesus has already done for us. Christianity says we’d never be able to walk with God because all the wrong we’ve done acts as a huge obstacle—one we cannot move ourselves. Sin prevents us from seeking or wanting God. We can’t trust in our own ability to get on God’s good side; we just don’t have that ability, any more than old ladies can cruise at ten thousand metres without putting their full weight on the plane. But God’s done something for you. He loves you. So He took the punishment which you justly deserved, pouring His wrath out fully on Jesus—on the Cross. He did it, and only He did it. And the moment you place your trust in Jesus, His sinlessness is placed in you. You’re flying with something you can lean back into with your full weight, and the full forgiveness of God bearing you up and onward. If you haven’t already put your ‘full weight’ on Jesus, today might be the day to start. See <a href=&quot;Christianity.&quot;>http://word4u2day.com.au/Christianity.</a></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When he died...his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.' Deuteronomy 34:7 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ever heard Christianity described as a race? It’s much less of a sprint, and more of a marathon.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Think of Usain Bolt. His sprint is spectacular. But ask him to keep that speed up for 42 km, though, and he’d end up needing an inhaler and ambulance. It’s impossible to sprint a marathon. Trouble is, so many of us are impressed by the sprinters in church. It’s good to be ‘on fire’ for God (in fact, it’s not only pretty brilliant but what we’re aiming for). But without those steady, do–it–even–when–you–don’t–feel–like–it times of devotion where we let God take the lead, it’s too easy to burn out. There’s nothing wrong with stepping out for God. But Jesus set an example of clocking in regularly for the ‘upward’ God time as well as the ‘outward’ service.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Life is a marathon, not a sprint. King Saul ran like a sprinter. He got out of the blocks well enough but he compromised and ran without God. King David on the other hand, ran marathon style—he waited fifteen years to be crowned King. A lesser athlete would’ve given up years before. Despite his shortcomings (a whole heap of them), the marathon approach meant that, as long as he was heading towards the finish line, there was time to get up again. Ask yourself: do you need to think longer ahead in life than the day or week ahead of you? This is a simple question but it might need lots of mulling–over time.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.' Matthew 6:33 ESV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>American pastor and author Francis Chan uses a piece of rope as an illustration. He holds a piece that stretches the length of a stage and points to the very end which is painted red. The majority of the rope is white and he asks us to imagine this representing eternity. The red part represents our lifetime on earth. The red part is insignificant compared to the white. He suggests that too many of us focus on the small red part of the rope when there is a lifetime of white awaiting us.</p>
<p>Most stuff here comes and goes. And where we invest our time, money and energy has a lot to do with that. Using your resources to bless others is going to have a lasting effect in their lives. Now, we aren’t dead set on having a dig at your shopping habits… but holding back on your next impulse–buy will, frankly, leave more room to give generously. Asking ‘where else could this go?’ can apply to anything: time spent watching TV, scrolling through Facebook; whatever, any ‘non–necessities’. We all need rest. We all need chill–space. But sometimes it helps to toughen up on our habits. It leaves that space open for us to pray about where we can invest. What areas of your life do you need to reassess in view of eternity? It’s helpful to keep this question in mind, at least some of the time: when you’re about to impulse–buy or spend an afternoon in front of Quickflix, ask yourself ‘where else could this go?’</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Forgive as the Lord forgave you.' Colossians 3:13 NIV</p>
<p><br />In 1977 at the age of 14, Sokreaksa Himm saw thirteen members of his family killed by soldiers in the killing fields of Cambodia. Miraculously surviving the massacre, Sokreaksa swore revenge. Years later, after surviving refugee camps and roving death squads, the man became a Christian. Through years of Bible study and prayer, Sokreaksa was able to let go of his hatred and desire for revenge. Through the act of letting go in his heart, he found peace. He describes years of fantasising about torturing his family’s killers. The pain became like a prison that trapped him. Forgiveness unlocked his cell. In time, forgiveness opened up channels for the holy power of wholeness and healing. In the years that followed, he developed a new mission; to find and forgive the killers face to face. Eventually he tracked down two of the soldiers in the very village where the murder had happened. God gave him the strength to shake their hands.</p>
<p>We can learn from this story. Forgiveness isn’t instant—it’s a process. Forgiveness brings you the healing from pain. Forgiveness enables you to do things you never dreamed possible. You’ll survive if you hold grudges against others, you’ll get by—but only just. Forgive them and you’ll thrive. ‘Don’t repay evil for evil. Don’t retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and He will bless you for it.’ (1 Peter 3:9 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['That they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might...find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.' Acts 17:27 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In the years before Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Herod had become increasingly unsure of the threats to his throne. He’d had three of his sons executed on a bare sniff of treason, as well as one of his wives. So, when a bunch of weary travel–stained wise men turned up looking for a baby born to be ‘King of the Jews’, it was more of a nuisance than a crisis. Herod had dealt with much more menacing problems. So long as no one got to hear about this Baby, it’d be business as usual.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Fast forward two thousand and fourteen years, give or take a few. Herod’s policy is still in play. The Baby born to be King can’t be mentioned in many classrooms. Songs that celebrate His name are deemed too controversial for airplay. Instead there are jingles about a red–clad rotund man who encourages people to wish each other ‘Happy holidays’. Semi-clad women dancing to the songs of misogynistic men are deemed a better form of entertainment than the old, old story about the coming of the Prince of Peace.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But God cannot be silenced—back in Herod’s day or now. No matter how many innocents Herod slaughtered, no matter how many nails his successors ordered hammered into a splintered cross, a new King reigns forever.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Do you know of a mate or two celebrating Christmas without knowing about Christ? Got friends who know about Santa but not the real reason for the season? Send them a text asking them how much they know about Jesus and open yourself up for discussion.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search the Scriptures, for...these are they which testify of Me.' John 5:39 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Not too many people recognised Jesus as the Son of God when He was born. In fact, only a few unnamed shepherds, some equally–anonymous wise men, an old bloke named Simeon and an old woman named Anna seemed to realise. Maybe a dozen all up. Yet, there was enough Scripture flying around at the time definitely pointing to Jesus as the Messiah. Simeon and Anna sussed the truth—so, why did most people miss Him?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Some had buried their heads in Scripture—but were too busy to go ten kilometres from Jerusalem to Bethlehem to check out a manger.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Now, the study of Scripture is absolutely necessary to a relationship with God. It’s one of the healthiest things in life. Don’t think anything different. The unhealthy thing is when you replace living out the Bible with more and more world–ignoring study. When you have more of a relationship with the words than with the Word of life Himself.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Bible reading only works as a part of a wider life. As they say: recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. We have to use Bible study as one tool in a tool–belt. It should be right there alongside prayer, listening to God’s Spirit, and action. We really need to know Scripture inside out (after all, that’s where those prophecies about Jesus were that most people missed). But we need to keep our eyes open for real–life God–action alongside that.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The message...did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith...' Hebrews 4:2 AMP<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Catalysts make things happen. Alka–Seltzer without water has no fizz, flour without yeast produces no bread. Faith is the catalyst in your life. Without it, religion is dry. Talking about the Israelites, Paul said, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>When the good news of deliverance…came to them…the message…did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith.</em>’ So: let’s mix it up.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Without faith, reading your Bible turns into intellectual curiosity; sermons become something to critique rather than inspire; church becomes a social club rather than a place of worship. There are no prizes for memorising verses or hymns—unless you use them as stepping stones to action. Faith requires you to move. There’s a difference between what you believe and what you trust. You may believe that a chair can hold you but never sit down; only when you put your full weight on it are you demonstrating trust. Faith is the catalyst to action.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>A gold medal requires you to win. The Booker prize requires you to write. An Oscar requires you to make great movies. If you want to see examples of God’s Kingdom coming in and around your life, faith requires action. Do you sense God is calling you to something that feels ‘out there’? Maybe sharing your faith in class or at work, signing up for that mission opportunity, preaching or leading worship for the first time? Get some support. Go for it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...After waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.' Hebrews 6:15 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>What exactly is our part in waiting? Do you wait until God arranges the clouds in the sky to spell ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>NOW</em>!’? Do you take the initiative and expect God to bless your efforts?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Put yourself in Abraham’s shoes. He’d been waiting ten years for the promise made to him—to become ‘a father of many nations’. By now, he was starting to wonder. Perhaps the word was meant poetically—maybe he was going to be a father in a spiritual sense rather than a biological one? Maybe he’d imagined the whole thing. Or maybe he was supposed to take matters into his own hands. Sarah was too old to bear children—you hardly need a degree in biology to see that—so maybe he was supposed to shop around for a surrogate?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Waiting can play terrible tricks on the mind. Abraham would have to wait twenty–four years before seeing the first glimpse of a promise. Even then, one boy hardly made him a father of nations. And yet here we are—thousands of years later—and we know Abraham as the father of our faith (Romans 4:11).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Waiting is difficult because it means we have little control of the future. And let’s face it, we can tend towards a bit of control–freak at times. But God says: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>You need to persevere, so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised</em>.’ (Hebrews 10:36 NIV)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It is said that often the waiting is more important than the receiving. So if you’re waiting on God for a promise fulfilled—it’d be a good idea to keep a journal to track how you’ve developed in the process.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... their eyes were opened and they recognised Him...' Luke 24:31 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Sometimes, when we’re too busy staring at screens, updating our statuses, consuming what’s in front of us—we miss something greater. God is willing to teach us more about Himself, and to give us amazing opportunities. But it isn’t enough just to ‘get by’ and hope that we’ll find ourselves walking on the clouds all of a sudden.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Looking up to God is how we really ‘see’ things as they are, despite the fact that life often goes on in its usual fashion all around us. It’s a massive deal. And we aren’t just talking about putting life as a whole into perspective or looking at the bigger picture (although focussing on God helps that, too).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Looking to God can set you up for some life–changing moments. Forty years before God’s people entered the promised land, Moses saw it— ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt. He was not afraid of the king. Moses kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the One who is invisible.</em>’ (Hebrews 11:27 NLT) Why? He trusted God. Jesus spent most of His life on earth not being recognised for who He was—people just didn’t ‘see’ it. In Mark 10:46–52 he met a man born blind. A man who had to beg to earn money, who couldn’t see the ground he sat on, but who recognised Jesus as the long–awaited Messiah. That’s a great reminder for us all to look up and see God, and not down at our earthly circumstances. So, ask God to open your eyes to the awe and wonder all around you and to what He is doing in your world today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Remove the obstacles out of the way.' Isaiah 57:14 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Running a marathon is just too easy these days—right? Yeah, we thought so, too. Alongside the more traditional road races, a new breed of adrenaline–pumping running challenges are springing up all over the world. Take the ‘Spartan Race’ for example. As well as a steep and arduous course, the Spartan chucks in an extra challenge: obstacles.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And not just any obstacles. On the Spartan, you’ll find yourself swimming through mud, scaling craggy walls, crawling under barbed wire, heaving tractor tyres and hurling javelins. Nice. Not.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Very few of us are up for this kind of competition. Yet surprisingly, we probably scrabble through life doing a Spartan without realising. Yup. We can put up, invite in, and stubbornly leave emotional and spiritual obstacles in our way that stop us from really running ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>with endurance the race that is set before us.</em>’ (Hebrews 12:1 NLT)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Perhaps during this edition of <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>word4U2day</em>, you’ve already been reminded of an obstacle that stops you from getting close to God. Holding on to such an obstacle will only lead to more hurt and less freedom. We’re not asking to you to try to be perfect, but rather to turn your imperfections over to God. So, be real with Him. Share your thoughts with Him. Turn around and thank Him for His ability to undo any tricky situation you find yourself in.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A good man leaves an inheritance...' Proverbs 13:22 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘Legacy’: a gift handed down from the past. Ok, this is not about getting; it’s about giving. About a question that hangs invisibly over each of our lives: what kind of legacy do I want to leave behind? What am I going to contribute to society to make it a better place after I’m gone? Just what kind of world do I want my kids, or whoever comes after me, to be living in?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You’ve probably never given this a thought. Our current culture of rampant consumerism doesn’t encourage you to think this way: the idea our culture promotes is that life is all about you in the now, you in the thrill of the new, you in the very midst of the experience you can enjoy right here, right now.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The Bible stops us in our tracks and makes us ask: am I here to consume or here to leave a legacy? God is a God of the long view. He doesn’t set us up for the quick win: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Whoever believes will not be in haste</em>.’ (Isaiah 28:16 ESV)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Whatever stage in your education/work/life you are in right now, and whatever opportunities are floating around you, here’s a challenge as we move into a new year: <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Are you going to take every chance in your life for yourself, without thinking of others, or leave a legacy that will advance the Kingdom of God and peace, justice, mercy and truth with it?</em> If you’re thinking about a New Year’s resolution for tomorrow, perhaps it should revolve around the bigger picture than just your personal goals for 2015. Now’s the time to talk to God about legacy planning.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...And the Lord added to the church daily.' Acts 2:47 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>As the New Year begins, let’s think back to the beginnings of the church.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>What started as an apprenticeship group around Jesus has spread to the four corners of the globe, taking root in many and varied cultures and in many and varied languages. Churches meet in homes, stadiums, in secret, in public spaces; some are loud, some are quiet… Globally, around two billion people make up the worldwide Church family. Reports suggest more people are becoming Christians today than at any other point in human history, even though the Bible has only been translated into 500 of the 7000 languages in the world.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>How did this begin? Well, with just the first disciples. They believed in Jesus, not just as the One sent to redeem the world but as their personal Saviour. Jesus told a parable of a great banquet. The master of the house wanted his table full: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Then the master told his servant, “Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.”</em>’ (Luke 14:23 NIV) God loves for people to ‘come in’ to His family. His heart is for those of us who know what being a part of it is like to share it with others.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>A New Year challenge: what ways can you, as part of the Church, do more this year to urge people to ‘come in’ and discover God’s great banquet for themselves?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.' Hosea 4:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The first Church grew in a world without smartphones, social media, TV or even magazines. So how did it spread? Simply by people passing on the truth about Jesus to other people. They would write letters (like Paul writing to Christians in Rome or Corinth). But more often they would just spend time showing people how to live for God in word and action.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The first Christians didn’t cling onto the truth like a gift to be hidden, so they didn’t lose it. As vital as it is, they were ready to give it away to anyone who would listen. They travelled as far and as wide as they could, passing on the world–shakingly Good News. Those first disciples have long gone, but the fearless Spirit that drove them lives on. Now it’s our turn to pass on the knowledge—the truth we have learnt about Jesus.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Contrary to what you might be thinking, you don’t need to be a theology hero for this. Acts 1:8 says that God is asking each one of us to be a ‘witness’. The job of a witness is simply to say what they’ve seen, what they have experienced. So don’t worry if you’re not an expert, don’t worry about making a mistake, just tell it like it is.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Passion is infectious. Passion helps pass on knowledge. Probably a fair few of us chose to live for God because of a passionate Christian youth leader, friend or family member in our lives. Be the most passionate, enthusiastic follower of Jesus you can be, and other people will catch that passion too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.' Acts 4:31 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It turns out cars don’t work so well with empty fuel tanks. Sometimes God asks us to do things that really stretch and challenge us, but He always provides fuel for the task.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The first Christians were tasked with something quite huge: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Go, then, to all peoples everywhere and make them My disciples.</em>’ (Matthew 28:19 GNT) But whilst Jesus was still physically with His disciples He said that He would not abandon them like orphans but would send someone to comfort, counsel and encourage them, as well as remind them of everything He said and did. That ‘someone’ is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The Holy Spirit is available to all people. He is a source of power, of peace, of God’s presence, of authority, confidence, faith. He is the greatest counsellor, the best encourager, the most gracious comforter. If you’re ever in a difficult situation, you only have to ask and He gives you the words to say. More than this, like a dynamo, the Holy Spirit doesn’t just give us that first moment of belief that allowed us to see Jesus, but He works through us, on and on, giving us the motion to keep believing, even when times get tough.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The Holy Spirit is the dynamic power of God available to all people who simply say, ‘God, please come and fill me!’ At the end of our prayers we often say AMEN. This word is more than a religious full stop. It’s one of the oldest words in human language, and means ‘let it be’, ‘I agree’, or our favourite, ‘bring it on!’ So today pray, ‘God fill me with your Holy Spirit. Bring it on!’</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The new wine is found in the cluster...' Isaiah 65:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;>Jesus’ first miracle was turning water into wine at a wedding reception. He loved spending time with people at huge get–togethers. So He didn’t have the best reputation with the Pharisees: they called him a ‘friend of sinners’. Problem is, there aren’t many people (in fact any, except for Jesus Himself), who aren’t ‘sinners’, left to their own devices. And that includes people inside the Church, too. Christianity is best done with others—and none of those others is perfect. (We hope this doesn’t come as a surprise, but you are one of the ‘others’ to someone!)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;>The fact the Church is designed as a community is a strength. Church should be a community marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control (in case you didn’t spot it, this is from Galatians 5:22–23, the Fruit of the Spirit).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;>There’s a challenge in today’s reading. Something for any of us who go to church every week (good habit!) Are we adding to the generous, inclusive, welcoming atmosphere that makes the Church a breath of fresh air? ‘Out there’ in the world, it’s all too easy to find that most people have layers of pretence that cover up their real selves. So, when the Church makes room for people to be real, it’s on to something. It’s time to do our bit.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will reward each person according to what he has done.' Matthew 16:27 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, we like our faith to be clear. And one thing we hope you can see clear as daylight is this: choosing to believe in Jesus is life–saving. And life–changing. And that’s non–negotiable. Paul tells it to us straight in Romans 8:37–39. Read it and let it sink in: ‘…<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future</em>’ are going to prevent Jesus from holding out His nail–pierced hand for you to reach.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘Oh, so that’s it then?’ you might think. ‘Don’t my selfless acts count for anything?’ Well, first up: be careful. Make sure your self–sacrifice isn’t a secret longing for recognition or that you’re hiding a selfish motive. We all have to be on guard: being a ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>cheerful giver</em>’ (2 Corinthians 9:7) means you shouldn’t be checking your inbox every hour for a ‘thanx’ from the struggling person you sent a gift.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But, at the same time, it’s true there are things that count toward your eternal ‘reward’. Your God–inspired acts of kindness. That encouragement/gift may never come back round to you, but look at today’s verse—God sees it all. He’s got you. And money/success/fame? They are, at their best, a means of making God known to the world. They won’t be coming with us to Heaven, so treat them that way, too. Don’t prioritise them over serving others for God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The humble...retain honour.' Proverbs 29:23 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The first lie ever told was one that appealed directly to our oh–so–human sense of pride. Satan told Adam and Eve that, if they ate the fruit that God had told them not to, they definitely wouldn’t die. He said they’d become just like God instead (that’s in Genesis 3, by the way). That lie was a lie of power, and of status and, well, Adam and Eve bought it. A lot of people would have done the same; after all, we’re mostly inclined to follow our own egos. That’s why Satan hasn’t had to update that particular battle tactic since Eden. He still tells us lies about ourselves, to try and get the upper hand. Whether they’re lies that flatter our ego and make us think we’re so much better than everyone else, or lies that lead us to believe we’re losers compared to everyone else, Satan tries to make us forget God’s truth about us. And that’s so not healthy. The only way we can have a really, truly good view of ourselves is if that view comes from God. In the Psalms, David talks about being ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>fearfully and wonderfully made</em>’ (Psalm 139:14 NIV), and that’s exactly right. We are wonderful. YOU are wonderful, because God made you. And, because God made you, you are HIS. Every human being is unique, and equal. No better, and no worse, than anyone else. Let’s start to live like it!</p>

When he returned to school he looked no different to any of the others. The paper carried a picture of these bald–headed students, with the headline, ‘Everything we do; we do together.’ That’s the ‘law of love’ Jesus talks about: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>A new command I give you: Love one another</em>.’ Even when it stings a bit.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>People live by many laws. There’s the ‘law of revenge’ which says, ‘You hurt me; I hurt you harder.’ There’s the ‘law of balance’ which asks ‘an eye for an eye.’ But Jesus’ system storms the law court. It goes against our feelings. It’s a system that asks to turn a cheek and walk an extra mile. It’s the kind of justice that offers to love the enemy or pray for the persecutor. The law of love means you don’t have to get even; you can forgive. It isn’t weak or a walk–over; it’s strong enough to put others first and it chooses to withhold the punch.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>1 Corinthians 13: 4–7 NLT says it well: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful</em>…’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Focus on one part of this ‘love check–list’. What needs brushing up on? Hone in on one part of it, and bring it to life for someone who needs it today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Above all, clothe yourselves with love...' Colossians 3:14 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Is it possible a 2015 application of the Good Samaritan might look a bit like this?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>A man was attacked by thugs. A pastor saw him and crossed the road, leaving him for dead. A bunch of other folk saw him and crossed the road. But then this random church–goer came, saw and took pity on the man. He stooped down, tucked a Gospel tract into the man’s pocket and went to leave. The critically–injured man was barely conscious but held out a hand for help. The church–goer stopped and was filled with pity. So he carefully took the man through the booklet and pointed him towards some helpful resources online. Finally he invited the dying man to a church service the following Sunday. Then he left. He was disappointed that the man never showed up (being, as he was, otherwise engaged in the ICU unit of the hospital with stab wounds.)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The modern church places great emphasis on getting people into church meetings and courses. We promote prayer and study and fellowship. Not that these are bad things, but what about love? Jesus never said, ‘And they will know you by your extensive knowledge and inerrant doctrine.’ His emphasis was on demonstrating love. Clearly the wounded man needed bandaging and medical help. William Booth who founded the Salvation Army is just one of many followers of Jesus who believed in feeding and caring for the person as well as giving them the Good News—because it is part of the Good News. Be alert this week to ways you can care for others. Trust that doing good will lead to opportunities to share the Gospel in a meaningful way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You are members of God's family.' Ephesians 2:19 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Working out differences with others helps to mature us in our faith. Arguments give us the chance to learn. Even disagreements can be an occasion to celebrate diversity. Some difficult stuff can be a chance to take a humble step back and ‘turn the other cheek’. Yes, we certainly wouldn’t advise you to go looking for ways to fall out or get stabbed in the back, but when we bring these things before God in prayer, He can really use them for our good.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Years ago, people would huddle together round a television or a record player. But technology now is geared to our own personal, even private, entertainment experience. Life can become like that too—so walled–off and private that we no longer feel we need others so much. Community, though, breaks down our walls. We come face to face with what we dislike in others and in ourselves. Working through disagreements can show us how to respect other peoples’ personalities—yes, don’t seek out arguments, but don’t necessarily run from ‘healthy debates’ when they flare up. God lives in community (Father, Spirit, Son) and, made in His image, we were made for community too. So make sure you aren’t going it alone and meet regularly with other Christians.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And if you’re stuck in an argument you can’t get out of, give it a rest for a bit. Stop thinking about what the other person has said, and think about where you could sensibly and generously give ground.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If you suffer for doing good ... this is commendable...' 1 Peter 2:20 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will… stamp on my heart with lead boots.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So how do you just get on with your life with a size ten studded footprint in your soul? Well, let’s take a look at the Son of God, giving sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf and raising children from the dead—and what thanks does He get? ‘Devil child!’ ‘He’s possessed—by Satan, no less!’ Huh.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Yet Jesus refuses to back down. He continues to heal and help. He knows what He is here for and nothing will deter Him from it. When you know what you’re here for, you’ll do the same. People are entitled to their opinions but it doesn’t mean they’re right. Yes, they can mock you. But between you and God, you know the truth.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Jesus didn’t try to look good; He was good. He didn’t try to be truthful; He was truth. Despite leading this blameless life, He still faced insult. His followers did too, and they followed in His steps: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name [of Jesus]</em>.’ (Acts 5:41 NIV) Words are important and they can hurt. But. God’s words about you are true, and as you go through day to day life, you can probably see why it’s worth having them handy.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>If you’re being insulted or accused by people—pray for them. Pray blessings for them. Why? Because it’s the Jesus way. (And it’s a pretty powerful one.)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend...' Job 6:14 NAS<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s when life comes crashing in on us that we need the love, the sympathy and the support of our friends the most. Poor Job longed for it, but didn’t get it. In the midst of his suffering his friends offered him no more than churchy clichés and pious platitudes.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Job needs what we all need when we’re suffering—not someone to try and explain why things are happening or even to suggest strategies for how to cope with it, but just someone to be with us, and share our pain. That’s the real meaning of sympathy: not someone saying ‘there, there’ but someone actually being there. Sympathy says, ‘I understand what you’re going through and I’m here for you.’ Sympathy acknowledges our struggles and gives us the strength to overcome them.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Even when there seems to be no one around who can sympathise with your struggles, there is. Jesus sympathises with us—He can, because He’s been through the full spectrum of pain and suffering: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin</em>.’ (Hebrews 4:15–16 ESV) Jesus is the great High Priest mentioned here. Think He hasn’t been tempted like you have? Think again! With this in mind, ask the Holy Spirit to show you someone who is hurting today, and pray for an opportunity to show sympathy in an appropriate way.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail...' Luke 22:32 ESV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We all know how it feels to fail. Perhaps you’re used to hearing a voice inside your head repeating, ‘You’ve let all these people down… but most of all you’ve let yourself down.’ Ouch. At times like these, we need to remember Jesus’ disciple Peter. Perhaps no one in history has felt the weight of failure like he did. After promising he would never turn his back on Jesus, Peter publicly disowned Him, and felt the crushing, agonising pain of his own failure (Luke 22:54–62).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>That’s why we need to start telling the hopeful truth about failure. Yes, the hopeful truth. First: failure is inevitable. Don’t believe the lie: ‘If you were a real Christian, you wouldn’t have failed like that.’ When you put your trust in Jesus, He set you free from the law of sin and death, but your human emotions, appetites and desires are still at war with the Spirit at work inside you (Galatians 5:17). By His grace, you’re not the person you were, but you’re not the person you’re going to be either.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But also, notice what Jesus said to Peter before this all happened: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>I have prayed for you...</em>’ (Luke 22:32 ESV) Even in the middle of Peter’s ‘epic fail’, Jesus was in control. He was going to use this, the most painful episode in Peter’s life, to begin something amazing and new. Read for yourself the way Jesus restored Peter and how reconciliation made way for Jesus to use him in the future (John 21:15–19). Thank Him that He’ll use even the ugly parts of us to bring about something pretty wonderful.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...And they chose Stephen...' Acts 6:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Growth often brings problems. The early church had grown so fast (like a dozen or so to 3000 on the first day!) so the demands on it grew too, and especially as they related to serving the poor. People shared so wonderfully to start with that there wasn’t a needy person among them (Acts 4:34). But slowly the early church stopped focusing on helping the poor and started discriminating against certain racial groups (Acts 6:1).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>What to do? Make no mistake, this was a significant issue: remember what Jesus had to say about both serving the poor and preserving unity among believers (e.g. Matthew 25:35–40, John 17:21). In other words, it was a big deal when the apostles decided to delegate this one out. It meant they needed to choose carefully from the possible candidates. In the end, they let the community pick seven men, but they gave them a bunch of criteria to follow: the men needed to be ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom</em>.’ (Acts 6:3 NAS)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We’ll look at each in turn over the next few days. First of all, what does it mean to be ‘of good reputation’? And why does it matter? Proverbs 22:1 NLT says, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Choose a good reputation over great riches; being held in high esteem is better than silver or gold</em>.’ Can you think of an example from someone in public life who has sacrificed a ‘good reputation’ for ‘gold’? Get some friends to pray with you for them today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose...men...full...of the Spirit.' Acts 6:3 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>As we saw yesterday, the seven men chosen to serve in Acts 6:1–6 were not picked on a whim. Their job was far too important to turn just anyone loose on it. So we see three things that the apostles were looking for; three things they thought were absolutely essential to do this important job: a good reputation, and being full of both the Holy Spirit and wisdom.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Why’s it so important to be full of the Holy Spirit as a leader in the church? Let’s think about why Jesus promised the Spirit in the first place. In John 14:26 ESV, Jesus said, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you</em>.’ Jesus talks about the Spirit as a Helper, sent with a purpose: to teach His followers and to remind them of everything Jesus taught.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In order to go about Jesus’ business, these seven men needed all the love, compassion and grace of Jesus Himself. Hence why they needed to be full of the Holy Spirit. The same is true of anyone who would serve in Jesus’ name. The poor don’t need us, they need Jesus. We don’t have the power to reconcile fragmented communities; only Jesus does. Start to think of a mission activity you are involved with (street outreach? Alpha course? Youth group?) in this light: Jesus hasn’t sent you alone; He’s empowered you by His Spirit.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose...men...full of...wisdom.' Acts 6:3 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and… wisdom</em>.’ Yesterday we saw how the Spirit would ensure the men were kept on track by the close presence of Jesus through His Spirit. So what extra benefit is meant by including ‘wisdom’ in this list? What wisdom would be lacking if they already had the words of Jesus echoing round their heads?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘Wisdom’ here likely refers to the knowledge, skills and insights gained by experience of working with people in real life and business, and the study of the Scriptures. These men were not pretty faces—they had substance. Perhaps they were experienced businessmen or leaders in their family households. They had something specific to bring to the task.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Very occasionally, God takes a man or a woman with no prior experience in what He’s calling them to—and teaches them everything they need to know on the job. But much more often, God carefully (if sometimes unusually) prepares people for the job He has in mind for them (think Moses, David, Paul). So you don’t need to go to Bible College to influence people in church, but that’s the route God sends most leaders. God can prepare you to lead and serve His people wisely in any sphere of life—in the words of your career advisor, these are ‘transferable skills’. Track down someone you consider to be a wise leader and ask them how God prepared them to serve Him. (And how about you offer to buy the coffee). You might be surprised by what you learn.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Stephen, a man full of faith...' Acts 6:5 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Just one more thing before we move on from our look at what qualified Stephen and the Seven for being used by God. Stephen is picked out as ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>a man full of faith</em>.’ Maybe that’s a pointer to what’s about to come—in just a few verses’ time, Stephen will launch into a sermon so powerful and insightful it gets him killed. As Stephen knew, faith isn’t just what you believe, it’s what you say and it’s what you do.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>How do we remain ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>full of faith</em>’ like Stephen? (Without the getting killed bit, of course.) One thing is to feed it. The Bible is faith food. It says, ‘…<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</em>’ (Romans 10:17 ESV) That’s not just a verse about what happens when you find faith for the first time—it’s about the daily nourishing effect of reading God’s Word in the Bible. If <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>word4U2day</em> is your only spiritual ‘food’, you’re just not going to see the same growth as if you get stuck into <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>SoulFood</em> as well. You need to feast on Scripture itself—the more the better.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The other way to stay ‘full of faith’ is to use it. Faith is a bit like a muscle—exercise it and it’ll grow strong; don’t and it will grow weak and flabby. If you exercise regularly and get used to flexing it in all the different areas of your life, you’ll find yourself increasingly ‘full of faith’ like Stephen. Think about how you might flex your faith muscles in each of these situations: when you find out a friend is sick; when you hear of a financial need in a local ministry; when your church asks for volunteers to serve.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He went about doing good... for God was with Him.' Acts 10:38 ESV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>One of the most amazing things about Jesus is His approach to time management. As Peter preaches to the Gentiles about Jesus in Acts 10, one of the key things he mentions is that Jesus ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>went about doing good</em>.’ He was a man in demand with the not insignificant task of training twelve men to lead a movement that would change the world. Yet central to His ministry was simply ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>doing good</em>’.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus’ agenda interrupted by the demands of seemingly random people. But every story was selected by the Gospel writers for a reason; nothing arrived by accident. So what are they trying to tell us? Surely that what we see is in His life is a glimpse of what He would do in His death: Jesus laid down His life for others.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Following Jesus means doing the same—laying down our lives as He laid down His. That’s a hard thing to do, and, to be honest, we’re experts at finding reasons not to obey it: <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>I need to work these extra hours to provide for my family. I need skip that, so I can study more for these exams. I need to hang on to that money because I deserve that holiday</em>.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But if we let them, Jesus’ words cut through our excuses: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for My sake, you will save it</em>.’ (Matthew 16:25 NLT) How do you tend to respond when God tries to interrupt your inflexible, tightly–organised, written–in–concrete schedule and asks you to make time for someone who’s hurting?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...That you may not bear it yourself alone.' Numbers 11:17 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>At some point in our lives, we’ve all felt inferior. Not needed. On the outside looking in. Like we don’t fit—anywhere. And it hurts.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Take Church as an example: it can be SO easy in a world that seems to be run by outgoing extrovert types to believe that centre–stage is where the cool dudes hang out. But this is wrong, and there’s a bigger picture to look at. The best job you can possibly do is the one God has given you the gifts to fulfil. It’s more than likely your church is full of people who need someone to encourage them. An outcast who needs a friend. A tech desk that needs a faithful worker. A project that needs volunteers.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Is this an aspiration–knockdown? Well, you’ll be pleased to know we aren’t telling you to wash prayer meeting coffee mugs until the end of time. But God is always ready to teach someone and lead them into their ‘calling’—and that can start small. Starting with people who know you can be an ace way to trace your way into your calling.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Bottom line: get to know yourself. Praying and learning about your abilities/personality type can be really helpful. Why? Because you can relax, knowing that God ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>set His faithful people apart for Himself</em>.’ (Psalm 4:3 NIV) Make an appointment to meet up with someone you trust, and ask them what they think your gifts are. (Perhaps the same person you found for January 16.) Commit to challenge each other to put them to service, then meet up one month later to see what came from it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone look down on you...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>You can't live a life that's not your own. It's really important to accept the guidance of others, and to take on board any gentle nudges (or steel-toed kicks too, come to think of it) God might give to you through your fellow human beings. However, it's not up to other people to determine what's for you and what isn't. Just because your parents want you to be a doctor, doesn't automatically mean that's what God wants. You've got to have an open enough mind for God to guide you to what you should be doing, even if it's entirely different to what your friends and family think you should be doing.</p>
<p>The world defines 'success' differently from God. The most successful person in God's Kingdom isn't necessarily a CEO in an Armani suit. So, defy the world's expectations. God does. Paul told Timothy, 'Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young,' because people thought Timothy was an inexperienced kid. It's easy to let other people decide what your life should look like, and just assume they're right because they're older or cleverer or genuinely lovely. But Paul thought differently; and so does God. So get God's opinion. In the end it's the only one that counts.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 3-5, Lk 9:46-62, Ps 78:1-8, Prov 19:21-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62141&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They called the name of that place Baal Perazim.' 1 Chronicles 14:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There was a man. They called him David. King David. And the Philistines invaded his part of the land of Israel. (They had a history... David the Israelite vs. Goliath the Philistine. Awkward.) But before David slapped on his swordbelt, He checked with God. He said, 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?' and God replied, 'Go up... I will...' so David fought and defeated the Philistines through God's power (1 Chronicles 14). 'Afterwards, David said, &quot;God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.&quot; Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim (which means &quot;breaking through&quot;).' (1 Chronicles 14: 9-11 NKJ)</p>
<p>What do we learn here?</p>
<p>(1) David reminded himself that 'the Lord had made him king' (1 Chronicles 14:2). God called you, and His Spirit lives inside you. You are His. He is on your side. That's huge.</p>
<p>(2) David simply asked God, 'Shall I go up against the Philistines?' (1 Chronicles 14:10 NKJ) Seriously. Just ask God. What is He telling you to do? Obey that, and you'll come out on top.</p>
<p>(3) David gave God the credit: 'God has broken through my enemies.' (1 Chronicles 14:11 NKJ) God does amazing things. Sometimes He does them for you, sometimes He does them through you. When He does something good, let the world know. When the breakthrough comes for you, make sure you remember to tell everyone Who made it happen. Sing His praises whenever you can.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Lk 10:1-15, Ps 78:9-16, Prov 19:24-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62142&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Benaiah...went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.' 2 Samuel 23:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>Benaiah was the warrior in charge of all King David’s bodyguards. He went into a pit on a winter’s day, maybe to shelter from the cold. Just as his feet were defrosting, he found a new pit buddy: a lion. Maybe it had come in for shelter too. Or more likely, it was hungry and at most fearless in the scarce winter months. Benaiah couldn’t turn and run because he’d only meet a wall. He had to fight, or he’d die. The strongest animal in Israel was staring him down, snow steaming off its flanks. Benaiah’s courage, especially with cold feet, is the reason he is a famously valiant member of King David’s mightiest men. Because there was no middle ground to hide in, he fought the lion and killed it. Thousands of years later, God and His people still look at this personality trait as characteristic of the God–centred soul: boldness, right at the moment that fear threatens to swamp you. Think: when you can’t keep any more distance from the thing you’re afraid of, how do you respond? What puts steel in your spine when fear presses in? If you’re frozen with fear, for any reason, a good idea would be to ask some Christian friends if you can all meet up and pray about it. While it’s great to ask for advice, praying together is much more powerful. Because praying together lets God in on the problem.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 9-10; Luke 10:16-28; Ps 78:17-31; Pro 19:27-29<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62144&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And the Lord answered me: &quot;Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it.&quot;' Habakkuk 2:2 ESV<br /><br /><p>In today’s verse, Habakkuk the prophet had been given the job of getting God’s message out to everyone in Israel. Big ask. To do this he had to write down God’s message on tablets (no, this was not like an iPad, more like an iRock.) The idea was for Habakkuk to write God’s words down so that, like an athlete in a relay race, he could pass them on to the next runner quickly. Then that runner would pass them on to the next, and so on until the message was spread around the land. People would be able to share the message quickly because it was a clear message, an obvious message; anyone could get it. God always does this when He has an important message: He makes it clear. He makes it simple. Remember how He introduced Himself to Moses at the burning bush? ‘I AM!’ Think of the most popular verse in the Bible, too: ‘For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’ (John 3:16 NIV) Some of the Bible is tricky to understand, but the important stuff isn’t. So how are you introducing God to others? Is it in a way they can simply and quickly understand? For some people, the idea that ‘God is real!’ needs to be the first thing they hear. For others, the fact God is loving is a brand new concept. What message has God given you to share?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 John 1:1-3:10; Luke 10:29-42; Ps 78:32-39; Pro 20:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62145&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything.' Philippians 4:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>What happens when you’re praying instead of worrying? What feeds your worries? Until you can express your fears you can’t get rid of them. Putting your worries into words strips them of much of their power. In the book <em>Life of Pi</em>, Yann Martel’s main character, Pi, finds himself adrift at sea on a lifeboat with a 200kg Bengal tiger as his companion. While on the lifeboat, Pi begins to analyse his fears, both of the sea and the tiger. He gives this counsel: ‘You must fight hard to express your [fear]. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don’t, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.’ So pull back the curtain and expose your fears, each and every one. They’re creatures of darkness and can’t stand the sunlight. Financial fears, relationship fears, professional fears, safety fears—call them out in prayer. Drag them out and make them stand before God. How do you do that? ‘Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything… Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand…’ (Philippians 4:6–7 NLT) Send your fear packing. Pray, now. God’s the one who can act on the object of your fear, but the act of praying will also reassure you that you’re not being controlled by fear.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 1:1-14; Matt 4:12-16; Matt 5:14-16; Acts 9:1-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62147&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I tell you not to worry about everyday life...' Matthew 6:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, ‘Therefore I tell you, stop being perpetually uneasy (anxious and worried) about your life…’ (Matthew 6:25 AMP) Not because the stuff you’re worrying about doesn’t exist, but because committing it all to God throws our focus back on the One who can fully care for us, has cared for us, and is going to carry on caring for us. Philippians 4:6–7 NKJ says, ‘...let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.’ And the Phillips version puts it like this, ‘Don’t worry over anything whatever; tell God every detail of your needs in earnest and thankful prayer, and the peace of God which transcends human understanding, will keep constant guard over your hearts and minds as they rest in Christ Jesus.’ (Philippians 4:6–7 PHPS) When you’re more caught up in your love for God than concerned with getting over your worry, you often find that the worry melts off like candle wax anyway. So let your problems drive you into the arms of Jesus. And when you get there, stay there. Isn’t it odd how trying not to worry can become just another thing to worry about? Shouldn’t it be easy, this whole ‘not worrying’ thing? So go to God right now, tell Him all those worries and leave them with Him. If you start to worry again, say, ‘Sorry, Lord. I took back what I’d given You.’ And keep doing this until His peace really does keep guard over your heart.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 John 3:11-5:21; Luke 11:1-13; Ps 78:40-55; Pro 20:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He has sent me to proclaim freedom...recovery...release...favour.' Luke 4:18-19 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you look at ancient maps, you’ll see places which are marked with pictures of sea monsters (‘<em>Here Be Dragons</em>,’ that sort of thing) to warn off sailors. Were the dragons real? Well, they were real enough in the minds of the sailors. Think of a barracuda in an aquarium tank. A glass barrier divides one half from the other. Each time the barracuda tries to swim at it, it bumps into it. Ouch! Eventually, even if the barrier is taken away, the barracuda still won’t swim beyond that point—because, yep, it’s learned the ‘ouch’ point. The barrier is still in its mind. Jesus was sent to proclaim freedom, recovery and release. Satan will place barriers in your mind that say you can’t go beyond a certain point in life. The barriers are lies. But a lie is as effective as the truth if you believe it and act on it. The Bible is filled with stories of people who were thought to be too ‘little’ or way too insignificant to matter. Those same people went on to smash through barriers they thought they couldn’t. God used them to do amazing things. He’ll do that for you too, no matter how small or limited you feel, if you ask for it. A lie is as effective as the truth when you believe it. Christians are people of the truth, so ask God for His help to see where you or other people are struggling believing wrong things about themselves. Pray for ways to join Jesus today in proclaiming freedom, recovery and release.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 1-2; Luke 11:14-28; Ps 78:56-64; Pro 20:7-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Each of you must...speak truthfully to his neighbour...' Ephesians 4:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Christian lingo: that strange language that means we say, ‘Wow, that guy is really anointed at playing guitar’ instead of ‘nice guitar playing, friend.’ Sometimes to speak the truth properly, we have to ditch the lingo. Sometimes for people to feel heard and properly related to, we need to speak a little more, well, honestly. This isn’t to say that Christian words are wrong; specialised Christian words can make tricky ideas plain and shed light on deeper truths. But when these are overused, hard–to–spot barriers can form between Christians and our non–Church friends. To them, what does ‘grace’ or ‘God bless you’ even mean? We can throw in the odd ‘Christian–ese’ word when it needs to be there, but it is so much more honest when we say, for example, ‘I was hurt by what you said,’ than ‘You are being un–Christlike’; or ‘I don’t understand either,’ than ‘God’s ways are higher!’ The list goes on. Let’s use our language honestly to open a window on truth, not cover it up. And if there are tricky Christian words you use all the time but don’t know the meaning of, then check it out online or in one of those wildly big Bible concordances, if there’s one lying around.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 4:24-5:26; Luke 11:45-54; Ps 119:1-8; Pro 20:15-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62151&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.' Romans 7:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>You know those times when you know the right thing to do, but just can’t go through with it? When we walk away from something good and we dislike ourselves for it. When we actively hurt other people and it really sticks in our gut. Maybe we know our own sin quite well—and when we see it in our actions and attitudes or the things we attach ourselves to, it hurts. Sin constantly causes that inner struggle. The back–and–forth between good and bad. Check out the bigger passage behind today’s verse and you’ll get the idea: ‘I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. ...in my inner being I delight in God’s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me... Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!’ (Romans 7:16–25 NIV) What we’re called to do when we see our own sin is not to melt down, or get really annoyed at ourselves. It’s to return to God in our thoughts, not to our guilt. Eventually, as you do this more and more, you get the sense of the ‘the fear of the Lord’. ‘The fear of the Lord’ is a gift that prods us to go to God so He can reorder our habits, our mind’s patterns. He is willing to do this, and is just waiting for us to return to Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 6:1-7:19; Luke 12:1-12; Ps 119:9-16; Pro 20:19-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62152&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Put on the new self, created to be like God...' Ephesians 4:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>There are times when God’s laws seem ludicrous to us. It’s probably fair to say that some of them seem beyond human ability. Like, ‘be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect’—just what, even? But perhaps that’s the point. In Jesus you have a new, different self, and when you surrender your own ability to ‘do’ Christianity, you ‘put off your old self…and…put on the new self, created to be like God…’ (Ephesians 4:22–24 NIV) Is this still true even when you have to grit your teeth and really force yourself to obey God’s laws, moving past your first instincts? Yes. Living by God’s laws will become your instinct with time (Romans 6:17 tells us so.) It’s like when you’re coming around after waking from deep sleep. It takes a while to remember who and where you are. With time you realise you are a new person. Christian speaker Arthur Burt said, ‘I knew a man who always said “Keep looking down,” “You mean keep looking up, don’t you?”, “No! No! We are seated together with Christ in heavenly places!”’ As Christians we are no longer our old selves. We’re new, and we’re already at home with Christ and His laws, even if it doesn’t feel that way just yet. Next time you have the impulse to check Facebook or whatever on your phone, take the moment to pray for the person whose message you’re scrolling past. Caring for others is one way to ‘keep looking down’ and to ‘put on the new self, created to be like God.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 7:20-9:44; Luke 12:13-21; Ps 119:17-24; Pro 20:22-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62153&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...take thought for what is honest...' Romans 12:17 AMP<br /><br /><p>We all want good, honest friendships. But we also can’t help hoping that our friends see the right ‘version’ of ourselves. They are allowed to see the carefully–crafted Facebook profile, but we keep our raw, honest selves hidden. Author Brennan Manning calls that crafted persona ‘<em>The Imposter</em>’, and said that we put it on when we want to ‘present a perfect image to the public so that everybody will admire us and nobody will know us.’ You may find that in your Church community or house group it’s difficult to really be yourself. There is this idea that, if we just all show up together and call ourselves Christians, everything will work out. But real life’s not always as simple as that—we have to learn to remove our masks. To make a space for honesty, we need to trust God that people won’t be so offended by honesty it will destroy us. Honesty is a decision to act for other people’s good and our own good. Actually being honest, by not holding back our shortcomings and failures, means our friends have to get used to what’s true and real about us. But this is a real relief. It is so worth it. When we live genuinely, and trust in God, before our friends and the world, then the glory of God will be on show in our lives more than ever before.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 16:1-18; John 6:1-15; John 6:25-40; 1 Cor 11:23-24 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62154&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...In all things grow up into Him... that is, Christ.' Ephesians 4:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we saw that when we trust God, we can be more honest with ourselves and others about our shortcomings. Today we’re looking onwards. Ephesians 4 gives us a route into becoming someone who looks, sounds, and moves like Christ. The whole way through, this chapter is confident that we can get there. You are ‘created to be like God, truly righteous and holy.’ (Ephesians 4:24 GWT) ‘Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind...’ (Ephesians 4:14 NIV) What this Bible chapter says sounds next to crazy—‘<em>You, dear reader, hello—you! Yes, you can become like Jesus!</em>’—and it doesn’t hold back from letting you know. But spiritual growth doesn’t happen automatically. Growth always begins with a decision. When Jesus asked Matthew to become His disciple, Matthew didn’t really get all the implications of his decision; he more–or–less said, ‘Yeah, alright boss,’ and went from there. That’s all you need to get started. A decision. Nothing shapes your life like the decisions you make. If you want to know what you’ll be like twenty or thirty years from now, look closely at the commitments that rule your life today. Is the challenge of Ephesians 4 pressing into your life, now? Look at your commitments and priorities. Type them up. And put today’s verse at the top. How do the things you want or need to do line up with becoming more like Jesus? If they don’t, it’s time to rethink them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 10:1-12:22; Luke 12:22-34; Ps 119:25-32; Pro 20:25-27<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62155&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in Your providence watched over my spirit.' Job 10:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>We’re not likely to hear people say ‘God is my mother’. But some of the things we usually expect our mothers to do, God also does for us. God’s care, kindness and (yep, almost motherly...) life–giving love is there for us. We’re supposed to get comfort from it, when we need it. In Job 10, Job’s life has gone down the tube. He was alone. He was covered in painful sores. Most of his family was dead. Then he remembered where he came from in the first place. Job asked God where His comfort and care went to and why God had stopped acting like the good Parent he used to know. When we’ve lost perspective on our life because things are tough, we can turn to God like this. He’s the Provider who has promised to keep a caring eye on us all our lives, so we can say, ‘God—you birthed me into this world. You saved me and promised to look after me. Where are You now? Come help me!’ Job recognised he needed this kind of perspective. He looked back on his life and recognised that God had always been faithful, and it’s the same for us—He’s been with us since day one, and isn’t about to stop. You know that ‘just came back after a weekend/month/term away’ catch–up chat that happens when you get home? Have it with God. Just spend time talking through life right now with Him. Ask Him to have His hand in it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 12:23-15:29; Luke 12:35-48; Ps 119:33-40; Pro 20:28-30<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62156&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the law of the Lord.' Psalm 119:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>If we want to actually grow as His children, God wants us to do more than lean on His mercy. We need to start there. Absolutely everything has to come first from His love for us. Equally, that isn’t the end of His gift to us. He wants us to develop our character as we put His laws into practice, because we can grow into something better. God is a Father who wants to see us become closer to Him both in relationship and likeness. He doesn’t want us to see Him as Someone shouting down rules from the clouds. When we get this, His correction starts to make sense. We start to listen to His laws, to stay attentive for His voice that draws us into life, to see joy where we currently struggle with sin, to ‘get’ the need for discipline where we have no patience. He will resist our excuse–making, our posing, and our hiding from obedience because He’s painting a bigger picture. We only know whatever details are in front of us right now. But He knows how the whole thing is going to look when it’s finished! We only know the corner of the room we happen to be in today, He has the blueprints for the whole house. Be reassured that He knows what He’s building in you and that His plans are perfect.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 16-18; Luke 12:49-59; Ps 119:41-48; Pro 21:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62157&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give ear and come to Me; listen, that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you...' Isaiah 55:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>So let’s bring these last two days’ readings together. God’s care looks like the love of a good parent: sometimes comfort, sometimes discipline. But when we zoom out, it’s all part of His promise never to stop loving us. There’s a word for that. Many Bibles translate it as ‘loving–kindness’, but the Hebrew word for it is ‘chesed’ (pronounced ‘hes–ed’). ‘Chesed’ is the love promised by God to His people. It’s very different from every other form of love out there because it involves loyalty from a perfect God. His unshakeable, undeserved love that sticks with us because He is for us. Even when we’re against Him. 2 Timothy 2:13 NIV says: ‘If we are faithless, He will remain faithful.’ God knows we’re an unfaithful bunch—But that doesn't phase Him. ‘Chesed’ is an active love: not just a one–off sweet deal at the Cross, but God moving in our lives every day. This is great news. It makes us here at word4U2day excited, anyway! And God doesn’t force us to reflect His love! We enter out of our own freedom into a relationship with Him. Even when our feelings betray us, or we have a bad day and can’t be bothered with the thought of picking up a Bible, God’s given us something that goes beyond emotions, a love that we can decide to do, not just feel our way into. One good way of helping your decision/will to support your love for God is to read the Bible everyday.

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever is right... think about [it].' Philippians 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>A man chained in a prison cell wrote, ‘...whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.’ This was Paul, locked up in a foreign country just for being a Christian. He was writing the letter to the Philippians. He won’t have taken a lot of inspiration from his immediate environment—four tight corners and a damp ceiling—and, worse, he was stuck there day in, day out. It’s not always easy to get inspiration from what’s physically in front of you. Your school may not have been the nicest place to attend. Your street may not have been a great place to grow up. And on a bad day, being pushed into a tight corner just one time too many can kick off a gloomy mood. God is the stable centre of all beauty. Wherever and whenever you are, you can live healthily, if you are fixed on Him. Whether that’s some truth you’ve found in the Bible or a person who shows you the beauty of Jesus or just a morning of quiet worship while you get on with your job, it doesn’t matter. When we have God at the forefront of our minds we can say, ‘The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; You hold my lot. The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.’ (Psalm 16:5–6 ESV) American pastor Jonathan Martin said, ‘Whenever and wherever you see beauty, you will always be able to follow it back to Jesus.’ Keep an eye out.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 23:21-26:19; Luke 13:18-35; Ps 119:57-64; Pro 21:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62159&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be unbelieving, but believing.' John 20:27 NKJ <br /><br /><p>*<em>Previously, in the book of the Gospel of John...</em>* The resurrection happened and someone missed it. He got a bit huffy. ‘Unless I see the nail marks in His hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.’ (John 20:25 NKJ) Yep, it was Thomas and he wasn’t going to be taken in by any nonsense about people rising from the dead. As if! ‘A week later His disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” Then He said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.” Thomas said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”’ (John 20:24–28 NIV) Jesus put an end to Thomas’ unbelief, but He didn’t tell him off for having doubts. It’s so important we get this. Jesus does not hate us for struggling with doubts—not even doubts about His existence. What He wants to do is show you Himself, not punish you for wondering or thinking. Your doubts do not disqualify you. (It’s important to add we shouldn’t allow them to take control. God isn’t a ‘tame lion’ and He won’t always show Himself up the way we ask Him to. But countless doubting Christians have found that when they’ve searched for God, they’ve found hope.) Recently been finding yourself doubting? Take it slowly. Step by step. Whatever’s on your mind, share it with someone you trust—maybe your youth pastor. And, our inbox is always open. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 26:20-29:30; Luke 14:1-14; Ps 119:65-72; Pro 21:10-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62160&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This has been your manner from your youth...' Jeremiah 22:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>How often do we go through our days multi–tasking between our ‘Christian’ mind and our ‘normal’ mind? Like tabbing between pages on a web browser, this can eventually use up all our attention and wear us out. We are whole people, not fractured beings. Splitting off our minds into a spiritual bit and non–spiritual bit ends up being unhealthy. How do we fix this? First up: habits are key. The patterns in how you think about things, how you act in certain situations, and the behaviours you return to, make up your whole person. So they’re pretty important, and God cares about them (Like, a lot. The story behind today’s verse is God calling out His people for repeatedly ignoring Him over centuries...) Habits can keep your attention on God and the person He has made you to be, bringing your mind into a focused peace. Habits free you up to do things more quickly and remove mental clutter so that you can think clearly about important things. They play a part in making your whole being a place that God can come and live in. More on that tomorrow! A good way to check your habits may be to have someone you respect and trust question you on the way you react to people, particularly when you’re tired or upset. Are your responses coming from a fear of people, or a ‘fear of God’? (check back to August 8 for more on the ‘fear of God’.) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 4:4-26; John 7:37-41; Exo 17:1-7; Isa 35:1-7 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62161&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And you shall again obey the voice of the Lord and keep all His commandments... [He] will again take delight in prospering you...' Deuteronomy 30:8-9 ESV<br /><br /><p>Your habits make a habitat. If those habits make a habitat of praise, then it will be a place where God comes and lives. ‘You inhabit the praises of Israel.’ (Psalm 22:3 NKJ) When we try hard to live in a way that is in line with God’s law, though we can’t fully get it right at first (trying to love your enemies—whaaat?) our attempts make room for God to come and ‘fill in the gap’. So, for example, we may start out trying to love people who are very hard to like. It’s definitely possible to act for the wellbeing of another person without actually liking the person. And God wants it, and we’re keeping His command, so that’s great. But as we keep on trying out that ‘practical’ love, we make space for God to come and fill our hearts with a love that includes feelings, includes joy, and includes—yes!—actually liking the people we find hard to like. This is the power of the Holy Spirit. Our attempts to do things we find impossible make us fall back on the transforming power of God, and His grace. We submit to God and He enables us to make it happen. You could start (if you’re feeling brave... err, not feeling brave? Then ask Him for a bit of courage), by approaching the person who’s come to mind in this reading. A few difficult but meaningful kind words can change a lot. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 1-4; Luke 14:15-24; Ps 119:73-80; Pro 21:14-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62162&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who is he who condemns?...' Romans 8:34 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When it comes to an area of your life that needs improvement, it’s good to be concerned about it, but not consumed with it. You’ll always be working on some area of your life, so learning that who you are in Christ is not going to change will be pretty important if you want to sleep at night: ‘There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus…’ (Romans 8:1 NKJ) Because God has chosen to see you ‘in Christ’, He finds you acceptable, every day (more than that, He’s downright thrilled to know you. Really.) and you always have access to Him. Your ‘who’ is not based on your ‘do’. God’s not about shaming and blaming you. Yeah, He’ll convict you (meaning His Holy Spirit will point out the things you’ve done wrong.) When you stop resisting His goodness (hint here: repent—that means decide to turn your back on your bad habits and turn to Him) He’ll get you back up on your feet, but He won’t be shaking His head and glaring while He does it. You do that to yourself. God never will. ‘Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who makes intercession for us.’ (Romans 8:34 NKJ) This means Jesus gives you His thumbs–up, and it remains the only thumbs–up–or–down that matters. Conclusion: ”What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:31 ESV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 5-7; Luke 14:25-35; Ps 119:81-88; Pro 21:17-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62164&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are they... who walk according to the law of the Lord.' Psalm 119:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have a flick through Psalm 119, and you’ll see that the writer really, really liked getting stuck into God’s law. This is not just a hobby. So, why should we choose to focus on what only God wants for us, and not work off our instincts or other people’s advice? You’ll start to understand the Psalmist’s enthusiasm about hard moral codes if you think about kids playing on a cliff edge. Without a fence you’re counting the seconds until one of them makes a fatal faceplant. With a fence, there’s no worries. God’s law is a fence that brings incredible freedom. Maybe it’s only a matter of time until one of the kids starts wondering what’s on the other side of the fence. If they don’t know or trust the fence builder, they hop the fence—and kerplonk. Brutal. If they survive, they come back saying like the Psalmist, ‘I used to wander off until You disciplined me; but now I closely follow Your Word.’ (Psalm 119:67 NLT) The Ten Commandments start with the words, ‘I am the Lord your God…’ (Exodus 20:2 ESV) All the don’t kill, steal etc. bits come after; God speaks about the relationship first, then about the rules that keep it on safe ground. It’s when we understand that the fence builder absolutely loves us and wants the best for us we’re happy to stay on the right side of the fence. In your prayer time with God today, ask Him to point out where He’s put up important fences you might have not seen yet. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 8-11; Luke 15:1-10; Ps 119:89-96; Pro 21:20-23 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62165&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up.' Proverbs 12:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Your stomach’s in knots, you feel like an elephant’s on your chest, your thoughts are smashed by a whirlwind. Where can you find relief? In stressed–out days it’s hard to remember that you, as you are, with all your weakness and tired thoughts, are still valued by God. He has said you are His beloved. Even when you come down harshly on yourself, He does not change how He thinks about you. When you forget that God has said you are valued, it’s important to have friends who will come and show you that. Especially if you show kindness to others when they are struggling, but you don’t always show to yourself. One of the wonderful things about being part of the Church is that other Christians can ‘be’ Christ to you in those moments. They can show you what God thinks of you, in patience, quiet listening, in some well–placed humour at the right time. These are really important ways we experience the love of God through our friends who carry His Holy Spirit. Do you have those sorts of friends? And, if you’re feeling pretty on top of things at the moment, are you that sort of friend to someone else? If you’re going through a stressy patch, it could be helpful to venture out and connect with friends who’ve proven to be good listeners before. Or you can txt (0401 132 888) or call PrayForMe (1800 PrayForMe), if you want to chat it over anonymously. Find a way to bring your anxiety to God.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 2 Chron 12-15; Luke 15:11-32; Ps 119:97-104; Pro 21:24-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62166&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.' Psalm 94:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p>About three hundred years ago, minister Matthew Henry rifled through the Bible and wrote cool comments on all the verses. Here’s what he had to say about today’s verse: ‘The world’s comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God’s comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away.’ Today, most people sense there must be something deeper to how we feel than ‘just getting through’ from day to day. To stay in touch with our humanity we have to look out for God’s comforts. As you walk around today, notice what God puts in your path. The old clichés are to watch a sunset or lie on a beach. It’s true; these are things we can be grateful for when we’re able to do them. But you might have to train yourself up to look out for the beauty of God in places you can notice every day. To appreciate a conversation with a friend. To make a small gesture of kindness to someone in your family you take for granted. To stop being hurried and find that deeper comfort that the world can’t take away. When you do this, you might even find that the Author of beauty Himself sneaks up on you to delight in it with you. Nothing restores your soul more than God Himself. If you’re on autopilot today, take a deep breath, switch it off and turn to Jesus in prayer. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 16-18; Luke 16:1-18; Ps 119:105-112; Pro 21:28-31 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62167&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

She quickly got fearful she wouldn’t know what to do if the Nazis confronted her. So her dad told her, ‘When you are going to take a journey on the train, do I give you your ticket three weeks early or just as you get on the train?’ Corrie said, ‘As I get on the train.’ ‘So God will give you the special strength you need to be strong in the face of death just when you need it, not before.’ Are you worried you don’t have the strength to live for God? Feel like you lack the ‘oomph’ to be a powerful Christian? Whether you discover it like Corrie, facing danger and persecution, or right when you step out to tell someone the Gospel, or in the moment when you get hit by hurtful insults, God’s strength comes right when you need it. We’re even promised: ‘...don’t worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given the things to say. It will not really be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.’ (Matthew 10:19–20 NCV) Whether you feel it or not, your God has got your back: when you step out for God (and maybe not even a second beforehand), you’ll discover you have all that you need. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 19-21; Luke 16:19-31; Ps 119:113-120; Pro 22:1-3 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62168&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God led you through the wilderness...to prove your character...' Deuteronomy 8:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>In Florida, wiry trees called Caribbean Pines thrive in deadly environments. They stick out drought, fire and hurricanes. In fact, if you plant them in a setting trees normally love, they’re so hardcore they just shrivel and die. It can be a similar case with our souls: we shrivel because things go so well we feel we don’t need God. Sometimes we need a wilderness to refine our faith like the children of Israel who were led into the desert: ‘to prove [their] character, and… find out whether or not [they] would obey His commandments.’ They could choose to give up and shrivel up there, or trust Him to bring them safely to the Promised Land. When things get too comfortable, our faith actually shrivels. The odd blast of wilderness can be genuinely good for us. Sometimes God allows the fiery draught of very difficult times so we can see what’s in our faith—is it made of the good, solid stuff that trusts in God?—and to mature it and get to the true and better person inside. God leads you through the wilderness to prove your character. That also means that He’s in control. Your ‘wilderness’, if you’ve given your life to God, is both for a purpose (the best there can be: His loving plan for you) and it’s safe—in His hands. Look back on the last three months. What hard times have you been brought through? What good things have come from them that couldn’t have happened otherwise? Rejoice when rough times look like they’re about to sweep in. Bring it on! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 10:1-18; Rev 7:13-17; Ps 23; Luke 15:1-7 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62169&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The works that I do [you] will do also...' John 14:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p> Jesus told His disciples, ‘The works that I do you will do also.’ Skip forward to the book of Acts and guess what? They did! They took on His character and became like Him. What happened in between? He mentored them. If you want to get somewhere in life, ask God for the right mentors. Some mentors you get for a short chunk of your life, others for a lifetime. Some of them might even be close friends who end up discipling you in a quiet, hidden way. So how do you recognise a mentor? They might be someone who sticks by these promises: (1) I’m willing to spend time to build a close relationship with this friend; (2) I’ll keep believing in the potential of this friend, keep getting them excited about the future I see ahead of them; (3) I’m willing to be vulnerable and available to my friend, to share not only my strengths and successes, but also my weaknesses, failures, and generally–rubbish moments; (4) When it’s right to, I am willing to be honest in confronting my friend; (5) I am committed to standing by them through trials—even trials that they bring on themselves; (6) I’ll help them set goals for a spiritual life or ministry; (7) I’ll actually practice what I preach. None of this ‘talking the talk without walking the walk’ business. Find a mentor. Become a mentor. It’s a top way to fit all the different pieces of the Christian life together. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 22-24; Luke 17:1-10; Ps 119:121-128; Pro 22:4-7 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62170&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His sheep follow him because they know his voice.' John 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you’re chatting with a good mate, there’s an ease in the flow of your conversation because you know who you’re talking to. You know the person who’s listening to your words. You feel safe in knowing what you say won’t be taken the wrong way. Talking to God is sometimes less easy when you’re first getting to know Him because it can feel like talking to a blank canvas (maybe you remember that, or you’re going through it now). Who is He? What does He want to hear? What does He want me to say? Or even if He seems to have gone quiet with you, or was never ‘loud’—how do you get into a place where you can even begin to learn to hear His voice? This is why so many of Christianity’s traditional prayers start with thanks. When we start our prayers with gratefulness we are doing what’s right (giving God His due for everything He’s given) and we’re starting to get a sense of the person we’re talking to: the Giver of all good gifts. When we’re thanking Him, we’re starting to learn His character. Ann Voskamp says, ‘Giving thanks in all things is how to pray continually [1 Thessalonians 5:17–18]... This is the way to do God’s will for your right now. Thanks to God is what calms the wild heart.’ So, praise Him! Lots! Then listen out...</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 2 Chron 25-28; Luke 17:11-19; Ps 119:129-136; Pro 22:8-10 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62172&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He... shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' Psalm 91:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>What is the ‘shadow of the Almighty’? You might think of an overcast day and wonder if this is a bit of a not–very–sunshiney gloomy thought. But if you’d been living in the blistering heat of a desert for the last forty years—which is exactly what God’s people had been doing for a fair chunk of the Old Testament (post–Prince of Egypt)—then it’s something a little more appealing. So the Israelites, as you can imagine, liked a good shadow or two. It meant shelter and comfort in a very hot climate. What does it mean for us? We know that God’s personality isn’t all–guns–blazing, instead He’s our place of safety. We can read ‘shadow’ as ‘safety’. In the blistering heat of life’s battles, temptations, and worries, God is the life–saving shadow we can always come back to. Yes, we have to go on the offensive sometimes, and withstand the attacks of Satan, and fight back with Scripture. But, in reality, as humans, we aren’t set up to be at the forefront of battle all the time. We need to rest in God. Think about this: could you spend the whole day walking in the shadow of the person beside you. How close would you have to stay to be able to manage it? Would you have to change the rhythm of your walk to stay there? What does this tell you about ‘being in God’s shadow’? Yep, stay close and move as God moves.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 2 Chron 29-31; Luke 17:20-37; Ps 119:137-144; Pro 22:11-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62173&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith is the substance of things hoped for...' Hebrews 11:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There’s lots we can’t do on our own. Especially as Christians. Stuff like overcoming the world—see 1 John 5:4—can only be done with faith in God. ‘Faith’ is one of those words that’s not often defined for us (like ‘Hosanna’ or ‘Amen’... ‘Bless’...) But today’s verse gives a pretty clear definition of what faith is. What does it look like? (a) Being certain of victory. Back to 1 John 5:4. Our victory over Satan comes by faith, not by willpower and discipline. Faith comes from the Word of God, not from anything within ourselves. (b) Being certain of growing to be like God. Faith isn’t a one–time event that starts and finishes the moment you become a Christian. We keep growing in our faith. By learning. ‘So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.’ (Romans 10:17 ESV) And by doing. ‘What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?’ (James 2:14 ESV) So much of this ‘faith’ business is about being ok with the future. This is not easy… if you’re struggling to see past things that worry you, head back to August 3 &amp; 4. And soak in the knowledge that, as you spend daily time in the Word of God (try SoulFood), that God will build faith in you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 32-34; Luke 18:1-17; Ps 119:145-160; Pro 22:14-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62174&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...He has commanded us to love one another...' 2 John 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Life can be busy. And it’s great (really, really great) you take time out with God in the middle of all that. So now, what about your on–earth relationships? Jesus made it pretty clear the second most important thing in life, right after loving God, is loving people (that’s in Matthew 22:37–40, team). And to do that, we have to spend time around others— even those irritating, imperfect, demanding, frustrating people. It’s awful for our relationships if we don’t put time and effort into them. That’s how friends ‘drift apart’ and how families can start to misunderstand each other. Plus, we need other people. That few minutes spent chatting to your mate, or that Sunday roast round the table—it all adds something to your life because God made us to live in community. The love of others is good for us. And, the love we send out is good for those others. Ask God to fill you up with His love, to the point that you’re positively overflowing with it. Then, if you take the time to really share a little of your day with another person, chances are, you’ll be able to share God in some way too. Even if that’s just in the friendly hello someone needs to hear today. A practical exercise in loving: Go to your phone. Scroll down to the 10th person you texted and start there. Pray for that person that they’ll have a really blessed day. You could even send them an encouragement to top it up, if you liked. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 35-36; 2 John; Luke 18:18-30; Ps 119:161-168; Pro 22:17-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62175&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.' Philippians 3:13 NLT <br /><br /><p>In Philippians 3, Paul talks about how he really, genuinely, very–very–earnestly wants to live a Jesus–centred life. But he’s under no illusions. He knows he’s not already perfect. Read Philippians 3:12–13. There, Paul explains something so important— that, no matter how human he is in this life, he’s adamant that he’ll press on, looking forward to his future relationship with Christ perfected in Heaven. What a brilliant example! We all need to recognise where our lives don’t look like Jesus’, and take those areas to God in prayer and apologise. As soon as we give our mistakes up to God, He lays them to rest, reminding us to move on, looking ahead to our final goal of being with Christ forever. But we can have a tendency to keep hold of the past. Sometimes that’s through guilting ourselves, but sometimes in a very different way. In a weird way, it can be tempting to look fondly on our past sins (Really. Think about it… it happens more than you might realise). There’s a part of us all that’s twisted and wants to be loudly proud of those ‘wasn’t I a rebel’ moments. Truth is, that point of view is just not healthy. If you’re still tied to your past in any way, it’ll be harder to move forwards, towards ‘that perfection’ that Paul calls for us to focus on. Think: what have you done (or do you still do) that you feel stops you heading towards ‘that perfection’? Pray your apology, and ask for help. Then hit delete. Let it go from your records, just like it’s gone from God’s.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 3 John; Jude; Luke 18:31-43; Ps 119:169-176; Pro 22:20-23 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62178&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Endure until your testing is over. Then you will be mature and complete...' James 1:4 GWT<br /><br /><p>Tomorrow is the official start of Spring. Flowers and stuff. Great. Then, a few months from now, spring will have sprung and it’ll be sizzling into summer. Your life works the same, in cycles and seasons. That means some periods of our lives are all green grass, shiny newness and fresh loveliness. It also means some periods will be dead leaves, rain and sniffles. Whichever you have right now, God’s on it. He’s the one who decides when we get spring–like growth seasons. And when we need a stretch of... being s t r e t c h e d... He brings us into (and through) it. ‘For everything there is a season.’ (Ecclesiastes 3:1 NLT) That’s not to downplay how outright rubbish those tough seasons can feel. But they’re a necessary part of God’s long–term plan. Think about a tree. The only reason it has space to grow strong, healthy, green leaves in spring is because it lost the leaves it’d finished with last autumn. And it only grew new ones after shivering, bare–branched, through winter. If everything looks barren and cold around you right now, we 100% guarantee it’s only for a time. In that time, the best thing you can do is stick to God, and let the difficulty He has allowed you to face do its work. Seasons come and go. So it’s important to have a stable centre to your life. Are there any places in your room that you can turn into ‘prayer spaces’? It doesn’t have to be a wooden bench to kneel at, it could even just be a beanbag. Make it special place to remind you to meet with God each day.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Phil 2:5-11; Rev 19:11-16; Acts 3:1-16; Matt 1:18-21 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62180&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge...' Joshua 20:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the Old Testament, God’s people had a High Priest every generation, set apart and ‘anointed with the holy oil’ (Numbers 35:25 NRS) to represent that generation to God, and also to represent God to them. When he died, then the one who had represented God had passed away. God allowed his death to signify the removal of sin from His people and to ‘reset’ their relationship with Him. This was particularly useful with regard to the laws about accidentally killing someone. Legally, the victim’s family could take your life in exchange. Not good. But God is all about forgiveness. He told Israel to set up six ‘cities of refuge’—essentially safe bases. You ran to them, explained your story to the town elders, and hid out in the town, knowing they were duty–bound to protect you. No–one hunting you was allowed to enter the city at all. Safe. And the thing that really showed the extent of God’s grace was this: you weren’t even trapped there for life. When the High Priest died, you were ‘forgiven’—released from your sanctuary and allowed to go home. No one was permitted to harm you. The relationship had been ‘reset’. Spotted Jesus yet? Jesus, our ‘High Priest’, really represents us to God (Hebrews 4:14): Jesus didn’t just carry us into a Temple’s Holy of Holies but into the throne room of Heaven itself. He died once, for all time, resetting our relationship with God to ‘forgiven’. If you run to God’s refuge in Jesus, then wherever you are, Satan can’t touch you, and you’re in a completely restored relationship with God. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 1-4; Luke 19:1-10; Ps 84; Pro 22:24-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62181&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!' Psalm 133:1 KJV<br /><br /><p>Grab a Bible and read Psalm 133. It’s short. It’ll probably take about half a second. Ok, maybe half a minute. Chances are you’ve heard that opening verse before. And yeah, it certainly is nice when we get along. But why? What is there about unity that’s so special for us Christians? Is there something more to it than it just making us feel warm and fuzzy? Well, verses two and three of Psalm 133 name oil and dew. Hmm. It might seem a bit poetic at first, but it’s got real meaning. Oil being dropped on a person happened as a symbol of the Holy Spirit ‘anointing’ them, and the power that comes with that. More often than not, that ‘anointing’ was a sign of God giving someone the power to go and carry out one of His plans. And dew crops up in Isaiah 26:19. Interestingly, it’s a symbol of that same power giving new life (by resurrecting the dead) to God’s people. Oil = God’s Spirit and power. Dew = God’s Spirit and power. So, what the Psalmist seems to be saying here is that, when we ‘live together in unity’ (Psalm 133:1 NIV), something mind–blowingly huge happens—as a community, we receive death–beating power that enables us to do what God wants. God comes to rest in a very real way over the collection of people who are brought together because of Him. As individuals, we don’t have what we have as community. Pretty good reason to do that ‘fellowship’ thing, huh? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 5:1-8:29; Luke 19:11-27; Ps 103:1-12; Pro 22:27-29 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62182&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.' Romans 12:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday was all about what happens when Christians work together. Wonderful stuff. Now. How? How do we work together? How do we do unity? Paul has some great advice in Romans. He compares the Church to the human body. He writes: ‘...since we are all one body in Christ, we belong to each other, and each of us needs all the others. God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out when you have faith that God is speaking through you.’ (Romans 12:5–6 NLT) One good way to work together with the church around you is to do exactly that: to find out from God what role He has made you to fulfil, and then fulfil it. After all, He created the overall plan. He’s created everyone around you to fit together, kind of like a jigsaw. If every piece chooses to be the right shape, the overall picture will come together, no problems. And, with a God–designed team around you, you have no reason to be nervous of taking up your part in things. You can step up to your place in the knowledge that the guys and girls around you are commissioned by the same, unshakable God. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 8:30-10:43; Luke 19:28-40; Ps 103:13-22; Pro 23:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62184&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he who does wrong will receive the consequences...' Colossians 3:25 NAS<br /><br /><p>John Ortberg writes: ‘My friend Andy Chan headed up the placement office for helping graduates find work. He says that some day he wants to write a book called The Myth of Passion. This is the myth that somewhere out there is the perfect job, the idealised calling that fits my soul the way a key fits into a lock. And if I could just find that job, torrents of passion would cascade out of my heart like water going over Niagara Falls.’ Just about all of us have a romantic idea that we will find ‘job–love at first sight.’ But what if you are in a job that doesn’t excite you? What if you have to study stuff that seems downright boring? Ortberg writes: ‘Passion for our work is not usually a subterranean volcano waiting to erupt… It is a muscle that gets strengthened a little each day... as we do what is expected of us, and then some.’ Paul wrote: ‘Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord... knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done.’ (Colossians 3:22–25 NKJV) Maybe it would help to put a sticker up on your phone: ‘For God’s sake—do your best!’ Why? For two reasons: (1) Because you represent Christ wherever you go. (2) When you are faithful in small things, He will promote you to greater things (Matthew 25:21). </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 11-13; Luke 19:41-48; Ps 111; Pro 23:4-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62185&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If I can just touch [Him], I will be healed.' Mark 5:28 NLT<br /><br /><p>Mark’s Gospel records the story of a Jewish woman who, for twelve solid years, had been suffering from an ‘issue’ of constant bleeding. For this lady, in the society in which she lived, the impact on her life was devastating. She was totally broke, having spent all her money on medical bills. The religious laws said her husband couldn’t go near her. Babies were totally off the cards. Everything she touched was considered ‘spiritually unclean’. The religious laws meant she couldn’t even go to worship God in the Temple. She was completely worn–out, and not even allowed to go to God’s house to be refreshed. At the end of her tether, she decided to put her trust in God. She went out into a crowd that was disgusted by (and probably afraid of) her, and she grabbed hold of the fringe of Jesus’ prayer cloak. And it worked. Her earnest faith did something amazing—it drew the power of God to her, and she was healed. She was freed from all of the laws that made her life difficult. She could enter God’s temple, stand tall in her community again, not look in the mirror and see ‘unclean’. And all of this, just from grabbing Jesus’ garment in an act of faith as He passed by. What could you do, if He stood in front of you now? Is there an ‘issue’ where you need to reach out in faith to Jesus to be healed? Take it to Him now.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 14-15; Luke 20:1-8; Ps 142; Pro 23:7-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62187&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit...' 1 Corinthians 12:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, ‘There are different kinds of gifts, but the same spirit.’ Successful people invest their time, energy and resources into their core strengths. Why? Because that is where they get their highest return! Occasionally they’ll try their hand at something new. Take Michael Jordan, for example, arguably the world’s most famous basketball player. For various reasons MJ decided to try his hand at baseball for a season. He may have enjoyed the experience, but exiting the game so early is probably not what he’d like to be remembered for. God gave you gifts that make you unique, gifts that hold great possibilities. But you have to discover them and develop them. A sign on a DIY shop says it all: ‘We’ve got it, if you can find it.’ Nobody was ever born without talent, including you, but you’ve got to find it. What keeps us from doing that? (1) The company we keep. The old saying goes, ‘If you run around with turkeys, you’ll never fly with eagles.’ The Scripture says, ‘He who walks with wise men, will be wise...’ (Proverbs 13:20 NKJV) (2) Failing to spend time in prayer and in God’s Word. God is not only the giver of your gift, He supplies the strength to function successfully in it. Aristotle said, ‘We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit.’ So if you want to succeed, consult God, and operate in your God-given strength. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 16:1-19:23; Luke 20:9-19; Ps 20; Pro 23:10-12 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62188&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us love one another, for love comes from God...' 1 John 4:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Oops. We said it. But relax; we’re not going to force you into marriage. What we’re talking about is Godly commitment to everyone around you, and everything you do. God commits to loving, growing and parenting you. And with Him doing that, you can’t help but share that love with others. The whole of 1 John 4:7 NCV reads: ‘Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become God’s child and knows God.’ Now, hands up… who speaks Greek? Hmm, stick with us anyway. That second sentence, ‘Everyone who loves has become God’s child and knows God’ isn’t exactly straightforward. In the original Greek, there is one word that means ‘has become God’s child’, and it does some weird stuff with tenses. It’s past and present all at the same time; it means ‘has become God’s child right at that point, and will continue to become more and more God’s child as time goes on.’ Sooo… everyone who shows God’s love has been adopted by God and shows Him through their relationships and work. But it doesn’t stop there. God promises to put work into fathering and teaching them, every day, for the rest of their lives (pretty good model for commitment). And under that sort of attention from God, our human commitment to sharing love with the world becomes way more do–able each day. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11; Matt 21:18-22; Matt 8:5-13; Mark 6:1-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62189&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be patient, bearing with one another in love.' Ephesians 4:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>When it comes to any of our ‘relationships’ with others (literally any friendships, siblings, colleagues you kinda–don’t–wanna–but–kinda–hafta sit next to, marriage, parents), there’s a simple acid–test we should be checking. Ready? Here it is: ‘Am I going in the right direction?’ But what does this question mean about navigating a world populated with friends and strangers? Well, all your thoughts, plans and decisions are either heading in your direction, or away from yourself and to God’s direction. And God’s direction is always towards the well–being of the other person. Guess it’s kind of obvious. We all have relationships we don’t enjoy, though: what about when they just keep getting it wrong, and we have to get all defensive? Or when they’re so full of gossip that it’s impossible not to join in (and maybe later gossip about them too?) Or when they’ve messed up but so have we, and still the easiest thing to do is just pass the blame entirely on to them? Hmm. When you are taking the trouble to bring about the best for another person, not to focus on their problems or mistakes, you’re doing it right. Choose not to gossip. Instead, make it a habit to give genuine compliments to others and build them up. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 19:24-21:45; Luke 20:20-26; Ps 112; Pro 23:13-15 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62190&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life.' John 6:63 KJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, ‘The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.’ (John 6:63 NIV) Obviously, the Bible as we read it today wasn’t in existence when He said that; He was talking about His own, out–loud words. But His words are recorded in what has become the Bible—the parables and sermons that He used to tell His disciples are now part of Scripture. Just like Jesus’ on–earth speeches, the rest of the Bible is made up of words that have come right from God. And they remain full of God. The potency and power that will change your life is still there, waiting for you to discover them. Sometimes, though, reading those words just doesn’t happen. Too much effort. Not enough time. Simple forgetfulness. So let’s tackle this head–on. This week’s readings will focus on how to grasp the words of the Bible, remembering that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bible is massively important.</li>
<li>And sometimes it’s hard to know how to use it as a practical tool.</li>
<li>But we think we can help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next few days, we’re going to have a good dig into what the Bible is, what it does and how to use it. Whether you’re well up on the Scriptures, or you struggle to remember where you left your Bible, we think it’ll have something good to offer you. The Bible really is great, but it’s worth taking some time to remind yourself of the whys and hows of its greatness.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 22-24; Luke 20:27-40; Ps 27; Pro 23:16-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62191&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.' Job 23:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Job could not find God. He just couldn’t. And it’s not like he didn’t try. The thing is, sometimes God chooses to be silent for a while. Sometimes He steps back. He’d never do it without good reason (and it’s frustrating when we don’t know the reason), but sometimes it’s necessary. The question that lives in that type of silence is: ‘How do you fill it?’ If it seems you can’t feel or find God, how do you navigate your life with Him? Well, the fact is, by some sort of Design, His words are always around. You guessed it. The Bible. Even if you don’t feel bird–sized butterflies in your stomach while you’re reading it, the Bible’s still speaking directly into the life you’re living. That’s what it’s there for. Job didn’t feel the presence of God for ages, but could still confidently say, ‘I have kept to His way without turning aside. I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.’ (Job 23:11–12 NIV) He loved the words of God that He remembered from the past, even when God wasn’t speaking to him in the present. And that’s what kept him going. That’s what kept his life right when he couldn’t hear God in any other way. What are some Bible verses you should write out and keep in your wallet for those days when God seems silent? Commit them to paper today.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Col 1-2; Luke 20:41-47; Ps 78:1-8; Pro 23:19-21 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62192&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that...you may grow...' 1 Peter 2:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Let’s face it. We don’t always feel like reading the Bible. It’s all well and good to be told to ‘crave pure spiritual milk’ like that, but craving isn’t a choice, is it? Not exactly. But you can choose to make it a daily practice, steering yourself towards a place where it’ll happen naturally. Scripture mentions the need to get rid of ‘all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind’ (1 Peter 2:1 NIV) before craving spiritual milk. It makes it seem like Peter thinks that it’s not possible to get to a place of true, honest desperation for Godly growth whilst having a heart full of hateful emotion. Hmm, curious that… Also, 1 Peter 2:3 NIV explains that craving good God–things comes from having ‘tasted that the Lord is good.’ You have to ‘taste’ your Bible (read it a bit) and notice the positive effects, before you can start to crave it regularly. The first step towards that is to commit to a routine. To make the decision to read a bit of your Bible every day. The second step is to actually do it. Even when you really don’t want to. Especially when you really don’t want to. And if you miss a day or two (or a week), pick it up again anyway from that day. Keep going. Then, maybe after a while, you’ll find that it becomes a part of your day that you look forward to. Get started then! Plan exactly when you’ll spend that time today, then actually do it. SoulFood will help you start. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Col 3-4; Philemon; Luke 21:1-11; Ps 78:9-16; Pro 23:22-25 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62193&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You received His message... And this word continues to work in you who believe.' 1 Thessalonians 2:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>So, after taking yesterday’s advice onboard—what then? What do we do with the Bible that we read? Let’s look at 1 Thessalonians 2:13–14. It explains a sort of folding–out effect from getting close to God’s words—starting with hearing or reading them, and ending in living them out. Thessalonians 2:13 lays out the in–between steps that makes living the Bible possible. And they’re pretty interesting: (1) ‘You received the word of God…’ —That’s the reading, the listening. There’s no way around it. Read your Bible. (2) ‘You accepted it not as a human word, but as… the Word of God.’ —This is about recognising the value and authority of those words of God. It’s so important to remember the Bible is a Spirit–infused letter, full of God’s authority and knowledge. (3) ‘Which is indeed at work in you who believe’ —All of that Spirit, authority and knowledge of God that’s in the Bible… well, it’s ‘at work in you who believe.’ If you read God’s words and acknowledge the power of them, that power starts to work as part of your life. Then, after the reading, the accepting, and the having–it–work–in–you, comes the action. And it comes very naturally. Once you’re changed on the inside, the choice to ‘live it out’ should be an easy one. You’ll learn the best way to act from your Bible (Jesus is a good example for that), and find yourself more ready to follow it. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 1-4; Luke 21:12-24; Ps 78:17-31; Pro 23:26-28 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62194&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and Your servant loves them.' Psalm 119:140 NIV<br /><br /><p>Psalm 119 is kinda incredible. It’s a really impressive acrostic poem (remember them? They’re the ones where the first letter of each line spells out a word or name) and it constantly refers back to the words of God. Every single thing that this Psalm says about God, or asks of Him, comes back to the Torah (the old Hebrew word for teaching or direction. It comes from an archery term and the idea behind it is instruction on how to hit a bullseye every time). It’s veeeeerrrryyy obvious this poet was extremely focused on it; he’s clearly read it a lot and constantly comes back to it. All of the stuff the poet knows about who God is circles back around to his knowledge of the Torah. There’s something we could (and should) learn from this. In 2014, Christians always seem to stress the relationship with God as the important thing. And that’s true. But, over the centuries, it’s possible we’ve lost touch with the fact some of that relationship is built through following the Bible’s instruction. We can get to know so much about God’s personality through the pointers He gives us in His Word on how to live. When we really get to grips with how to live as God wants, we automatically get to know Him better. Psalm 119 demonstrates it. When we read the Bible in a way that changes us and our actions, we open ourselves to being pulled a whole lot closer to Him. So, if you don’t already, why not dedicate a day a week to God as a ‘Sabbath’ holy day? Decide to rest, to make real time to dig into His written word (start with Exodus 20:8–11), and serve Him through serving those around you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 5-7; Luke 21:25-38; Ps 78:32-39; Pro 23:29-35 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62195&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is one...mediator between God and men...Jesus.' 1 Timothy 2:5 KJV<br /><br /><p>You’re a professional bricklayer. We all are. We spend our days adding bricks to the wall that separates us from God. Most Christians call that wall ‘sin’. Call it what you will, it’s built to separate us from any sort of relationship with God–the–Father. And sin would’ve gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for Jesus. He came, He gave Himself up, and He tore down all the walls we ever built (and ever will build) between us and the love of God. That’s what 1 Timothy 2:5 means—that Jesus is the one who stands alongside humankind and God–the–Father at the same time. He communicates across the gap between us and God, and makes things right—He even prays on our behalf (see John 17 for details). When Jesus said, ‘No one comes to the Father except through Me’ (John 14:6 NIV), that’s exactly what He meant. No one can kneel, stand, sing, whisper, cry or anything before God if they don’t go to and through Jesus first. He fought and died for our right to be on good terms with God. And that’s the absolutely vital importance of Jesus in Christianity. If it wasn’t for the Master–Plan of His sacrifice, we’d have no place before God. We’d have no Heaven to look forwards to. Instead we’d have, well, nothing but outer darkness for company. Practical exercise: grab a scrap of paper. Write down the name of a particular sin you feel is really hard to shake off at the moment. Read your Bible. Pray that God will remove that sin away from your life through the power of His Son Jesus. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:23-28; Exo 3; Exo 33:7-23; Exo 34:29-35 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62196&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.' Colossians 3:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>It’s fair (and right) to work through feelings of hurt, not deny them. But, forgiveness still has to happen. Have a look back at yesterday’s reading. Jesus stepped in to fix things between us and God. This hurt Them—the Father and Jesus both. It hurt Jesus in the shape of metal nails, whip–lashes, spears and a crown of thorns. And it came with its own soundtrack of the careless laughter of His enemies, alongside the heartbroken cries of His family. But He embraced the experience, full of forgiveness. Jesus shows there is a healthy way to get over hurt. Forgiveness is not about staying the victim, but about taking control through loving–but–strong action. He did it so we could be let off for all of the wrong things we still do. Wow. That’s inspiration enough to forgive the people who’ve acted really terribly towards us. Still, it doesn’t actually make it much easier to do. (And sometimes there need to be other steps first—like letting people know if you’ve been seriously hurt and it’s been kept secret.) But it provides the reason to. And, incidentally, the whole amazing plan of the Cross provides a bridge back to God as well as access to His power. And if anything can help you to forgive, it’s God’s power. Just ask Him. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 8-10; Luke 22:1-13; Ps 78:40-55; Pro 24:1-4 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62197&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.' Matthew 7:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In Matthew 11:5–8, it tells the story of some guy who knocks on his neighbour’s door in the middle of the night to ask to borrow some bread. The neighbour mutters to himself, rolls over, grumbles, rolls over some more and finally, because he can’t stand the guy’s continual knocking, opens up and gives the guy what he wants. All because he wouldn’t stop knocking. You see, God admires persistence. It’s not that He wants us to be rude, He wants us to know what love He has for us. He invites us to ask for what we need so that we will experience that love. He makes it pretty clear—‘Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.’ (Matthew 7:7 NKJ) If you want to hear from God, start up the conversation. Ask Him to speak. Don’t shout out from a distance, go right up to the door of His Word and knock. Steadily. He’s already on the other side of the door, waiting to answer. But don’t hightail it outta there as soon as you’ve pressed the buzzer once. Stay there, and make sure you’re ready for His response. It’s no good asking anything of God if you don’t make space and silence to hear back. Stay parked at the door of His Word, reading it carefully and you’ll find what you truly seek. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 11-13; Luke 22:14-23; Ps 78:56-64; Pro 24:5-10 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62198&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...By love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>To work for God properly we have to have the right people around us, giving us the necessary pointers, handing us the necessary materials or just cheering us on when we need it. And God makes sure that happens. Whatever He’s planning for you, He’ll first drop you in exactly the right situation to make it happen just how He wants. That means He’ll steer you into the right place, at the right time, with the right group of people around you. That’s pretty good of Him, huh? All of the people around you are there because God wants them to be. Seriously. If you carry the person of Jesus in you (like… by being a Christian) then God will be arranging appointments for you. He’ll put people in your path. And they might just be the key to His next step for you, whether that’s by developing some part of your character, or by sending an opportunity your way. So take your relationships to God, the good along with the bad, and ask Him for the strength and maturity to recognise God–given people and opportunities. And make sure to be patient with every single person in your life. Extend grace to them constantly. Who knows what role they may end up playing in the future? And lastly, pray for those around you. Whenever you get the chance. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Micah 1-4; Luke 22:24-38; Ps 78:65-72; Pro 24:11-14 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62199&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We know that all things work together for good...' Romans 8:28 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It’s a danger to stop Romans 8:28 right after the word ‘good’ as lots of people do. We miss some critical information that way. This verse packs a real punch. It calls for active life–changing. Take a moment to read it again, slowly, out loud. ‘And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) Try the same with John 14:21 NIV: ‘Whoever has My commands and keeps them is the one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I too will love them and show Myself to them.’ So, those who obey God love Him. And those who do that have everything in their lives sewn together for their good. If we want the ‘all things working together for good’ bonus, we’re called to live like God wants. We have to actually love God in our actions and thoughts, not just sing it in songs and tell Him in prayers every now and then. Re–reading Romans 8:28 with that thought in mind feels a little punchier. It’s no longer just something encouraging to say when someone’s had a bad day. It becomes a call to act in the way that Jesus teaches us to, in order to have a really good life. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Micah 5-7; Luke 22:39-53; Ps 24; Pro 24:15-18 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62200&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Think about all the rights we have enshrined in Australian law. The right to education, free speech and communication, to live free of all sorts of discrimination. But, sometimes, we can cling to our ‘rights’ until our fingers turn blue and we’re kicking and climbing on others to keep hold of what we think we’re entitled to. That isn’t Jesus–like. Think about it. Then check out Philippians 2:1–11. That’s right. Jesus ‘...did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for His own benefit... He gave up His place with God and made Himself nothing.’ (Philippians 2:7 NCV) He took on the status of a slave. A slave. The King of the universe didn’t see Himself as too entitled to anything to step right down onto this messy, ignorant earth. And He didn’t step down onto a comfy, shiny, golden throne; He placed Himself in a rough old animal trough. More than that—He died the death of a criminal. He definitely didn’t deserve that. And that’s our example to follow. If stuff that we don’t deserve comes our way (and it will, at some point), Jesus shows us that it’s our job to deal with it gracefully. We’re called to find the balance between living healthy lives for ourselves, and putting others (appropriately) first. Tricky, but it’s definitely do–able. That’s the way that Jesus lives. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Tim 1-4; Luke 22:54-62; Ps 19; Pro 24:19-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62201&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.' 2 Peter 1:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>You’ve heard it. You probably aim to do it. Why, though? To show your friends what Christianity should look like? To make the world a better place? To please God? They’re all good reasons, and they all happen, in their own way, when our lives start to look more like that of Jesus. But God has a far more personal reason to ask us to imitate His Son. You see, the request for us to ‘live like Christ’ is an offer, not just a command. After He’s set you free from sin (and only after that), God offers a new way of life, filled with ‘grace and peace’. The fact of the matter is this: living that new, Jesus–style life is exactly what we were built for. So once we start allowing ourselves to act like God wants, we start to look like the person He designed us to be. That’s when that ‘grace and peace’ come into play. Making the decision to delve as deeply as you can into Jesus’ life, and putting what you learn into practice, won’t lead you any way other than towards God. And, the closer you get to God, the more you’re surrounded by His ‘grace and peace’. So, when He asks you to live like Jesus, what’s He’s saying is ‘come closer to Me, and life will start to feel as it should.’ And that is the ultimate offer of all time. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 1-4; Luke 22:63-71; Ps 3; Pro 24:23-25 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62202&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Leaving you an example, that you should follow in His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus’ heart is geared towards others. He loves us, and He loves God. Everything about Him is built on His own relationship with His Father and the Holy Spirit, which is, safe to say, entirely perfect. He’s also intent on bringing us imperfect humans into that relationship. So, obviously, Jesus is pretty plugged in to the Holy Spirit and God–the–Father. Jesus’ first recorded sermon starts: ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me…’ (Luke 4:18 NAS), and He went off alone to talk to His Father heaps of times throughout the Gospels. He’s so in tune and in love with the Spirit and the Father that they’re a constant feature of His words and actions. That’s a great model to live by. The way that God works (the Jesus–Spirit–Father bond) is the best model of living in relationship that you could wish for. It’s worth spending some time having a look into how Jesus lives it out in the Gospels. That others–focused heart is one of the foundation–bricks of knowing how to live like Him. If we’re raring to love and serve God and, by extension, the people He’s created, then being Jesus–like becomes more of a natural leaning. If you think you’re ready, pray to God that He will make your heart more like Jesus’. Ask Him to prompt you throughout the day to act in a Jesus–like way towards others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 17:1-6; 1 Ki 18:16-39; 1 Ki 19:9-18; 2 Ki 2:1-12 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62204&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Take the yoke I give you. Put it on your shoulders and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 CEV<br /><br /><p>Have the last three days got you worried? Does the challenge to ‘live like Jesus’ sound too much? Stop, and maybe even write this down somewhere. The first call of Christianity is not ‘Live Like Jesus’. The first call is: ‘Come Home, All Is Forgiven.’ The call to live like Jesus is for after that. It’s for after you’ve come home, after you’ve been picked up and held safe by the Father of the universe. So if you’re worried that you’re not thinking, or acting, like Jesus, don’t panic your way out of His arms. From inside those arms you can watch His heart and thoughts close up. It’s only once you’re home that you can see how the Son deals with problems. Sure, we really want you to live like Jesus. (Fact is, we really want us all to live like Jesus...) Imagine what the world would be like if we all did. But if we allow ourselves to slip into thinking, ‘If I don’t live like Jesus... am I really a Christian?...’ we’ve allowed ourselves to swallow the secret lie that it depended on us being holy enough, or doing enough ‘things’ as a Jesus–copy. That’s not what the Cross was for. Living like Jesus is something that God grows (and not overnight) in the lives of those who have been called to Him whilst they were still dirty, tired, and broken. The only thing that every single one of us needs to ‘do’ is receive the love of His Father. The rest comes from there. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 5-8; Luke 23:1-12; Ps 39; Pro 24:26-28 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62205&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile...' Mark 6:31 NLT<br /><br /><p>In today’s verse, we notice Jesus telling His disciples He wanted a decent bit of quiet time. Did He get it? Well, no. Not right then. They went off to find that ‘quiet place’ and got followed by crowds. Instead of a chilled Jesus–and–His–pals time, a little thing we’ve come to call the ‘Feeding of the Five Thousand’ happened. Not that relaxing at all. As soon as that amazing miracle was done, Jesus ‘went up on a mountainside to pray.’ (Mark 6:46 NIV) Just like the rest of us, Jesus needed time out. He had a busy, busy, busy life but He never allowed Himself to be overwhelmed by His work. When things were too hectic, He took Himself off, normally up a mountain, and spent a while away from everything. Just Him and God. Now, even though we don’t have crowds chasing us around, our lives can feel (nearly) as hectic as that of Jesus. And, just like His, our planned time off can be sniped far too easily, either by work or by that super–active eager friend. It’s so important to step back every now and then, sometimes to just do nothing (yes, that really is ok sometimes), as well as having those times to spend with God. So, pick a day. A whole day. Schedule it in as a day for nothing but rest, relaxation and time with God. Plan to do something you enjoy. And stick to it. Put it on your calendar now. Maybe even think about making that a regular thing… Yes! Actually have a Sabbath?! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 9-11; Luke 23:13-25; Ps 34; Pro 24:29-31 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62206&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...All...were astonished at the catch of fish...' Luke 5:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus never trained as a fisherman; His trade was carpentry. Yet, in Luke chapter five, He gave fishing advice to professional fish–catcher Simon and his partners. Simon had worked all night and seemed to have decided to follow Jesus’ advice more to humour Him than anything else. Despite showing more than a hint of doubt, he still did what Jesus said. He didn’t say, ‘Look, buddy, I’m the professional here. It’s not the right time to fish.’ He simply said, ‘Because You say so.’ It works exactly the same for us. Whatever our specialist area is, God knows what we need to do to max–out our potential in it. And He’s ready to share that know–how. The problem is, we often assume we know best. Or that God isn’t particularly interested telling us how to be the best essay–writer ever, or most–efficient barista ever to have worked the coffee bar. But if God’s placed you in a role, He’s the best person to advise you on it. Just ask Him. Don’t let doubt stop you from saying, as Simon did, ‘Because You say so.’ Taking God’s advice in the everyday can often be more important than it seems. Simon did what Jesus suggested concerning his fishing–job. Then, as soon as that was done, he found himself moving on to being a ‘fisher of men’. God’s current plans and instructions may be preparation for, or a sign of, bigger plans to follow. So, take Him up on His advice, and see what happens. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 12-14; Luke 23:26-34; Ps 52; Pro 24:32-34 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62207&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...calls things that are not as though they were.' Romans 4:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Umm, stop a second. Just think about that verse. God ‘calls into being things that were not.’ God speaks, and things that didn’t exist suddenly… do. That’s huge in two ways. First, only God has that power. The Bible definitely doesn’t say we call into being things that were not. It doesn’t say your parents or friends call into being things that were not. At the end of the day, no matter what effect we feel people’s words have on us, they don’t actually change anything. Just because someone you thought was your friend called you an idiot, doesn’t make it true. If your parents tell you you’re going to be a doctor, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s going to happen. On the flipside, it means that whatever God says is absolutely 100% true. Whatever He speaks comes into being. If He says you’re going to be a doctor, you will. And by Him saying it, it becomes a thing. A real–life, living–breathing, guaranteed thing. You need to have faith like Abraham and be “fully convinced that God [is] able to do what he [has] promised.” (Romans 4:21 ESV). We’ve pointed out God’s promises and declarations for you lots of times before. (If you missed them, then Romans 8:1 &amp; Romans 8:31 should get you started.) Forget what anyone else has said. The only important thing is what God has said. </p><br /><br />SoulFood (Feast of Trumpets): Num 29:1-6; Matt 24; Rev 11:15-19; 1 Cor 15:50-58<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62208&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...His own received Him not.' John 1:11 KJV<br /><br /><p>We all come up against rejection. Jesus had a lot of it. ‘He came to that which was His own, but His own did not receive Him.’ (John 1:11 NIV) There are two examples of ‘His own’ here: His very own created universe, belonging to Him. And ‘His own’ did not receive Him; this means His people—those whom He chose and loved as His own didn’t want to be seen near Him. Ow. They even accused Him of being fake (check out Matthew 12:24, for instance.) When God gives you a passion for something, when you’re dead set on making a positive change, then it’s usually not a dead–end (unless you’re ignoring God–honouring motives and into something a bit reckless or stupid—worth asking your church leader if you want a double–check!) Jesus didn’t let one person’s voice silence Him, He simply moved on and took His life–giving message to whoever would listen: ‘...to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.’ (John 1:12 KJV) So, what matters most, rejection or reaction? Whenever you feel put down by someone’s dismissal of you, going back to God first is your best bet. Don’t go into a knee–jerk defence, ask your heavenly Father to defend you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 1-3; Luke 23:35-43; Ps 54; Pro 25:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62216&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.'  Matthew 6:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever been to a pawnshop? The idea is simple; if you need money, you take a valuable item like jewellery or a musical instrument to the shop where the pawnbroker checks out the quality of it and gives you cash in exchange. But if you don’t return within the specified time to redeem the item, you lose ownership. Although it was yours originally, you no longer have legal possession till you buy it back. And if you wait too long, it can be lost forever. Have you ever thought of yourself as somebody who needs to be redeemed, so you can be returned to your rightful owner? God created us to enjoy a relationship with Him. But sin caused us to fall into ‘the snare of the devil...held captive...to do his will.’ (2 Timothy 2:26 NAS) Restoration to God, your rightful owner, could only come through redemption. And that’s exactly what God did! ‘For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.’ (John 3:16 ESV) Christ’s death was the price of your redemption; that’s how much God values you! But redemption only becomes a reality when you realise you’re a sinner, and trust Christ as your Saviour. The moment you do, He reunites you with God—ransomed, redeemed, restored to your original owner. So the question is: have you taken up His offer of salvation, the one that makes you a member of His family? If you’re able to read this, it’s not too late. You can do it right now wherever you are. (If you’re a little hazy on what to pray, check out the inside back cover of this devotional for some help.)</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 1 Cor 4-6; Luke 23:44-56; Ps 13; Pro 25:4-8 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62210&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There was a man who had two sons.' Luke 15:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here’s a story you may have heard before. A father. Two sons. The younger brother wants out of the house. He leaves and messes up. On return, he is welcomed with open arms. Is this about leaving for uni? Nope. It’s about walking out on what our heavenly Father wants. He has an awful lot in store for His ‘children’, but sometimes we don’t want to live under His care. Now, let’s look a bit closer: Both sons had their faults: one was miserable, but obedient. The other, younger one was the classic rebel of the story. It’s hard to say who was really worse, deep down. Both of them were self–centred. You might not be the problem child, but (and we know this is rough to consider) do you have any traits of the jealous older brother? In the parable, the father says ‘…Everything I have is yours’ (Luke 15:31 NIV) to his older son. The older son didn’t seem to get that. He was worried about his kid brother getting an extra share of their inheritance. Sometimes, even though we’re right in front of the Father, we can be so focused on our ‘rights’ that we forget to look at Him for guidance. So, let's keep our eyes on Jesus. He's the 'older brother' of everyone who is part of the family of God and He gives us an example of how any 'older brother' should rightfully behave.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:7; Gen 6:9-22; Gen 8:18-22; Matt 24:36-41 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62212&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He came to his senses...' Luke 15:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>To fully understand exactly who God is, it might be we have to reach a low point. A really low point. Our own personal pig–sty can put the love of God that we’re missing back into perspective. It can lead us to the first part of repentance (turning back to God). So, it took a lot for the younger son to finally come to ‘his senses’, after walking out on all his father had for him. However, today’s curveball from word4Uday is another thought regarding the older brother in the story: was he guilty of something just as bad? In a house with his loving father, completely cared for, supplied with everything he needed, he still hadn’t come to his senses. Check this out: ‘…This son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ (Luke 15:30 NIV) Ouch. He didn’t think his kid brother deserved any favours… true, but neither did he. Unlike the younger son, he wasn’t aware of his problem: judgmentalism. He built himself up by tearing his ‘unholy’ brother down. As Christians, one of the first stumbling blocks we need to get past is simply accepting that God, our heavenly Father, loves us. Sounds simple, huh? But if we truly get our heads around it, that we simply can’t do anything to earn it, it makes accepting others a lot easier. That’s the kind of perspective on things that the younger brother had—he knew he wasn’t worthy. Think about what God gives us freely. Acceptance? Freedom? What else? Now, show some of that grace to someone who needs it—invite them into your life/friendship group and get alongside them. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 7-9; Luke 24:1-12; Ps 91; Pro 25:9-12 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62213&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He was lost and is found.' Luke 15:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>The last couple of days we’ve focused on the older brother in the parable of the prodigal son. There’s a lot there for long–standing ‘got it together’ Christians. But today, we thought we’d address the main character in the parable, the younger brother. Like his sibling, he didn’t fully grasp the nature of his father, but for different reasons. When he walked away from his home, he left all the good he could have freely had. Who in their right mind would do that? Everything he needed to live life to the fullest was right under his nose. That definitely sunk in later. And like the prodigal son, when we look back in hindsight at a good thing we’ve left behind, it’s easy to admit we’ve been stupid (think of the robes! think of the inheritance! think of the cake!) Finding yourself stuck in a rut with no strength left and nowhere else to turn is often when you realise you should have stayed in the house, where God’s got everything we need. But, in practice, turning back to God takes some real humility—we can either stick it alone, or run back home with nothing to show for what we’ve done. Yet, that’s what matters. Messing up is not the end of the story. Nope. The younger brother got up, and chose to admit his mistakes. The Father was waiting for the son with open arms. Do you need to come home today? Take a look at the inside back cover.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 1 Cor 10-11; Luke 24:13-24; Ps 68:1-18; Pro 25:13-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62214&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...All that I have is yours.' Luke 15:31 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Last one. Let’s wrap this up with three big points: (1) Anger holds you back. You won’t learn or grow if, whenever you see something positive happening in someone’s life, you take up the ‘older brother’ attitude of criticising it. Nah. That’s not good. We’ve all been there, and there’s no other way round it, if we’re ever to grow: along with the Father, we need to forgive and move on from the irritations that others might cause us. (2) ‘…Son…all that I have is yours.’ (Luke 15:31 NKJ) There it is, plain and simple: there was enough to go round for not just the prodigal son, but the older brother. When you notice God rocking someone’s life, He’s not forgotten you. And He certainly won’t hold back from blessing you beyond anything you could imagine. (3) God always listens. Sounds obvious? The older brother didn’t think so. But God says: ‘Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.’ (Hebrews 4:16 NIV) We reckon that, if the older brother just asked for help to overcome his bitterness, life would have even far simpler for him. If any one of those points resonates, make time now to be honest with God. It pays off.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 12-14; Luke 24:25-35; Ps 68:19-35; Pro 25:17-20 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63435&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Take a look at today’s verse (we couldn’t fit it all—definitely a good excuse for you to crack open your Bible… :) hint…) It’s a bit of a pressure–point in society today, but comparing themselves to others can make our lives difficult. Thankfully, it’s possible to find confidence in God. But, can it go both ways? Is it sometimes a little too easy to be comfortable in our own skin? Here it is: what about when we KNOW we’re good? Like, being humble is all well and good, but as soon as you know you’ve got an intelligence/ability one–up on your mates/colleagues, doesn’t it get a bit too easy to be happy with yourself, at the expense of relying on God for your self–worth? Well, those who are ‘commending themselves’ (first part of the verse), was written in reference to false teachers within the Corinthian Church who were big–noting themselves and criticising Paul and his authority as an Apostle. They thought they were 'all that', and pretty much nobody could touch them. Yet here, they (and we) are warned of assuming we’re the standard to measure by. So, how is it possible to really be good at something, but not compare yourself negatively with others who aren’t so good? ‘Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.’ (2 Corinthians 10:17 NIV) That winning ability that you have? Don’t let your self–worth hinge on it: acknowledge that it’s God–given. Whatever it is, it’s meant to build others up, not for putting them down. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 15-16; Luke 24:36-44; Ps 60; Pro 25:21-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62217&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.' Psalm 56:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Oi. You! Yes, you! Come out from behind that plant. Metaphorically speaking. In Genesis 3:8, Adam and Eve knew they’d done wrong. It was enough to make them need to change their fig–leaves (and they’d only put them on fresh about a verse ago, sigh). They were so terrified of the consequences they went and hid in some bushes. That didn’t work too well, either. God is good at finding people. So, why do we still try to hide? When that ‘sin’ happens, we can often try our very best to avoid God. We don’t want to face telling Him about it, or dealing with the aftermath. We don’t want to experience His disappointment in us. Or our own disappointment in ourselves. It’s easier to just keep our mouths shut, and hope we can carry on without having to face Him. But that’s not God’s plan. Life with Him isn’t some sort of monstrous game of hide–and–seek. Take a look at Genesis 3. When God found Adam and Eve, He started a conversation. He dealt with their mess. Then (in the first verse of chapter 4), He still helped them. You see, there’s always going to be consequences for our mistakes. But, when we take them to God and ask Him to deal with them, there’s still Life with Him in and after those consequences. So, trust God’s justice. Be honest with Him about your mistakes now, tell Him about them frankly. Deal with the consequences. And watch Him make something beautiful out of your life. </p><br /><br />SoulFood (Day of Atonement): Lev 16; Lev 23:26-32; Heb 9:1-14; Heb 13:11-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62219&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures.' Matthew 22:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>Remember playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey as a kid? As soon as that blindfold went on and you started to spin around, your other senses would go into overdrive to try and compensate. Could you sniff your way to victory? The world teaches us to rely on the stuff we can see and sense to be able to find our way. So when one or more of those abilities fails, we end up pinning tails nowhere close to target. But what if someone you trusted guided you all the way? What if you had a mate who whispered ‘Left a bit… straight ahead… up a centimetre!’ in your ear? Yes, it’d probably get you disqualified, but you’d also land right where you’re supposed to. Knowing and trusting God’s Word is a bit like that (except it’s not cheating!  happy days.) There will be plenty of times in life you’ll need to pin a tail blind, when you won’t be able to see clearly ahead. But you’ll still need to make wise choices. Taking the time to know what the Bible says about the things you might face is vital—it means that, when all your senses fail, you’re still right on course.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Heb 11:8-12; Gen 17:1-27; Gen 22:1-18; Jas 2:21-24 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62221&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord's instruction is right... His commands...give us light.' Psalm 19:8 CEV<br /><br /><p>There’s a hilarious section in Adrian Plass’ book, <em>The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass, aged 37¾</em>, where Adrian opens his Bible at random. He’s in search of some encouragement, but lands on: ‘The dogs licked up the blood.’ (1 Kings 21:19, in case you wondered…) Not exactly the words of promise he’d hoped for! Do you ever do that? Wait until you’re upstream without a paddle and then go frantically scrambling for random Scriptures? Do you ever treat the Bible a bit like a lucky dip? ‘Must find a verse—ANY VERSE—to make me feel better!’ Psalm 19:8 CEV tells us God’s Word ‘makes our hearts glad’, that His commands ‘give us light’. But why wait until you’re in the middle of darkness to go lucky dipping for light? Instead, the Psalms say that God’s Word should be ‘stored up’ (Psalm 119:10–11 ESV) and Job says ‘I have treasured the words…’ (Job 23:12 NAS) Storing and treasuring take time and dedication, but it’s totally worth it for the sake of not getting into a flap when trouble comes. Count the Bible verses you know off by heart, not including John 3:16. Have you counted more than three? It’s useful to know Scriptures word–for–word, because there will be times when it helps LOADS to have those promises already stored in your head. Writing them down or saying them out loud might help you to memorise them. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 4-6; John 1:1-13; Ps 63; Pro 25:26-28 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62222&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The entrance of your words gives light...' Psalm 119:130 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you type ‘Bible or the Bard’ into an internet search, you’ll come face to face with a quiz that asks stuff like: ‘Who invented the phrase give up the ghost—Shakespeare or the Bible?’ Frankly, would you know where that phrase came from? It’s a decent exercise for letting us know whether we’ve spent more time in the sonnets or the psalms, but the Bible is so much more than just a collection of snappy catchphrases. So here’s where we level up and get serious. Paul says to Timothy, ‘Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analysing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skilfully teaching] the Word of Truth.’ (2 Timothy 2:15 AMP) That’s a tricky verse to get your head around, but it basically says: ‘Get your head in the Bible. Know it. Understand it. Tell others about it.’ That doesn’t mean just memorising the bits of the Word that give you warm fuzzies. It means studying the bits you’d rather skip. Why? Because time and again we’re told that God’s Word—all of it—is a ‘light’, and not only for us, but for those around us too. Started with SoulFood yet? Had a try but found it too hard to keep going? Ask God for help as you switch on the ‘light’ and begin again. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 7-9; John 1:14-28; Ps 92; Pro 26:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62223&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In this world you will have trouble...' John 16:33 NIV<br /><br /><p>We’re told not to worry about our lives (Matthew 6:25), but it’s also vital not to be naïve. Wearing a WWJD wristband does not make you exempt from life’s issues—and if Jesus Himself says trouble is a certainty, you can be sure that sooner or later it’ll be doing more than knocking on your door, it’ll be kicking it down. You could encounter any number of testing scenarios—health issues, relationship breakdowns, money worries; a whole bunch of things that could potentially stare you out and threaten to take you down like the Incredible Hulk on a bad day. But the next bit of today’s verse in John 16:33 is the ultimate save–the–day line. Jesus says: ‘But take heart! For I have overcome the world.’ Note Jesus doesn’t say that all the trouble will evaporate. Instead, He’s pointing you out to the bigger picture—a picture of the endgame. You don’t need to sit there paranoid and wondering when the next battle is coming, because He told you 2000 years ago that it’s already taken care of. And just in case there’s any doubt about the outcome, here’s a hint: you in Him = win. So, armour up today. Read Ephesians 6:10–20 to remind yourself of the spiritual weapons at your disposal: helmet of salvation, breastplate of righteousness, belt of truth, shield of faith, sword of the Word of God, shoes of the preparation for the Gospel of peace and, capping them all, prayers and songs of praise. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 10-12; John 1:29-42; Ps 29; Pro 26:4-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62224&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>In <em>The Matrix</em>, Neo discovers his mind has the ability to create and affect the world around him. He can withstand bullets, jump 50-metre gaps, and bend spoons—just by focusing all of his mental energy on the ‘truth’ (and by engaging his intense stare/squared–jaw combo, naturally). He learns the hard way that, the moment he loses sight of that ‘truth’, the world around him has the ability to crush him. The battle is primarily in his mind. The Bible says that the truth sets you free (John 8:32 NIV), but that’s not a one–time event. Your mind is a battleground, and knowing Jesus doesn’t make you immune to very real attacks of despair, fear or self–pity. Sometimes, we just don’t have the mental energy, and that’s ok. But the ability to remind yourself of His truth in the middle of the turmoil is the difference between withstanding the enemy’s ‘bullets’ or not. Verses like Joshua 1:9 ‘I am the Lord your God, and I will be there to help you wherever you go’, Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and courageous... the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you...’, Jeremiah 15:20 ‘I am with you to rescue and save you,’ says the Lord, Isaiah 12:2 ‘The Lord Himself is my strength and my defence’ and many more exist to make you strong when the world tries to crush you. They are the kind of truth to build your life on. As soon as the worries start to wage war in your head, declare with certainty: ‘I will not be afraid. The Lord God Himself will fight for me.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood (Feast of Tabernacles): Lev 23:33-44; John 7:1-40; Zech 14:16-21 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62225&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth...' John 4:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>You may not believe your ten minutes of wailing <em>Amazing Grace</em> in the shower does a whole lot, but the Bible says that worship packs quite a punch. Ever heard the story of Jehoshaphat? His people were about to be smashed to bits by a huge enemy army. Jehoshaphat didn’t hang about. He went straight to God and reminded Him, ‘You are so powerful that no one can defeat You’ (2 Chronicles 20:6 CEV), and God—through a prophet called Jahaziel—replied, ‘You won’t even have to fight... the Lord will be there with you.’ (2 Chronicles 20:17 CEV) Jehoshaphat led his army out to the battlefield, and told the worshippers to get right out there in front and sing praises to God. As soon as they started to sing, God did all the fighting on their behalf. He confused the opposition, and they began to wipe each other out. Nobody in Jehoshaphat’s army raised a weapon. Pretty soon ‘every soldier in the enemy’s army was lying dead on the ground.’ (2 Chronicles 20:24 CEV) As soon as you see an enemy on the horizon—whatever that might look like to you—don’t waste time. Seek God and worship him. See, worship requires you to look up to God. And if you’re looking up, you can’t navel–gaze (unless you’re one of those ‘gifted’ folk who can do multi–directional staring...) When you focus on His power instead of your problem, He moves on your behalf. So if you have a tendency to wallow, it would be a good idea to create an anti–navel–gazing playlist, and make your first port of call Psalm 42. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 13-15; John 1:43-51; Ps 131; Pro 26:7-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62226&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lead me, O Lord... make straight Your way before me.' Psalm 5:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever had the Sat-Nav take you to a dead–end street rather than the highway on–ramp you were expecting? Or failed to re–direct you off that one–way street or the access to the river? Do you still remember the smash or the splash? When it comes to the question of your life’s direction, you don’t want to rely on a dodgy Sat-Nav to steer you the right way. Here are a few navigation systems to avoid: (1) <em>Your emotions</em>. Very rarely will raw feelings about something point you down the right path. These powerful little hormone combos make up a large part of who we are, but emotions are also very changeable. Handle with care. (2) <em>Your mind</em>. Sometimes God’s direction just doesn’t seem logical at all. Rub mud into a man’s eyes and he’ll see (John 9:11). Throw your net down for the thousandth time, and you’ll finally catch some fish (John 21:5–6). Sounds a bit strange, right? Except, God says clearly, ‘My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts... My ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.’ (Isaiah 55:8 NLT) (3) <em>Well–meaning people</em>. When someone starts a sentence with ‘God told me to tell you that...’ resist the urge to take everything at face value immediately. (Or to dismiss it!) Whilst God absolutely does use people to deliver His messages, sometimes people get things wrong. Go to God for yourself. Ask Him. There’s a lot of stuff out there promising to show us the right way, when really what we need is a solid, close relationship with God and a hunger for his Word.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 16-18; John 2:1-11; Ps 23; Pro 26:10-12 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62228&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9.9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Unless you’ve got a specific calling to be single all your life, you’re probably hoping to get married at some point. And that’s totally fine because, in the first book of the Bible, God establishes that ‘It’s not good for the man to be alone.’ (Genesis 2:18 GWT) There are two unhelpful schools of thought about marriage running rampant in Christian culture right now:</p>
<p>(1) That God wants you to be perfectly happy being single and then (and only then) He’ll present you with the man/woman of your dreams and</p>
<p>(2) That you must find ‘the right person’ or ‘be the right person’ before you get married.</p>
<p>The first is wrong because although the Bible tells us to learn contentment in all situations, God knows our hearts’ desires and He isn’t a mean dad who withholds good things just for kicks. There is no magic formula your singleness will ‘unlock’. There is only His will, and the command for you to seek it. The second is wrong because your walk with God doesn’t end the moment you meet your future spouse. You must work to be the ‘right person’ every single day, primarily for God, but also because if both of you are doing that, your relationship will thrive. You don’t have to be a perfect person when you get married. Your spouse won’t be, that’s for sure. Read Galatians 5:22–23 and Corinthians 13:4–8 for some foundational truths about love and the spirit–filled life. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:22; Gen 39:1-23; Gen 45:1-11; Gen 50:15-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62229&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord corrects everyone He loves...' Proverbs 3:12 CEV<br /><br /><p>What does God’s correction look like? Back in the Old Testament, the consequences of messing up were steeeeeep. Plagues of locusts, rivers of frogs and pillars of salt, anyone? Jesus came so that, if we believe in Him, we don’t get punished like we deserve. But that doesn’t mean God sits idly by while we get on with crazy living. Correction, rather than punishment, is a sign of a God who loves us and wants the best for us. Sometimes correction might come in the form of direct consequence. If you get drunk and end up throwing up all over your new shoes, you might think again before drinking too much, right? Alternatively, correction might feel like a quiet spiritual prompting. A tiny voice inside that says, ‘Not that way...’ And you can choose—because you can always choose—whether or not you listen. Part of the point of being corrected is so that you don’t stay the same. Romans 12:2 NIV says ‘...be transformed by the renewing of your mind...’ and in 2 Corinthians 3:18, Paul says that we’re all ‘...being transformed...’ into God’s likeness. That process requires change, and—yes—correction. The key is to lift your gaze from your correction to His process. Take a moment today to think about the ways you feel God corrects you. Do you need to become more sensitive to His nudges? Could you do with learning from the consequences of a lesson you’ve repeated over and over? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 19-21; John 2:12-25; Ps 110; Pro 26:13-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62230&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Does God Really Heal?]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord, who heals you.' Exodus 15:26 NIV <br /><br /><p>Does God really heal? Let’s cut to the chase: God calls Himself a healer, Jesus spent a lot of miracle–hours healing people, the Holy Spirit is more powerful and loving that we can even begin to imagine. So we can safely say that yes—God can and does heal people today. But that’s really easy to say before someone we love gets diagnosed with cancer, or the doctor says we’re injured beyond repair. Believing in God for healing is a whole other ballgame when facing sickness head–on. And then there are the healings that don’t ever come: the times when our faith gets shaken out and thumped hard because we just don’t understand why. So we wrestle with the idea that God is still good and powerful when it feels like He’s nowhere. And we wonder if we prayed the ‘wrong way’, or not enough. And all the while the pain of disappointment sits on our chest like a double–decker bus... There is a choice to be made. Either God is a liar, or He’s telling the truth. If He’s telling the truth, then perhaps our perception of healing is incomplete. Perhaps it’s possible to face sickness, and still know total peace—and even joy. Perhaps, when it feels like God’s ignoring you, He’s actually healing the stuff that’s unseen. Here’s a thought from CS Lewis: ‘God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain. It is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.’ Is He whispering, speaking or shouting to you today? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 22-24; John 3:1-21; Ps 89:1-14; Pro 26:17-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62231&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They are...to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share...so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.' 1 Timothy 6:18-19 ESV<br /><br /><p>How rich do you want to be? You might have ambitions to be a millionaire or even just to be ‘comfortable’, but have you considered what the Bible says about you and money? For a start, nothing we possess actually belongs to us: it’s all God’s (Psalm 24:1). So no matter how hard you struggle to acquire more, you’re still only ever the caretaker of it. That truth is actually really freeing: it means that the pressure is off. You’re not defined by the size of your bank account and you can start trusting God to bless you so you have enough to give to others, without sorrow for yourself. (Proverbs 10:22) God’s hugely keen on stewardship—that is, the way you manage the stuff He gives you. Are you stingy? Are you reckless? Are you self–centred when it comes to money? Don’t expect Him to bless you with very much of it then. The Bible is clear about generosity. It’s also clear about taking responsibility: in Luke 16:11, Jesus says that, if you can’t be trusted with worldly wealth, you won’t be trusted with ‘true riches’. What have you been given? You might have a job, a part–time job or an allowance; whatever it is, you’ve been entrusted with it. So start thinking about ways you can be generous with it. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 25-27; John 3:22-36; Ps 89:15-37; Pro 26:20-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62232&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If we receive God's approval by obeying the laws in the Scriptures, then Christ's death was pointless.' Galatians 2:21 GWT<br /><br /><p>Grace (the undeserved love that God gives us) doesn’t give anyone permission to live as they please just saying: ‘God loves me so it doesn’t matter’ but the ‘judgmentalism’ that comes from insisting others live by our standards has caused untold damage. Chuck Swindoll writes, ‘Legalism spreads a paralysing venom... blinds our eyes, dulls our edge and arouses pride in our heart... Love is overshadowed by a mental clipboard with a long check–list... requiring others to measure up... Soon friendship is fractured by a judgmental attitude and a critical look.’ Think you’re not guilty? Check out your own attitude when you meet another Christian who doesn’t think, act or dress the way you do. You might break out a fake smile to disguise your real feelings but what is your head thinking? It doesn’t take long before your mouth is talking! Jesus said, ‘Never criticise... or it will all come back on you.’ (Luke 6:37 TLB) When you throw mud you don’t just get your hands dirty, you lose ground! ‘If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.’ (John 8:7 NIV) Blowing another person’s light out won’t make yours shine brighter. Paul writes: ‘If we receive God’s approval by obeying the laws in the Scriptures, then Christ’s death was pointless.’ You say, ‘What if someone is deliberately sinning?’ Paul answers: ‘...humbly help that person back onto the right path... be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.’ (Galatians 6:1 NLT) It’s good that we try to live God’s way but it isn’t a competition. Build people up, don’t knock them down and show them the grace that God has shown you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 28-29; John 4:1-12; Ps 89:38-52; Pro 26:23-26 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62233&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The reason you don't have what you want is... you don't ask God.' James 4:2 TLB<br /><br /><p>Imagine walking into your local Chinese takeaway and asking if your order is ready. ‘When did you phone it in?’ the server asks. ‘Oh I didn’t,’ you reply, ‘I just thought perhaps you’d have something with my name on it.’ Sound ridiculous? No more so than expecting God to answer requests you haven’t made. The book of James says, ‘The reason you don’t have what you want is... you don’t ask God.’ Does that mean He’ll automatically give you everything you ask for? No. James adds, ‘Even when you do ask you don’t get it because... you want only what will give you pleasure.’ (James 4:3 TLB) Your motives need to be in tune with what God knows is best for you. John says, ‘This is the confidence... we have in Him... if we ask anything... according to His will...He...hears.’ (1 John 5:14 AMP) Lamentations 3:25 AMP says, ‘The Lord is good to those who wait... expectantly for Him.’ Expectant prayer demonstrates confidence in God’s goodness. Instead of stressing out and taking matters into your own hands, say, ‘Lord, I’m going to trust you with this, no matter what happens,’ so He can honour your faith. Do you need a job? Help overcoming a problem? Do your friends or family need to become Christians? Need a deeper walk with God? Do you need physical or emotional healing? Jesus said, ‘It gives your Father great happiness to give you the [benefits of His] Kingdom.’ (Luke 12:32 NLT) God wants to be good to you, so tell Him the ‘desires of your heart’. (Psalm 37:4 NKJ) Thank Him that the answer will come in His time! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 30-32; John 4:13-26; Ps 100; Pro 26:27-28 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62234&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Always full of the joy of the Lord, and always thankful.' Colossians 1:11-12 TLB<br /><br /><p>Once there was an old and very wise man. Every day he and his granddaughter would sit outside a petrol station in his rocking chair, waiting to greet tourists as they passed through their small town. One day a tall man, who surely had to be a tourist, began looking around as if he were checking out the area for a place to live. ‘So what kind of town is this?’ he asked. The old man replied, ‘Well, what kinda town are you from?’ The tourist said, ‘One where everyone is very critical of each other. It’s a real negative place to live.’ The old man said: ‘Well, y’know, that’s just how this town is.’ Later, a family passing through also stopped for petrol. The father stepped out and asked the old man, ‘Is this town a good place to live?’ He replied, ‘Well, what about the town you’re from?’ The father said, ‘In the town I’m from everyone is very close and always willing to lend a helping hand. I really hate to leave it.’ The old man smiled and said, ‘Well, y’know, that’s a lot like this town.’ After the family had left the granddaughter looked up and asked, ‘Grandpa, how come when the first man came you told him this was a terrible place to live, yet when that family came you told them it was wonderful?’ The old man looked down into his granddaughter’s wondering blue eyes and said, ‘No matter where you go, you take your attitude with you. And that’s what makes it terrible or wonderful.’ Life is what you make it! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 33-35; John 4:27-38; Ps 32; Pro 27:1-3 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62235&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him.' (2 Corinthians 5:18 NLT)<br /><br /><p>Reconciliation. Restoring relationships. That’s what the Cross does. It changes everything. The moment we give ourselves fully over to God because of that Cross, life changes completely. Nothing will ever be the same again. And if we think that stops at us, we’re totally wrong. What starts in our individual lives has a ripple effect, out into the lives of others. Pastor Matt Chandler puts it like this: ‘Think of the Gospel as a stone landing in a pond. The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus are the cause of many ripples; they are the epicentre of God’s work in the world.’ And he reckons the ripples go out like this: (1) The first restores our personal relationship with God. (2) The second helps us restore and create human–to–human relationships to make up the worldwide Church. (3) The third ripple happens when we move ourselves out and take the message of Jesus to those who are not yet a part of the Church. Essentially, what he’s saying is that God ‘reconciles’ us to Himself, and that makes us able to go out and let Him use us to restore other people’s relationships with Him. Once we’re brought back into that beautiful relationship with God, it only makes sense to share that with those around us. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 13:21-22; 1 Sam 16; 1 Sam 17:32-51; 1 Sam 24:1-17<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62236&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I saw the Lord sitting on a throne...' Isaiah 6:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It’s absolutely impossible to have a real encounter with God and not be changed by it. Just look at Isaiah, and in particular Isaiah 6:1–5. After meeting with God, Isaiah said, ‘Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King.’ (Isaiah 6:1–5 NKJV) Heavy, yes. But the point is, Isaiah’s entire outlook turned around after one encounter with God. The guy was ‘undone’! You see, as soon as Isaiah gets a glimpse of God’s holiness, he immediately understands himself and his own mistakes. Butcher–turned–writer Simon Ponsonby puts it like this: ‘God doesn’t tell Isaiah he is sinful—He doesn’t need to. As light reveals darkness, God’s holiness exposes man’s sinfulness… he never saw it before, but then he had never seen God before.’ It all starts with seeing, with light coming to shine into darkness. That’s why it’s good to confess our mistakes to God and, in some circumstances, to other trustworthy Christians—asking God to shine that light, and allowing others to see it can help a whole lot. This is one of the (not–so–secret) secrets of finding a way past sin, and making positive changes to become more like Jesus. We all prefer others to see our ‘wow’ rather than our ‘woe’, but letting God shine a light into our darkest places is essential for our holiness. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 36-38; John 4:39-54; Ps 87; Pro 27:4-6 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62237&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['How long, O Lord, must I call for help?...' Habakkuk 1:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>There’s one very good word you could use to define the Christian view of the world: ‘waiting’. This whole crumbling creation is waiting for the day Jesus returns and sets things straight once and for all. But in our own lives too, there’s often an agonising amount of waiting. Perhaps you’re waiting for an answer to a prayer? A breakthrough in a painful situation you’re facing? Mr or Ms Right? Well, you’re not the first person to struggle with the idea of waiting, and you won’t be the last. God said to the prophet Habakkuk, ‘The revelation awaits an appointed time … and will not prove false. Though it lingers, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.’ (Habakkuk 2:3 NIV) Why did God say that? Well, it was a direct answer to Habakkuk’s question, ‘How long, O Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen?’ Waiting is never easy. So what should we do? Make it active waiting: pour yourself into the job at hand; otherwise you’ll short–change your own future. Even if it feels like all you’re doing is standing on God’s promises, waiting for change, keep at it. Sighing and resorting to twiddling your thumbs won’t go towards anything. James writes, ‘Be patient… See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm.’ (James 5:7–8 NIV) So: next time you’re in a queue, make use of that time. Pick a person out, and silently pray for them the whole time you’re waiting. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 39-40; John 5:1-15; Ps 41; Pro 27:7-9 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62238&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will wait, 'til my change comes.' Job 14:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Sometimes the most helpful advice for living comes from the natural world. A mud–covered and unnoticed seed becomes a giant, fruit–bearing plant after weeks in the dark, suffocating underground. Then the shoot that forms must force its way out to be seen by everyone for its beauty. It’s not quick, and it’s probably not much fun for the seed. The same is true for your life in God: when you don’t rush His purpose in your life, the results will be powerful, and unexpectedly good. Perhaps you’re thinking, ‘I can’t wait for this (job contract / school term / illness / loneliness / unemployment* (*delete as applicable) to be over.’ That’s understandable—Job couldn’t either. He said, ‘All the days of my hard service I will wait, ’til my change comes.’ But by God’s grace he made it, and ended up with twice as much as he lost. Twice as much. So hold on, your change is coming. God won’t give up on you, so don’t give up on Him. He’s working through you as we speak, you know... Perhaps something is ending that has to end, so that something better can come through. God never disappoints; don’t look at what’s going around you without seeing it through His eyes. Ecclesiastes 3:1 tells us there is a right time for all things and a season for every activity—including waiting! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 1-3; John 5:16-30; Ps 15; Pro 27:10-12 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62239&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go to the land I will show you ... and I will bless you.' Genesis 12:1-2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nobody likes to be the first to arrive at a party, and it’s a brave thing to show up alone to an event where you might not know anyone. Most of us chicken out and try to pitch up with at least one other friend (or lurk in the doorway till we see a familiar face...) What is it we’re so afraid of? Looking like a fool or a Billy–no–mates? Maybe it’s the fear that our friend might not show up at all. If we’re honest, we sometimes think God might leave us hanging too. What if I go and You don’t come through for me? But if God’s called you to go, you can be sure He will show. In fact, He won’t just turn up, He’ll get there before you do. Abraham discovered this to be true: ‘By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.’ (Hebrews 11:8 NIV) Read his story and you’ll see how God went ahead of him, working things out for him and his family, rearranging circumstances to his advantage. Here’s a verse to copy into the front of your Bible: ‘I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.’ (Isaiah 48:17 NIV)</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Isa 4-7; John 5:31-47; Ps 5; Pro 27:13-16 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62240&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus told His disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up.' Luke 18:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>A key part of prayer is persistence. Often, it’s not enough simply to ask. God doesn’t want us to be afraid we’re being rude if we keep on asking. How do we know? Jesus told a story about a widow who’d been in a dispute with an enemy. She approached a judge to get him to intervene. The judge couldn’t have cared less about her case. But she decided she wasn’t giving up pleading with him. Finally he gave in. ‘I’m going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!’ (Luke 18:5 NLT) What a great attitude to prayer, right? Never giving up? But wait… what about that judge? He sounds a little off. Does this story mean God is indifferent to our needs? Does He really care about us, or does He only give in because we’ve nagged Him enough? Not at all. Jesus made his story’s judge unjust to make exactly this point: if this tired, grumpy old man gives in, ‘...don’t you think God will surely give justice to His chosen people who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off?’ (Luke 18:7 NLT) Remember this is God in Heaven, who loves to see you blessed. If you don’t see an answer to prayer, keep asking Him. He’s not reluctant to answer you, but He’s working things to give you the very best, and wants you to get even closer in the meantime. When you pray, don’t prepare yourself for a weary battle against a distant, half–hearted God. Go with confidence He’ll answer. God is willing and is waiting. Pray and pray again for something you’ve given up on. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 8-11; John 6:1-24; Ps 126; Pro 27:17-19 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62241&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Holy Spirit... will teach you all things...' John 14:26 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Did you ever have a teacher who carried around a chipped, coffee–stained World’s Best Teacher mug? The real World’s Best Teacher doesn’t carry around any sort of mug. According to Jesus, the WBT is the Holy Spirit. And there’s two good reasons why. (1) His tuition is one–on–one personal. He doesn’t mind your questions or your mistakes, He’s there to help every step of the way. (2) He has full knowledge about you, your past and your future. And He wants to clean up your past so your future is a blessing to yourself and others. He has the perfect solution to every problem you face. He knows exactly how to turn around a nightmare scenario into a win–win. But unlike a school teacher, He won’t demand that you pay attention. If you want to be a disciple (or ‘learner’) of Jesus, you need to show up every day for class, not just every once in a while. It means you have to listen intently, do the reading assignments and take notes. It means trusting that the Teacher knows what He’s talking about even if you don’t see how what He’s telling you right now relates to you personally. The Holy Spirit doesn’t make mistakes: what seems irrelevant now may be just what you need tomorrow. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 12-16; John 6:25-34; Ps 85; Pro 27:20-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62242&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Spirit will... make it known to you.' John 16:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Asked what makes a good teacher, William Arthur Ward wrote: ‘The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.’ The very best teachers are not the ones who just tell you what they think you need to know. They are the ones who explain it and demonstrate in such a way that it leaves you utterly inspired. This is what Jesus did for His disciples (remember, the word disciple literally means ‘learner’ or ‘student’). In Jesus’ day, disciples not only learned from listening to a rabbi, but also by observing and experiencing his way of life from every angle. In the same way, Jesus invited His twelve mates into (almost) every part of his life for three years. They knew Him intimately. It meant that, when the time finally came, they were ready. He could say to them, ‘...[you] will do the same works I have done, and even greater.’ (John 14:12 NLT) True discipleship is a 360–degree thing. There should be people you are learning from (those a little further along than you), people you are learning with (those of a similar level of maturity to you), and people who are learning from you. The Spirit will reveal the life of God to you in different ways through all of these relationships. And that’s the important thing—relationships. If you’re not part of a community of Christians, how can you be learning from them or learning with them? Not sure where a church is in your area? Go to www.word4U2day.com.au/Church-Search and pray the Holy Spirit will direct you to the right place. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1:8-18; Ruth 2:5-12; Ruth 3:1-6; Ruth 4:9-13 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62243&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus saw her... and said, &quot;Dear woman, you are healed of your sickness!&quot;' Luke 13:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Today, we get to see Jesus doing what He loves to do: healing and setting people free. Luke 13:10–14 NLT says, ‘As Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, He saw a woman who had been… bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight… He called her over and… touched her, and instantly she could stand straight. How she praised God! But the leader… was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day. “There are six days of the week for working,” he said to the crowd. “Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath.”’ This woman had suffered for nearly two decades from an evil spirit that was keeping her hunched over and looking down at the ground. But Jesus found her in the synagogue, so perhaps she hadn’t yet given up hope God would heal her. Wonderfully, that’s exactly what He does: without waiting to be asked, Jesus compassionately calls her over and releases her with a word and a touch. It’s telling that Jesus accomplished in seconds what eighteen years of religion had failed to do for this woman. That’s because the kind of religion which majors only on rule–keeping has no power in itself—it relies on controlling the crowd, like the synagogue leader in this account. Run from religion like this. Consider: is it possible to do ‘spiritual’ things (such as going to church, reading the Bible or praying) with a legalistic, rule–keeping mindset which actually stops us from meeting with Jesus? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 17-21; John 6:35-51; Ps 98; Pro 27:23-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62244&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[god-is-beyond-beautiful]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Your beauty should come from within you.' 1 Peter 3:4 NCV<br /><br /><p>A long time ago (in a galaxy, well, here) Jonathan Edwards wrote this: ‘But saints and angels behold that glory of God which consists in the beauty of His holiness; and it is this sight only that will melt and humble the hearts of men, wean them from the world, draw them to God, and effectually change them.’ We don’t often think of ‘holiness’ as being something that makes you beautiful. But if your life is rooted in God that much, then what else can give beauty to it? Only your relationship with Jesus defines you. Only God pieces you together, with all the care and attention in the world. Only His plans forge your path. Only His beauty, deep as oceans and huge as mountains, counts. It’s the only beauty that can stir up something far–down in a human soul. God is beyond beautiful. He is sublime, wondrous, so stupendously gorgeous it’s enough to make normal humans afraid. And He made us to reflect Himself. For Christians, that’s hardwired into our spiritual DNA. We can say: You. Are. Beautiful. God–defined beautiful. And that carries strength. God has placed some of His deep, light–filled power in you, enough to make dark ugliness flee. When that’s inside, what does the outside matter? Outward looks make very little difference. Your God–filled heart is what will show the world there is a higher, purer, perfect Beauty. And, when it does, it’s your job to tell the world that the Beauty’s name is Jesus. Fiery, Jesus–focused souls are what change the world.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Isa 22-25; John 6:52-71; Ps 127; Pro 27:25-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62245&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If God is for us, who can ever be against us?' Romans 8:31 NLT<br /><br /><p>Faith is like a muscle; using it may cause a strain but in the end it grows stronger. David (the bloke who wrote all those Psalms and killed Goliath) totally understood this. He was always getting into trouble but instead of losing faith in God’s promise, David understood that, ‘The Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself.’ (Psalm 4:3 NAS) So he said, ‘In peace I will...lie down... for You...Lord, make me to dwell in safety.’ (Psalm 4:8 NAS) Even when he was captured by the Philistines he prayed, ‘When I am afraid, I will...trust in You.’ (Psalm 56:3 NAS) When he ended up in a cave after escaping from a very angry King Saul, he said, ‘I will hide beneath the shadow of Your wings until this...is past.’ (Psalm 57:1 TLB) During the third century, when Felix of Nola was running from his enemies, he and a friend hid in a cave. A spider began to weave a web across the small opening, sealing it off and making it look like nobody had been inside for months. As a result the guys hunting him didn’t even bother to go in. Later, stepping out into the sunshine, Felix declared, ‘Where God is, a spider’s web is a wall. And where He isn’t, a wall is but a spider’s web.’ Jesus said you’d have problems on earth; people will disappoint you and you’ll disappoint yourself. Sometimes you’ll end up in a cave because of something you did, other times because of circumstances you’d no control over but God is with you either way. Like Paul said, ‘If God is for us, who can ever be against us?’</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Isa 26-29; John 7:1-13; Ps 114; Pro 28:1-4 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62246&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Job...fell to the ground and worshipped.' Job 1:20 NAS<br /><br /><p>Job had a seriously bad week. Thieves came and stole everything of value; all his kids died when they were at a party and the building collapsed on top of them; he fell agonisingly ill. But his attitude to it all? He worshipped God! Every day God sends us opportunities to grow spiritually, disguised as problems! After losing everything, ‘...Job... got up and tore his robe and shaved his head to show how sad he was. Then he bowed down... to worship God.’ That’s not the normal human response to tragedy, is it? Job didn’t react that way because he understood what was happening or because he was crazy. Despite his sadness, he worshipped God. He was able to respond that way because: (a) he looked inside! He knew God was teaching him something really valuable: ‘When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.’ (Job 23:10 NAS) (b) he looked forward! He reminded himself it’s all going work out when we stick with God. (c) he looked up! In the middle of a nightmare, Job saw the God who promised to direct each step we take. More importantly, he trusted God’s heart of love. Don’t make the mistake of thinking it was easier for Job to trust God than it is for you. Remember, Jesus hadn’t even been born at that point so He didn’t even have the same proof of God’s love as we do! So what should you do when troubles multiply? Look in, look forward and most of all look upwards! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 30-33; John 7:14-24; Ps 104:1-23; Pro 28:5-8 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62247&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we can come before God with freedom and without fear. We can do this through faith in Christ.' Ephesians 3:12 NCV<br /><br /><p>When you walk by faith God will test you like he tested Elijah! The prophet was sitting alone beside a dried–up stream when God sent him on a 160km hike through the desert to Zarephath. At the time Elijah was a wanted man, so coming out of hiding meant really trusting God for his safety. Next, God told him that, when he got there a poor widow, would provide for him. Elijah found the widow in the middle of a famine, cooking her last meal with her last bit of food; a bit depressing! Elijah challenged her to obey God, promising: ‘There will always be plenty of flour and olive oil...in your containers until...the Lord sends rain and the crops grow.’ (1 Kings 17:14 NLT) Why on earth did Elijah have the confidence to say that to a broke widow during a famine? He had lived a life of faith and proved God to be faithful! You can talk that way when you walk that way! Rubbing shoulders with people who trust God is contagious, it builds your faith. This woman was no exception. She and her son may not have eaten fine cuisine every night but God made sure that as long as the famine lasted they had all they needed. So if you don’t have everything you want right now, give God what you’ve got and trust that, when the time is right, He’ll look after you. Paul says, ‘...we can come before God with freedom and without fear.’ So wherever God is directing you, even if it’s somewhere that doesn’t make sense to you right now, don’t argue. Go, and remember His promises—they will strengthen your faith to believe in Him for all your needs.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 18:9-18; Dan 2; Isa 47:5-15; Acts 16:16-34 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62249&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him...' Luke 24:31 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You’ve read the book <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em>? Or seen the movie <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Voyage of the ‘Dawn Treader’</em>? The Christian themes are pretty obvious, huh? Yet the author CS Lewis was once a hardcore atheist and wrote tracts defending it. He said, ‘I maintained God did not exist. I was also angry with God for not existing.’ Then two friends of his, JRR Tolkien (yup, the guy who wrote <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lord of The Rings</em>) and HVD Dyson, both devout followers of Jesus, urged him to do something he’d never done before: read the Bible.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So he did. He began to wrestle with the things Jesus said. And eventually he came to a realisation: Jesus was either a loony, or a brilliant conman, or exactly who He claimed to be. No other options. There was a big jump to concluding Jesus was the Son of God, and Lewis knew it.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>He talked it through with his friends. There was no denying it, the Bible made massive claims about truth and reality. One evening he and friends took a long walk and chatted late into the night. Soon afterwards, Lewis became a believer. Eventually he was so famous the Atheist Society had to stop using those tracts he wrote. His world turned around and, as a result, so did the worlds of millions of readers. Could it be this simple? Could the chasm between doubt and faith be spanned with just the Bible and Christian friends?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>If you know friends questioning God or interrogating faith right now—don’t write them off! Talk to God about the questions you can ask them to help them work things through.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 34-37, Jn 7:25-44, Ps 104:24-35, Prov 28:9-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63436&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...do it all in the name of the Lord...' Colossians 3:17 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘Look out for number one.’ That’s such great advice for life, yeah?? (Shakes head.) So, how about we remind ourselves that Jesus ‘did not please Himself.’ (Romans 15:3 NIV) You won’t find a shred of selfishness in Him.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ivan O Miller said, ‘Humility is such a frail and delicate thing that he who dares to think that he has it, proves by that single thought that he has it not.’ So, the challenge that he sets out is: how much can you forget about yourself so that you can put others first?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Sound a bit harsh? Inhuman? Perhaps it’s a way to enjoy life without obsessing over yourself. When you succeed and the pats–on–the–back start coming your way, enjoy them briefly, and then pass the accolades on to the true source of all your accomplishments. Where your mind is singing to itself about how great you are, get re–tuned. Do it in the name of the Lord Jesus—actually, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus</em>.’ (Colossians 3:17 NIV)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>There’s an aim and a half! Kick off, today, with something small so that one day, you’ll be able to say that ‘whatever’ you do is done for God. Remember: pride brought Satan down. It’ll burn us to the ground too if we let it. So start today with an act of praise to God. End today with one too. And see how many times you can do the same in the middle.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 9:1-19, 2 Cor 11:21-33, 2 Cor 12:7-10, Phil 3:4-14  <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63437&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a time for everything.' Ecclesiastes 3:1 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Cleaningroster–setupteam–worshippractice–missionsweek–prayermeeting–home–sleep–zzz. Sound familiar? Sometimes it’s hard to say ‘no’ because as a Christian you feel obligated to do everything you’re asked. But not every ‘need’ is an order from God to jump in and meet it.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Urgency is stressful. It’s also addictive, so if you find yourself always reacting to outside demands, check that you’re not hooked. Like any addiction, urgency meets your need to feel needed—for a while, anyway. It may make you feel satisfied, but it will bite back.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It creates a sense you’re getting important tasks done, falsely inflates your self–esteem, but tends to make stuff worse because mostly ‘haste makes waste’. You weren’t made for urgency. Jumping from one task to the next without being rested or centred breaks up your personality. Too much and you’ll probably struggle with sleep. We have to find space for ourselves, not in a selfish, me–first way, but to get settled in our home in God and get our hearts rested. There is a time for everything, but, not everything has to happen all the time! Walker Percy said, ‘You can get all A’s and still flunk life.’ Try to be discerning about the tasks you need to do and the tasks that will only drain you. Ask God to help you make a list of the ‘must do’ tasks in life. Then ask Him to help you prioritise the list—and stick to it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 38-41, Jn 7:45-53, Ps 9, Prov 28:13-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63440&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...To him who knows to do good and does not do it...it is sin.' James 4:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We spend a large chunk of our time at church/youth groups/home groups/this magazine talking about honouring God by not making wrong choices (which, for hopefully obvious reasons, is a decent shout). The wrong we do holds us back from knowing God. Yet, Jesus focussed a lot on something a little different: the good we fail to do. And THAT can be a touchy subject. Not something Jesus wanted to shy away from, though. The servant who buried his resources (Luke 16:19–24), and the barren fig tree (Mark 11:20–24) are examples of Jesus calling out procrastination, laziness, unwillingness and the like.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And guess what? We’re not free from that, either. How many times have you caught yourself killing productive–time by scrolling down that news feed, and forgetting exactly why you opened up Facebook in the first place? We reckon we’ve all done something similar. And if that’s true; we’re probably fairly prone to larger–scale laziness.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s fair to say you might not have got it all together yet, and you need to get to know God better. But at the end of the day (and at the start/middle, too)—the way to get a deep spiritual life is to look out for ways to serve others, and don’t think twice: get straight to it. (Worried that you aren’t doing these things? Your works for God aren’t the way you get saved, but it’s definitely time to consider thanking Him through your works.)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will bless the Lord at all times.' Psalm 34:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Milieu therapy is pretty cool. It’s a type of therapy that puts the patient into a new living environment, changing their surroundings in order to make room for a healthier life to grow. So here’s today’s idea: worship can change your surroundings.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>A century ago GK Chesterton put it like this: ‘You say grace before meals. All right. But I say grace before the concert and the opera, and grace before the play and pantomime, and grace before I open a book, and grace before sketching, painting, swimming, fencing, boxing, walking, playing, dancing and grace before I dip the pen in the ink.’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Hmm... which kinda translates as: ‘...grace before Facebook, grace before YouTube, before Instagram, before movies, before texting...’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Sometimes you don’t feel like praising God. But feelings don’t have to always fill praise, and a good relationship isn’t based on emotion but on commitment. A songwriter in the Bible said, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>From the rising of the sun to its going down, the Lord’s name is to be praised</em>.’ (Psalm 113:3 NKJ) They scheduled praisebreaks throughout their day: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Seven times a day I praise You</em>.’ (Psalm 119:164 NKJ) What if, every time you stopped for a break (tea, coffee or chocolate), you took time to praise God too? If you want to change your environment and your attitude, start praising God throughout the day. Try it and see. Eventually the emotions and feelings may come along and make the praise spontaneous and just flowing out of you, just like Chesterton.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 42-44, Jn 8:1-13, Ps 96, Prov 28:17-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63441&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.' Psalm 150:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>When it’s time to praise God you should give it 100 percent: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart.</em>’ (Psalm 9:1 NKJ) The story’s told of an old man named Joe, who’d been a drunk and a derelict most of his life and, as a result, he could barely make ends meet. During a Sunday morning service he gave his life to Christ and the transformation was so radical that everybody in the congregation noticed it. Joe had a problem, however. He was just so thrilled with Jesus that he sang louder than everybody else. And when the pastor made a point that touched his heart, he’d jump up and shout, ‘Hallelujah!’ Concerned that the interruptions were drawing attention more to Joe than God, the pastor said, ‘Joe, you’ve got to be quiet. As a matter of fact, if you’ll just sit in church next Sunday and say nothing, I’ll buy you a new pair of boots.’ Joe needed those boots, so he said he’d try. But after restraining himself through several high points in the sermon, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He jumped up and shouted, ‘Boots or no boots, I’m gonna praise the Lord!’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Are you holding back because you feel shy? Sorry, God doesn’t make exceptions based on personality types. ‘Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!’ In other words, unless you’re dead, you’re supposed to praise the Lord! Not because He needs it! But because He comes to dwell within the praise you give Him. (Psalm 22:3) Want to be closer to Jesus? Just open your mouth in praise!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 45-48, Jn 8:14-30, Ps 86, Prov 28:21-24 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63442&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.' John 18:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You think Jesus never had any embarrassing moments? What about when Mary and Joseph interrupted Him as a twelve-year-old, sitting in the temple dazzling its best scholars. (Luke 2:48) They scuttled Him off, saying, ‘We thought we’d lost you. You had us worried to death.’ Or what about the time He stood up in His home church to announce He was the prophesied One and the neighbours tried to throw Him off a cliff? (Luke 4:29) Or the occasion when He told Jairus his daughter wasn’t dead but sleeping and everyone ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>laughed him to scorn</em>’? (Matthew 9:24 KJV) Now think about this. When the high priest asked Jesus about His doctrine, He replied, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me…</em>’ (John 18:21 NKJ) One of the officers nearby slapped Him in the face. That’s embarrassing! But the supreme embarrassment in the life of Jesus may well have been when the high priest asked Him about His disciples. Where were they? Judas betrayed Him, Peter denied Him, and the rest ran for cover. What could He say? More importantly, what can He say about you?<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>Are your character and your behaviour a reason for angels to rejoice or an embarrassment to Jesus? Gandhi said, ‘If Christians would really live according to the teachings of Christ, all of India would be Christian today.’ When it comes to what you believe about Jesus, you may stand tall. But when that belief translates into behaviour, where do you stand?<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>Dishonouring Him or as His disciple?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 49-52, Jn 8:31-41, Ps 30, Prov 28:25-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63443&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have a good conscience, in all things...' Hebrews 13:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Your conscience works on the same principle as a fire alarm—the rest of the house might be asleep, but when the fire alarm kicks off everyone should be bounding up and paying attention. And when sin obstructs the connection between you and God, your conscience will be the thing that signals something’s going wrong. At that moment you don’t rub your eyes blearily and rouse yourself grumbling. No, you should be lively, alert, and sprinting.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You can develop the ability to sleep through sin–alarms, of course. And it can be quite tempting to hit the snooze button, because no one likes being called out on something they’re doing. But actually, let yourself feel good about the sin–alarms. It means your conscience is alive—and the Holy Spirit will never use it to crush us with shame, but to encourage us to do better. The Holy Spirit is really important here—He’s the one who engineers the conscience to guide you from continuing down that path. So foster that feeling, and listen to Him. And if you plough on regardless, like trying to sleep through a house fire, your conscience will stop you from being at ease with your decision. Don’t wait until there’s smoke in the air. Don’t wait until you can taste house fire in your mouth.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You will likely still have blind spots about certain sins. So alongside your conscience, remember that God puts other Christians around you so that He can speak to you through them. Think about people who you can trust to offer godly advice and make it a priority to connect with them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 53-57, Jn 8:42-59, Ps 123, Prov 29:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63444&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Keep your tongue from evil...' Psalm 34:13 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You know the feeling. You’re walking along, not quite paying attention, and your foot goes straight into a little pile that some prized poodle’s owner failed to clean up. Walk that through a doorway and the whole household will soon let you know about it. Yet, we can bring something just as dirty and smelly into a room and it’s so much harder to notice: and that thing that’s ‘on the nose’ is gossip.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Think about the mess you’re likely to make with gossip. Ask yourself, ‘Who’s going to benefit from me saying this stuff?’ ‘Who am I going to hurt?’ ‘Whose confidence am I betraying?’ If it has the potential to cause a stink, leave it outside. Don’t drag potentially hurtful half–truth into your house. Clean your shoes and your conscience, at the door.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>James 1:26 NIV implies that ‘gossip’ is a stain on our spiritual lives: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless</em>.’ Solomon warns us that we will eat the effects of our unwise words: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit.</em>’ (Proverbs 18:21 NIV) And just in case we need it spelt out further, 1 Peter 3:10 NIV tells us, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil</em>.’ Words can run away from you, and get out of hand. Don’t let it happen. Ask the Lord to help you if you have a problem with gossiping.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 58-62, Jn 9:1-12, Ps 15, Prov 29:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63445&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His...riches...in the saints.' Ephesians 1:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Paul wasn’t meaning to sound like a financial adviser when he prayed the Ephesian church would understand the riches He had ‘invested’ in them. No, he was helping them to get a grip on why God had lavished so many extravagant gifts on them. The point of God’s generous investment is that He sees the potential for something great to grow.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God is in the entrepreneurial game. Not to make us self–centred, gifted busybodies (although He wants us to feel good about our gifts—He knows what we’re like). But He uses us to serve the world. If our skill is business and making money, then through us God can bless the poor. If our talent is care and tasty–food–making, then through us God can welcome and feed the lonely. If our gift is teaching, then God can show the world what His character is like. That’s what our skills are for—to make the world more like one where God rules and cares for everybody.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s why in other places in the Bible it talks about God giving us an ‘inheritance’. It’s a little mind–bending, but the (very) serious suggestion is that we’re to take part in God’s rule over the earth. The inheritance is Himself. The gifts He gives us aren’t coincidences—they are a part of His character. We are the means by which He looks over and tends for this planet. And doesn’t that just blow your mind? Read the whole of the parable of the talents in Matthew 25. Maybe have a quick scan over the things people have said you’re good at. Do any of them seem like ‘talents’?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 1, Job 2:7-10, Job 40:1-5, Job 42:7-17   <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63446&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Lord, teach us to pray...' Luke 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Jesus didn’t give us <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lord’s Prayer</em> as an automatic plug–in. Yes, it’s a ready–made prayer, but it’s not made so that we don’t have to think about what we’re saying. Jesus understands how we’re wired inside. He knows we can be tempted to love what He can do for us more than loving Him for who He is.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The Lord’s Prayer re–points us to God first, starts our focus with Him. That’s a pretty good way for us to get a good perspective on our issues. William Barclay points out that <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lord’s Prayer</em> ‘…has two major parts: the first for God’s benefit, the second for ours. Honour the first part, and the second is guaranteed.’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Part one begins with ‘Our Father’. We are not approaching Santa with our gift list—we are entering family. Family—coming with a responsibility to our brothers and sisters. Family—coming with security and benefits. ‘Our Father’ reminds us that what God says goes. <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lord’s Prayer</em> might feel like a packaged prayer, but it doesn’t mean we don’t think about it. The next few days we are going to turn our mind to <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lord’s Prayer</em>. Use the time to think about prayer in a rounded way. Over–familiarisation of famous Bible passages can dilute the meaning for us. Look up these famous words in a variety of translations online (Luke 11:2–4; Matthew 6:9–13). Or refresh the words by writing one of them out in your own words.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 63-66, Jn 9:13-23, Ps 115, Prov 29:7-10  <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63447&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...before the throne of our merciful God... we will find help.' Hebrews 4:16 CEV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘Our ruler in Heaven…’ or ‘Our Lord of the universe…’ Jesus could’ve begun like this. Both are theologically correct. Yet when He chooses to model His way of praying, He uses the words ‘Our Father.’ Not ruler. Not king. Not head–honcho. Daddy. That’s an even better translation than ‘father’. Jesus chose these words to remind us to think like family. We’re not orphans. We have a heavenly Daddy who loves us and expects us to love one another. So we have a responsibility to love our brothers and sisters. We are family, God’s family.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We have roles in this family—one is the role of sibling. Because of this, we should actively choose not to climb all over our brothers or sisters to get to the top of our profession—or even the head of the queue. Because of this, we should actively choose to care for others, like the hungry in our communities. This is the kind of family God adopts us into: a caring family, not a selfish one.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>As well as being siblings, we are also children. Jesus reminds us God is a good father—the best. He provides and accepts and loves, always. A father of compassion and comfort. We can always go to Him when we feel hurt by others. He’ll never let us down.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>When we’re rooted into that sort of family, and we’re getting what we need emotionally from God, that selfless love flows out of us. Right now, ask God to show you how He is a perfect Father to you. Then, reckon you can ask Him to give you one good opportunity to share this family love today?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 1:1-3:20, Jn 9:24-41, Ps 99, Prov 29:11-14  <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63448&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Is anything too hard for Me?' Jeremiah 32:27 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name</em>…’ ‘Hallowed’ is a way of describing God as holy. Or blessed. Or respected.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We’ve looked a little at God being our Father. But what if your experience of the word ‘Dad’ isn’t great? What if the word is loaded because Dad was distant or absent or let you down? Well this word ‘hallowed’ reminds us God is no ordinary dad. God is holy. This means He doesn’t let us down. God is unchanging. This means He isn’t influenced by moods and feelings. God is love. This means He doesn’t get interested only when it’s convenient. God has us on His mind constantly. He cares about us. He loves us with perfect love. And what’s more, God is the God of overcoming the impossible (ever read that bit about mustard seeds and moving mountains?)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So get this: the God who parted the Red Sea is your Dad. The God who was designing the Universe before it sparkled into existence out of nothing—yep, He’s your Dad. The God who scattered stars in the night, came up with ideas like sight and smell and sound, who knows the secret of the meaning of life—yep, He’s your Dad. Is anything impossible for your Dad? No! Nothing. ‘…<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Is anything too hard for Me?</em>’ God asked Jeremiah. That’s what we call a rhetorical question: one that doesn’t need an answer. Because we already know what it is.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Your Dad is all powerful God. There’s an incredible amount of safety in that.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 3:21-6:23, Jn 10:1-10, Ps 133, Prov 29:15-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63449&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give us each day our daily bread.' Luke 11:3 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The first part of <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Lord’s Prayer</em> puts things in perspective. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Our Father</em>…’ reminds us we are part of God’s family. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Hallowed be Your name</em>’ tells us God is no ordinary Dad—He is holy. To be respected. The God of the impossible. Next, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Your Kingdom come; Your will be done</em>…’ prompts us to put God’s way first. Nothing and nobody challenges God in Heaven. We’d do well to remember that too.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Now comes the second part. We start to remember ourselves. We approach God as His child and ask for His help: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Give us this day our daily bread</em>…’ The word Jesus used here literally meant <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>food</em>. In other words, give us our three square meals to keep us going. God cares for our everyday needs. Food to keep us fit and healthy. A home to keep us safe and warm. Friends and family to keep us loved and loving. Our daily ‘bread’ is all that makes life possible.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Our self–preservation instincts kick in too hard sometimes: What if I don’t get a job? What if I do, but I get the sack? What if I can’t afford to eat? What about bills? What if I never meet that perfect someone?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Well. God doesn’t promise anyone a millionaire mansion and matching Maserati with a supermodel in the passenger seat. But God knows just what you do need. And when you need it. And how it will be provided. So learn to trust Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 7:1-9:16, Jn 10:11-21, Ps 83:1-8, Prov 29:19-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63450&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will show you a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Forgive us our sins, just as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us</em>.’ (Matthew 6:12 NLT) God is holy. When we enter His presence, we soon realise we are not. Glossing over our mini–mistakes and little lapses might work in our own heads, but won’t get us anywhere with the God known as Righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30). Best be straight with Him: God isn’t waiting to rap you on the knuckles with a ruler. He’s waiting to restore you. To give you back your dignity. But He can’t sort the problem, if you’re denying it. Tell it straight and He’ll straighten you out. Guaranteed.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>There is a catch, though. You can’t get God’s forgiveness, if you won’t forgive others. Dad likes His house in order. He’s not impressed with backbiting children holding grudges against one another. If you want a clear mind, you’d better clear it with others too. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>If you forgive men… your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not… your Father will not forgive your sins</em>.’ (Matthew 6:14–15 NIV)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>This is as much for our benefit as for others. Carrying around a collection of hurts and insults is crippling. There is freedom for us when we let go. Somebody once said, ‘Forgiveness is letting go of the other man’s throat.’ But it is also letting go of our own throats.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>How about spending time right now owning up to God? Think of those people you’ve been grumbling/brooding about. Decide to fully, completely, overflowingly forgive them. If this seems hard, work it through with God’s help. Ask Him to help empower your will to work towards forgiveness, however long it takes.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 9:17-11:36, Jn 10:22-42, Ps 83:9-18, Prov 29:23-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63451&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[prayer-formula-6]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Deliver us from the evil one.' Matthew 6:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Lead us not into temptation</em>…’ seems a bit of an odd thing to pray. William Barclay argues that the word ‘temptation’ here is referring to the craving towards the wrong things in life. The compromises. The giving–in. God will never Himself tempt us. James 1:13 is clear about this: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>When tempted, no one should ever say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone</em>.’ The next line of the Lord’s Prayer implies where temptation actually comes from: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Deliver us from the evil one</em>.’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Evil one—what does this mean? Take a look at the state of the world—children forced to join armies; 27 million people trafficked into slavery; whole regions of nations starving; diseases spreading... and the list goes on—it is pretty obvious there is an evil in this world. Some people try to ignore evil, hoping it will ignore them. But we need to be aware of it.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil</em>…’ warns us to take the better path. Lusts, selfish ambition, greed, all contribute to what’s wrong with the world. Jesus teaches us to pray against it. To choose another way. To live, not as single individuals, but as God’s family.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We can practice ‘choosing to live like God’s family’ even in the smallest things. Look into the different movements that ethically source food and clothes and, if you like what you see, consider changing your regular shopping so you can make a difference.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 12-14, Jn 11:1-16, Ps 4, Prov 30:1-4<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63453&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In today and tomorrow’s readings, we’ll be looking at what you see, and what you hear. Starting with the verse above, we have to recognise there’s always more than meets the eye. We have to trust God there’s more than what we see.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, what are you seeing? Is something ruling your life that you haven’t brought before God? Joseph’s father saw a blood–stained coat, and the deceitful mask of sorrow on his son’s faces, and believed Joseph was dead. He lived for years in grief because of the coat that he saw—but sometimes, there’s a difference between what we can see and the actual reality of the situation. Here’s another example: in 2 Kings 6:16–17, Elisha’s servant becomes terrified at the size of the army approaching. Elisha’s answer is not one of panic. Not one of despair. He said: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.</em>’ You can read what happens for yourself (well, go on then... we’ll still be here when you get back.) The servant’s fear was put well and truly into perspective.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Trust in God isn’t a crystal ball, or a set of blueprints. It’s more like a lifejacket. We don’t necessarily see the way forward. But we can ask for God’s perspective.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We’ve all been there; taken one look at the deadline / job requirements / doctor’s prognosis, then allowed these things to dictate our perspective. If you need to pray about your situation and get God’s perspective on it; make sure you get on with that right now.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The word of the Lord came to Elijah...saying... &quot;I will send rain on the earth.&quot;' 1 Kings 18:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>What we hear can be life–changing, whether for good or bad. What we hear changes the way we think and act. A snide comment can make us regret wearing our favourite outfit. A piece of gossip can make us prejudiced against someone we don’t really know. We (often believe and) act on what we’re told—and this includes all that negative self–talk, too.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, is <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>word4U2day</em> about to give you some vague obvious advice about listening out for God, and leave it there?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Well, not precisely. Answering why we need it is the best starting point for seeing all the ways He can speak to us.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Leaning in and keeping a spiritual ear out for God is the only way to get the most out of life. In fact, you really won’t be prepared for all life will throw at you without open communication with God. The prophet Elijah was an amazing guy. There’s a lot we can learn from him. Today’s verse comes after a long period of severe drought. The people were able to get ready to make the most of the long–awaited rainwater because Elijah heard from God and passed on the message—he heard God and changed lives.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Your relationship with God isn’t just a blessing to others. It’s meant to change you, the world and to spread the Kingdom of God. Getting close to God radically changes so many lives for the better. So spend time in your Bible today and get that ‘spark’ back in your relationship with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Take heart...l have overcome the world.' John 16:33 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Our last couple of days have been centred around the input into our lives: what we see and hear (forgotten already? Have a skim back through.) Now, what happens when we don’t keep watch over all of that? When there’s so much going on that we’ve forgotten to keep looking and listening out for God?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Well, try this for size: <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>fear</em>. And we don’t just mean being scared out of your wits about stuff. When we aren’t ‘fearing’ God (which means respecting and reverencing Him), we find ourselves giving people the final say in our lives. It might be a bully or a critic. In fact, Jesus knew that ultimately, if God calls you to something, you have to be careful that even those closest to us don’t hold us up from doing our ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Father’s business</em>’ (Luke 2:49).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s not always easy when the world around you seems to be fearful about what you are, too. Keeping your head screwed on even when it looks like a storm’s coming is a challenge to anyone. But Jesus says ‘…<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Take heart…l have overcome the world</em>.’ (John 16:33 NLT) It wouldn’t have taken much for the disciples to start panicking about doing ‘life’ without Jesus. They’d just been let in on knowing how much opposition they’d come up against, and on top of that, Jesus was about to leave them. But the fact that Jesus promised to be with them in Spirit was more than enough to reassure them. And it’s got to be the same for us, too.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ecc 1-4, Jn 11:28-37, Ps 50, Prov 30:7-10 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63496&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['O Lord...give me success today.' Genesis 24:12 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ever spent much time thinking about what God thinks about your work? Whether it’s education / part time job / full time career, it probably fills up a reasonable amount of your headspace. In Colossians, Paul gives us a clear principle to live by: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord</em>.’ (Colossians 3:23 NIV) Today we’ll be looking at what to do when ‘work’ is difficult/ you don’t really want to do it ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>as if for the Lord</em>’.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Minor character time. Ever heard of Eliezer? Back in Genesis, Abraham commissioned him with the job of finding Isaac (Abraham’s son) a wife. Bit of a strange–sounding task that—finding a spouse for the boss’ son. And not an easy one either; he had to start from scratch. This is where we learn a big lesson from Eliezer: just because it’s your job to do something doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to invite God right into the centre of it. The verse at the top is a quote: he prayed for success.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>A quick aside—praying for God to be with you is never going to be a bad idea. We just need to make sure success doesn’t become our god. If getting to the top (or staying there) is your reason for getting up every morning, you’ll need to dethrone that attitude quick smart.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Yet God will help you become more like Jesus everyday—and fulfil His purpose in you. Don’t have a clue what that looks like? Under pressure? Read the whole of Eliezer’s success story. (Genesis 24)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' Genesis 24:46 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, Eliezer has embarked on his mission to find a wife for Isaac. He’s ended up in a place called Nahor; somewhere he probably didn’t have much of a clue about. But, God was on his side. Remember his prayer (yesterday’s verse)? Verse 15 tells us that ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Before he had finished praying</em>’, Rebekah, a local girl, showed up. The future daughter–in–law to Abraham, household name in Israel, famous Bible character. Are you on the edge of your seat yet? What’s she going to do??</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ready? She offers him a drink of water… AND—get this—to water his camels, too.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Hmm. Maybe not the triumphant entrance you expected. Until you read between the lines (don’t worry, we’ll do it for you)—a full bucket of water is about 4 litres which weighs 4 kg. A thirsty camel can slurp through about 120 litres, and there were ten camels.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, Rebekah drew 1200 litres of water (weighing over a tonne!) for a stranger—a fairly decent pointer for Eliezer. This is a great example of someone working ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>as if for the Lord</em>’ (Colossians 3:23)—she was acting out of good will, not trying to please her boss / teacher. Aiming for our own success shouldn’t be our goal in life, but whether it’s this time round or in Heaven, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>You know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does</em>.’ (Ephesians 6:8 NIV)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Struggle with motivation for work? Nip down to your nearest well… ok, ok joke. But what excessive generosity can you offer to God through blessing someone today?</p>

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ever feel like you’re on the receiving end of a barrage of curveballs? Over and over: one day stress, the next disappointment. And just as you’re slowly getting back up to your feet, worry and anxiety come hurtling round the corner to smack you down. We’ve all been in a ‘when–will–this–end?’ situation, and they’re never easy.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Check out the context for today’s verse: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Then Jews…came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead</em>.’ (Acts 14:19 NKJ) Paul somehow got back up. And more impressively, he went straight on ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>into the city</em>’ to carry on his mission.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>…What? He didn’t call the whole thing off after being stoned? And this was by no means the only time he was knocked down. Whatever Paul had, we definitely need it:</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(1) He had a relationship with God. He was one focussed Jewish boy. Looking up to God is the way to keep hope in the future, so as not to throw the sweaty, bloodied towel in. Only this kind of gritty optimism could lead him to write in 2 Corinthians 4:8—‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>We are hard–pressed on every side, yet not crushed…struck down, but not destroyed</em>.’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(2) He had a relationship with Godly people—Paul only got up after his ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>disciples gathered around him</em>.’ (Acts 14:20 NKJ) He wasn’t alone. He needed all the encouragement and support he could get—and in tough times, so do we.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Demas has forsaken me...' 2 Timothy 4:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Paul writes one of the saddest verses in Scripture: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world</em>.’ Following Jesus is a bit of a rollercoaster. A rattling car of enormous peaks, terrifying lows, pulsating twists and turns, and thrilling loop–the–loops. Sometimes we’re speeding along, enjoying the ride; other times we’re hanging on with bare white knuckles. Whatever we’re feeling, though, we’d be super–crazy to unbuckle during the ride. And yet some Christians do. Like Demas.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Perhaps he was tired of feeling alienated? Perhaps his doubts overcame him and he felt he couldn’t talk it over with others? Maybe a fellow believer hurt him? Maybe some stuff was too hard to believe now? Jesus seems to have that effect on some. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying; who can understand it?”… From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more</em>.’ (John 6:60–66 NKJ) Even today, bits of Jesus’ teaching are easier to swallow than others. Heaven is a wonderful thought but Hell... not so much. We love to hear that Jesus has a purpose for us. Loving God and loving others—nice one, Jesus. We’re really thankful Jesus sacrificed Himself and died for us. But what about making a sacrifice ourselves? What about the things that are even harder than love? And let’s face it, the ‘loving people’ thing isn’t always easy, anyway! But it’s a non–negotiable part of being a friend of Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Demas...loved this...world.' 2 Timothy 4:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Again we ask, ‘What happened to Demas?’ Maybe his faith involved too many scrapes. When Paul came to town, some came to faith while others came with stones. Beatings, imprisonment, arguments probably featured in a big way on Paul’s morning prayer–list. Maybe Demas signed up thinking all life’s problems would vanish by following Jesus. Church conferences today, especially for young people, can sometimes have this flavour: ‘Hands up who wants life to be smooth and effortless? Great. Hands up those who want to follow Jesus?’ (Not a direct quote, but you get what we mean?)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Think of the bits we leave out when we talk about our faith. How often do you hear, ‘Follow Jesus. Be misunderstood by people. Be the butt of jokes. Take the heat for controversial issues. Say “no” to fun stuff. Right, who wants to become a Christian?’ Ok, maybe this is not the way to win people over. But perhaps there is room in our evangelism for a fuller picture to be painted. Jesus certainly didn’t hide the tough stuff: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you</em>.’ (John 15:18–19 NKJ) If we want more Paul–people and less Demas–dudes, we need to balance what Jesus Himself taught—taking the rough with the smooth.</p>

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>At risk of failing exams. At risk of getting fired. At risk of messing up your future and being stuck in the same dead end, mindless, spirit–sucking job forever. At risk of bullying. At risk of never meeting that special someone and end up dying alone. At risk of identity theft. At risk of software crashing. At risk of friends betraying you.

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Living in 2014 is a risky business. Best roll yourself into a blanket of bubble wrap, cross your fingers and hope you get through this year risk–free, right? Flip!

Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord and He will give you your heart’s desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord.

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.' 1 Corinthians 11:24 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Whatever your church calls the distribution of bread ‘n’ wine, it is an amazing piece of what makes up following Jesus. Not only did Jesus say to do it in ‘remembrance’ of Him, but we’re somehow also meeting Jesus in that act of eating ‘bread’ (or wafers) and drinking ‘wine’ (or juice). We’re suddenly face to face with Jesus. In fact, when He started this bread and wine meal off with His disciples, He was echoing an ancient ‘covenant’ ritual, where two people exchanged everything they had, including their names. They even mingled blood, before sharing bread &amp; wine together. When they did this, it was considered that the two of them were as one person. Deep stuff.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Flash forward to today: that bread and wine you take? That’s a moment to remember what Jesus has done for you, to remember who He is (not was), to remember that He came after you on a rescue mission of love whilst you were still far off. But it’s more than that too. It’s your half of the covenant ritual. In taking bread &amp; wine (and asking the Holy Spirit to meet you in it), you’re becoming one with Jesus. Yep. The two of you are considered as one person.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>You exchange what you have for what He has. Your mess actually becomes His. His righteousness actually becomes yours. Communion is, quite simply, amazing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I consider Your Heavens, the work of Your fingers...' Psalm 8:3 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Take a sec to think about how big the place you live in is. Then, consider the whole bunch of communities/suburbs/towns/cities that make up your electorate. And how many electorates there are in your country. And how many countries on the face of the earth? ‘Kay, now zoom out. Our earth is floating amongst a whole lot of stars, and other planets. And that’s just the Milky Way, one of many galaxies. Bottom line: each one of us is a very small part of a very large universe.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Now, we aren’t trying to send you into some sort of existential crisis. In fact, it’s the opposite. Think of all of that as context to this:</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God. Knows. You.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Yes, we might feel absolutely tiny. We are in the context of this staggeringly huge universe, but God still sees us. And He loves what He sees. Romans 1:20 suggests that one of the reasons that God made the universe so, well, drop–dead stunning is for us. It says <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>‘…since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made…</em>’ Everything that God has made, from the complexities of the human body, to the massive expanse of space, is one of the ways He shows Himself to us. In Psalm 8, David talks about how he can see God’s glory in the world around him. Go read it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The magicians said to Pharaoh, &quot;This is the finger of God.&quot;' Exodus 8:19 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The magicians of Egypt were able to duplicate some of the signs Moses gave Pharaoh from God with visual trickery and illusion. Pharaoh was probably entertained by Moses but not impressed. And so Moses would return to his court again and again, each sign greater than the previous. But before long, the signs couldn’t be reproduced by Pharaoh’s magic circle any more. By the time of the plague of gnats and mozzies, they were scratching their heads (as well as just about everywhere else.) ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The finger of God!</em>’ they cried out in fear. But it didn’t matter to Pharaoh. He insisted on saying ‘no’ to God. ‘No’ to a God who was trying to help him not reap the consequences of the child–killing spree his ancestors had undertaken eighty years previously.<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>   </span>The last plague was imminent but still Pharaoh said ‘no’. Every firstborn boy died as a result of his hard heart.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The Passover story teaches us that God’s finger will not force us to obey but He will claim back what is rightfully His. He will allow the consequences of the past to catch up with us. Pharaoh was given many chances. He didn’t take them. It’s not a formula, but we can take on a lesson for us today: don’t ignore the will of God. The Psalmist wrote, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary</em>.’ (Psalm 77:13 NKJ) Then he added, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Your way was in the sea... in the great waters</em>…’ (Psalm 77:19 NKJ) The sanctuary—the safe place where we learn the easy way—or the storm—the rough place where we learn the hard way: what’s your choice today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He gave him the two stone tablets...written by the finger of God.' Exodus 31:18 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Why not on paper? Or parchment? Or inscribed onto wood? Perhaps there was something symbolic about the Ten Commandments being written on stone. Stone is hard and uncompromising. Not easily shattered. Here were rules not to be broken or messed with.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>As God’s finger etched words of life into the cold stone, a moral code to build up a society was being written. Even today our laws agree with these principles: don’t murder, don’t steal stuff, don’t lie. Most people today couldn’t tell you all Ten Commandments and yet their conscience would still agree with what Moses brought down from Sinai all those years ago. It’s as if the finger of God has written His laws and principles onto the hearts of men and women. Our conscience bears the trace of God’s values. When we choose to ignore our conscience, sooner or later there will be consequences. A diver can break through the surface of a lake with ease during summer. And yet in the winter freeze it is possible to ride a truck across stony frozen water. It’s like that with our conscience. When our hearts are soft to God, we obey. When we repeatedly disobey, our hearts become frozen hard. It’s best to practise obedience, otherwise God may need to turn up the heat to thaw out our hearts.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger...' John 8:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>What was Jesus writing in the ground that day? A wife had been caught in the bed linen of a lover. She was dragged by the hair into the street by religious leaders. What should they do with her? Throw sharp rocks at her until she passed into unconsciousness—that was the usual routine.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But then somebody thought of Jesus: <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>What would that upside–down preacher make of this? Let’s bring her to Him.</em> They couldn’t get their list of accusations out quick enough. They probably sounded like they were foaming at the mouth. But Jesus didn’t even bother to look them in the eye. He stooped low, writing with His finger in the dust.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Why?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s not made clear in the Bible exactly what He wrote. Perhaps He wrote ‘forgiveness’ or ‘grace’. Maybe He recalled a verse from one of the prophets. Some people think He wrote down the sins of the accusers. (A subtle dig at their hypocrisy! After all, it takes two to commit adultery and the lover hadn’t been publicly shamed, had he?)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The passage doesn’t tell us. It only tells us that Jesus didn’t join in the condemnation. He reminded the crowd that they weren’t saints themselves. Bit by bit the crowd dispersed. The woman looked around and there was nobody left to accuse her. Neither did Jesus. Instead He offered the woman a new start. The same goes today. Cheating, lying, backstabbing—whatever mess you find yourself in, Jesus lifts you up from the dust to give you a new start.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'We count them blessed who endure...' James 5:11 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Today, the whole idea of ‘endurance’ is a bit Bear Grylls. But we’re pretty sure that, when James wrote ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>we count them blessed who endure</em>,’ he probably wasn’t saying that making an igloo out of your own frozen sweat gets you more blessings from God. In fact, to Him, endurance is much more of an everyday thing. Let’s face it, it’s more than likely you’ll face something difficult at least once a day. Your ability to endure has everything to do with that. Whether they’re big or small problems, endurance is in how we deal with those difficulties. If you ever studied French, you might remember that ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>dur</em>’ is used to describe something that’s rock–hard, something that stands firm. So, en–<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>dur</em>–ance then… we reckon we could call that ‘standing firm in the face of difficulties’. And that’s a pretty Biblical model for living life.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul writes: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Be alert, stand firm in the faith, be brave, be strong</em>.’ (1 Corinthians 16:13 GNT) That is how we do what James is talking about. It’s all too easy to start doubting God and His plans when things are difficult. It’s all too easy to start finding not–quite–so–Godly ways to make ourselves feel better, but that’s not endurance. The only really really good way to pull through is to ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>stand firm in the faith</em>’.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will be proved right in what You say.' Romans 3:4 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Whatever God says is absolutely true. And when He puts together a plan, He sees it through. Romans 3:4 quotes one of David’s psalms (Psalm 51:4, to be exact), where he’s crying out to God because he knows he’s messed up—big time. (Check out 2 Samuel 11 and 12 for the whole story. That’s a lot of Bible in this first paragraph, but it’s all the same story).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>After being told what the consequences of his sin are going to be, David tells God, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>You will be proved right in what You say</em>.’ He knew that God always delivers on whatever He says. And he was right; all that the prophet explained to David came to pass. Now, because of the way that David had acted, the consequences turned out a lot less than great. Sometimes, we act in ways that leave us picking up the pieces of what we’ve done. But here’s the thing: when David called on God, he wasn’t let down. God got him through.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Now, there is a flip side. And a pretty great one at that. Imagine how God, the God who loves you immensely, definitely does rejoice in seeing through the good things that He promises. When He lays out His plans for your life, the minute that you say ‘yes’ to Him and to those plans, He starts to make them happen. And He absolutely loves doing so. Whatever He has said about you, pursue it. Because what God says, goes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am watching to see that My Word is fulfilled.' Jeremiah 1:12 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God told Jeremiah that He was going to use him as a prophet. Jeremiah wasn’t convinced he was cut out for the role and was pretty quick to tell God he wasn’t up for it. He didn’t think he had the skills. But God knew what He was doing (He tends to…) He gave Jeremiah the supernatural ability to do exactly what He had planned for him. And Jeremiah did it (not without difficulties along the way, but he went and he did it).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And that’s the power of God’s words. When He speaks them over us, He’s going to make sure that we’re ready for whatever–it–is He’s called us to do. And that’s why it generally works pretty well when we live in the plans that God has for us. That’s why it’s so good to spend so much time going: ‘Uhhhh, Lord… what do I do?’ He knows what you’re made for. He’s the one who made you for it in the first place. His plans for you fit nobody but you. If the plan isn’t His, there’s not too much chance that you’re going to be fully equipped for it.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Bottom line... If you’re wondering what to do next, try as a starter: ‘Help? Jesus, please!’<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>Then go for what you think is right, and keep checking it. We may not get to see His original blueprints, so we wouldn’t suggest checking over your shoulder anxiously for God’s neon sign every day of your life. However, if you’re running your plans past the Planner, He’ll steer you right.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 30:25-31:55, Jn 15:18-27, Ps 65, Prov 31:25-27 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63512&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...In all things at all times, having all that you need...' 2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, the past two days have been a bit inwardly focussed, all about what God’s saying over your life. That’s not a bad thing, at all. But what about when we fold that out? What are we, as Christians, supposed to do about God’s plans for other people?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Well, in true 2 Corinthians 9 spirit, we think it’s a really good idea to get alongside anyone who is working towards fulfilling something that God’s said about them. If we’re generous with our prayers, our encouragement, and whatever else we can be generous with, the world around us will start to look a lot more like God wants it to. Paul goes on to say that we ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 9:11 NIV) You will definitely have something that can help someone else—God made us that way. We weren’t given our gifts, skills, or money for ourselves, but to serve others. If we keep these things for us, we’re wasting their potential to show off God in our lives. Be faithful in the small things, so God will trust you with the larger ones.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise...' Romans 4:20 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, if we’re completely clear on what God’s saying to us, raring to follow it, and have a bunch of people supporting us in it, it’s going to be like a walk in the park. Right?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Well… ummmm… maybe not always. The truth is, sometimes a part of the plan is difficulty. See, God can make anything happen, whichever way He wants to. Your Bible is full of examples. But because of the not–all–powerful human perspective that we have, some stuff looks downright impossible. In reality, we can be following God’s plans as well as is humanly possible, but it may still feel like nothing’s happening.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Abraham must have certainly felt like God had promised Him something impossible, at times. He was mooching up towards 100 years of age and still the son God had promised hadn’t been born. Kind of laughable to think it would happen at that point. But Abraham never (entirely) let those feelings come between him and God’s plan. For us, that’s often easier said than done. But it’s all about turning back to God every time His plan seems uncertain. If that happens, re–visit His original promise and ask Him to keep your faith clear. Isaiah 55:11 NLT is where God says, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>It is the same with My Word. I send it out, and it always produces fruit. It will accomplish all I want it to, and it will prosper everywhere I send it</em>.’ Keep hold of that. Whatever God has promised you will happen. No matter how unlikely it looks. It’s coming.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power.' Rev 4:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Jesus. The Name above all names. It’s a phrase you might have heard often enough, but what’s it really mean?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Well, there is power in a name. And the name of Jesus of Nazareth, son of God, Saviour of the world is the name that has the power to save us.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Paul writes that ‘…<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>there is… one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ</em>.’ (1 Timothy 2:5 NKJ) Jesus is the only One who is able to bridge the gap between us and God. He chose to die the brutal death that WE deserve, which broke open the gates to allow us to live in His power. When we say ‘in Jesus’ name’, we’re not just saying a nice little Christian phrase to show we’re done praying. We’re saying that we’re taking hold of the Name that carries the power of the most precious Man, and His most precious action (the death that beat Death for good).</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ok, so it might sound like the nineteenth century if we tell you to ‘meditate upon the name of Jesus.’ But… ummm… we’re still going to. Do it. Try to focus your mind and your heart on Jesus (the very real, living, breathing, death–beating person Jesus). Spend a while quietly in prayer, thinking about the power of His name.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope...' Hebrews 10:23 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The history of humanity’s relationship with God revolves around hope. Before Jesus came to earth, God’s people lived in hope of His arrival—as promised. When He went back to Heaven, His followers waited in hope of the arrival of the Holy Spirit—as promised. Now, we live in the hope of Jesus coming back—as promised.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And, because we have God, hoping is not a matter of crossing our fingers and chancing it. True hope is confidence. God has always had a big plan for humanity; He’s known what to do right from the beginning (Revelation 13:8 shows that Jesus was ready to save us for, well, forever). That’s right. God’s got it sorted. Even when things look like they’re going horribly, horribly wrong, there is hope. There is a plan. That doesn’t mean that it’s not ok to feel a bit ragged and tossed–around sometimes. But it does mean we can’t ever lose sight of our hope in God. That’s what anchors our soul, and simultaneously allows it to have the freedom to rest in God it longs for. There’s a forgotten word that we here at W4U HQ think should be brought back into fashion. It’s ‘apricity’: <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>warmth of the sun in cold times</em>. Godly apricity is what our hope in Jesus does for our souls in the hard times of our lives. Think of it like warmth of the Son in cold times.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.' Luke 19:40 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>‘Worship was rocking this morning!’ Hrmm. Ever cringed when someone’s said that? The verse above puts it in a different light. Rocks worshipping. And you might also have also sung about trees clapping their hands, or mountains bowing down. What does it all mean?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>All of creation is designed to show how worthy God is of praise. Because it demonstrates how much worth God deserves; it ‘worships’ (shows ‘worth’–ship of) Him. Just by existing—and doing what it’s supposed to do as a rock or a tree or a whatever.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And as God’s followers, we should follow suit. Just by existing as people of God, we worship God. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Let my prayer be set before You as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice</em>.’ (Psalm 141:2 NKJ) It’s pretty much what you were made for: worshipping God is core to being part of God’s creation.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>One more story. At one point in history, the Philistines had taken the Ark of the Covenant from God’s people. The Ark symbolised the presence of God for His people back then. When they lost that, they lost everything. Without inviting God’s presence to be with you and fill you up, worship becomes dry. And probably half–hearted. Now, we don’t have time for the full story. But what happened when they got the Ark of the Covenant back? ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets</em>.’ (1 Chronicles 13:8 NIV) So, ask God to gift you with His presence next time you’re about to start singing at church (or whenever you do worship).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His praise will always be on my lips.' Psalm 34:1 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Keith Hudson is a preacher who made waves on the internet, speaking about a Katy Perry concert. He said ‘…there were twenty thousand people... they were going at it. It almost looked like a church… I stood there and wept and kept on weeping and weeping… they’re loving and worshipping the wrong thing.’ It’s a fairly obvious thing to say until you learn that Keith Hudson is Katy Perry’s dad.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Yeah, the rant sounds a little old–fashioned. But here’s something we can take away: it’s sad we can get so excited about things that have no eternal value. As a Christian we have to be wise with what we watch and listen to. ‘...<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God</em>.’ (Colossians 1:10 NIV) The thrills and lights of stadium tours and promo videos can cut in on our search for the electrifying presence of God—something we’re designed for, something we’re supposed to be satisfied by. They may give us an easy high—but it’s a second best one.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God lived happy as a community of Father, Son and Spirit long before anyone strummed ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Bless the Lord oh my soul</em>.’ And yet He is pleased when we sing and praise Him and, on top of that, it cheers us up. We need to worship far more than God needs to hear it. Have a go at adding some more worship songs to your music mix this week and work at keeping His praise always on your lips.</p><br /><br />  SoulFood: Gen 42-43, Jn 18:19-40, Ps 148:1-6, Ecc 5:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63518&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Jesus Christ.' Philippians 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>We’re regularly told that status matters—that the best thing you can be in this world is a celebrity. The fame. The wealth. The fans. The award ceremonies celebrating your existence.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>What is it that makes us hanker after respect and power? Fame is like the shiny fruit hanging in Eden. We’d all love a bite but we’re half–sure we’ve been warned against it.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ok, well what about spending a day walking like Mother Teresa? She set up schools for street children, held the dying in her arms, and cared for the disabled. Francis of Assisi traded his vast family wealth in order to live with outcasts and lepers and the homeless. This is the kind of fame that delights Heaven. This is the fame that Jesus is known for. Paul writes: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>You must have the same attitude that… Jesus had. Though He was God, He did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. Instead, He gave up His divine privileges… took the… position of a slave… humbled Himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on the cross. Therefore, God elevated Him to the place of highest honour and gave Him the name above all other names</em>.’ (Philippians 2:5–9 NLT)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Being a celebrity means we expect others to serve us; being a Christ follower means we are called to serve others. Start to practise serving others this week. It’s as easy as popping on the kettle for gran or washing the car for a neighbour. Try it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I desire to do Your will, my God.' Psalm 40:8 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Imagine if Jesus came in the twenty–first century and not the first: He could have been a celebrity chef with the way He turned a couple of loaves and fish into a feast. Or got a TV series with the way He could heal the sick and raise the dead. But, despite having all of time to choose from, He came 2000 years ago. He’s obviously more interested in people than in making a name for Himself.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Jesus doesn’t just think it is a good idea to serve, He expects it: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>When you have done all things which you are commanded, say, “We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.”</em>’ (Luke 17:10 NKJ) ‘Our duty’—key words. It isn’t always easy to decide every day to keep in God’s will. But as we stop dragging our feet to follow God, the obedience will pay off. Being ready to say ‘yes’ to that nudge He’ll gives us when it’s time to avoid that temptation/ speak to that person/ read the Bible/ whatever He wants, it gets easier. Jesus showed us what this looks like: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served. But to serve and give His life as a ransom for many</em>.’ (Mark 10:45 NIV)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, a challenge. There’s real joy in serving God, but you’ll need to put the willpower in. Up for it?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In your prayer time, have a look at your plan for today, and jot down the opportunities to serve someone in it. Ask Jesus to open some up, and step up to them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I do not seek My own will, but the will of the Father.' John 5:30 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Can God count on you? Can other people? Are you always reliable, kinda reliable (when it suits you) or mostly unreliable? The Bible describes Jesus like this: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Having loved His own…He loved them unto the end.</em>’ (John 13:1 KJV) Tick one for other people being able to count on Him. And when it came to God, He could say, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me</em>.’ (John 5:30 NKJV) Tick two for God being able to count on Him.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>When you make a commitment, do you keep it? Do you quit on a whim, or break your word because you get a better offer? Do you let people down? ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called him in a vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered</em>.’ (Acts 9:10 NIV) God knew where to find Ananias. Does He know where to find you? And when He calls you, are you ready to stand up and be counted? Or is it: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>I hear you, God, but what You’re asking is inconvenient right now. Would You mind asking again when my circumstances are better?</em>’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Your faithfulness shouldn’t depend on convenience or affordability. It should depend only on your commitment to Christ. Remember the US Marine Corps motto, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Semper Fidelis</em>’, the Latin for ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Always Faithful</em>’. It’s a good motto for a disciple of Christ too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A hot-tempered person commits all kinds of sin.' Proverbs 29:22 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In Genesis 4:3–7, we read that Cain was jealous that his brother’s gift was accepted and his wasn’t. He had let resentment build up. He hadn’t found a way of dealing with his forceful emotions, and his feelings had swayed his thinking. When he murdered his brother, a timeless truth rang out, <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>‘…A hot–tempered person commits all kinds of sin.</em>’ (Proverbs 29:22 NLT)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Anger can be Godly when used to move us to righteous action. We are right to feel angry about human trafficking, for instance. When we see injustice, it can be a Godly reaction to want to say something and make a difference. But often anger is destructive leading to terrible consequences. Jesus said that when you let anger build up against someone in your heart, you’re already making a big mistake (Matthew 5:21–22). Anger can be a seriously damaging thing. Controlling it and asking God to keep it in check is a huge deal.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>So, there’s a right way and a wrong way to be ‘angry’. One of the most helpful passages is: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold</em>.’ (Ephesians 4:26–27 NIV) When you can feel something stirring up within you, take a deep breath first and ask—is this going to create more pain, rather than lead to healing?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Analyse your own anger: is it righteous or destructive? How are you going to deal with it? Begin by talking to God about it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.' 1 Samuel 18:9 NAS<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>When you look through the lens of misguided anger, what you choose to focus on tends to end up being all you actually see. Being blind to reality is dangerous, because it causes you to go to extremes. At one point David was a young shepherd, who played the harp. He played for Saul (the fourth, the fifth; the minor fall, the major lift...), and kept him calm. Yet when it was clear that God had chosen David to take lead the nation, starting with the defeat of a giant named Goliath, Saul got bitter.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The people sang, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands</em>.’ (1 Samuel 18:7 NIV) He saw David as a threat to his throne. <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Don’t they realise this boy was nothing until I took him in</em>, Saul thought. <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Who was it that saw him promoted to the highest ranks? Me! What next—my throne? Is that what he wants? To be king?</em> And from that day on Saul kept a jealous eye on David; an angry fire burned in his veins.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>If you read the story of this pair’s relationship, one thing becomes clear—David is one of the best friends that Saul could ever have had. Letting anger manipulate you, even in subtle ways, is always dangerous. Don’t let it happen. Think about it: what are the best ways to avoid envy taking over?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.' James 1:19 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Let’s get to the root of this anger biz:</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s pretty clear that charging angrily into a situation doesn’t get us anywhere. And God’s not keen on us doing that either. The thing is, there are much, much better (and God–approved) ways to deal with those smaaaaaaaash moments. We know, in some situations it’s impossible to not feel a flash of rage—we can’t exactly choose what to feel. BUT, what is our choice, is what we do with that feeling. Here’s our options:</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Keep it in</em>. Don’t say anything while we let that anger stay with us for the rest of the day/ week/ century.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Act in the heat of the moment and mood</em>. Let the objects of our anger know exactly what we think of them.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>(3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Have a conversation</em>. Calmly. Try to understand whatever–it–is–that–made–your–blood–boil, and go from there.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Now, only one of those options seems to make sense to us. Care to take a guess? Yup. We’d recommend facing the thing that bugs you, with as much grace and God–given understanding as you can pray for. Proverbs 15:1 NIV says, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger</em>.’ Gentleness may not seem like the easiest, or most impressive, response to an enraging situation. But it’s the right one. Next time you feel like giving someone a piece of your mind, stop. Take seven breaths. Ask the person: ‘To help me understand, what did you mean by…’ and use their answer as the start of a dialogue.</p>

Then God gave him a weather update: everyone should get ready for storm season. We’ve got to be ready for God’s updates too—listening in so we’ll be ready for what life throws at us.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God is more than willing to tell you when to save and when to spend, when to buy and when to sell, when to talk and when to be silent. ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it.”</em>’ (Isaiah 30:21 NKJV) But, for many of us, Satan’s so busy whispering in our ears, the voice of God is drowned out. Satan’s got some special lines he’s perfected: ‘You’re a loser. You’re ugly. You’re rubbish. Nobody loves you.’ Like you’d ever hear that from God! Not a chance. He’s on your side and only waits your invitation to fight for you. Knowing He would soon be crucified, Jesus prayed, ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>“Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, ‘I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.” Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered…</em>’ (John 12:28-29 NKJ) Isn’t it amazing? Some can hear the voice of God, while others hear only noise. What are you hearing? Who are you listening to? The voice of God or the devil’s noise?<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>Make a choice to tune out Satan and tune into God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It will produce thorns... for you.' Genesis 3:18 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>In Genesis 3, Adam and Eve made a choice, and because of that choice came consequences.<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>After that, everything changes. Like everything. The whole world. The link between God and humans was no longer the same. People got locked into their own self–and–others–destructive choices. Existence became… well, thorny. Go back to Genesis 3 and check out verse 18. There. Those thorns mentioned represent all of the consequences of humanity’s choices—sin, separation and death.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Now, read Matthew 27:31 about the crown of thorns placed on Jesus’ head by the Roman soldiers: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head…</em>’ Just before He gave His life to free us all, Jesus took those thorns—sin, separation and death—upon Himself, and wore them literally as a crown. He took all of the consequences meant for us, and experienced the death that goes with them. And, by doing that, He became our bridge back to God. By wearing those thorns, He beat them. Jesus beat sin; He beat separation; He beat death. Because of Him, we can choose to live a life full of God and grace. Then, because of Him, we can spend the rest of forever with that same God.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Take a few minutes to really think over what Jesus did. It’s the absolute centre of the Christian faith. Then, when you’ve done that, write a ‘thank you’ note to Jesus. Stick it up somewhere prominent to remind you regularly of what He did in dying for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It will produce thorns... for you.' Genesis 3:18 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Yesterday, we thought about how Heaven’s answer to a thorny existence is a thorn–crowned Saviour. Now, there’s another part to that story. There is, shall we say, another set of thorns. After Jesus wore that crown and beat the consequences of sin, God decided to use thorns for His (and our) good. Being a Christian doesn’t mean that we get to entirely avoid all difficult stuff. It means we know Who we turn to when the difficult stuff happens.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Look at 2 Corinthians 12:7–10. Paul mentions ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>a thorn in the flesh</em>’—something that really made life hard for him. Something that was trying to get in the way of his relationship with God. We all have those thorns. And God allows them for one reason: that we use them as inspiration to look to Him. We can’t beat thorns in our own strength. The only thing to do is to turn to God and ask Him for help. He may not remove them straight away, but He’ll certainly strengthen your relationship with Him while you’re dealing with them. And look back at yesterday’s reading—Jesus who bled from the thorn of death in our place. The ‘thorns’ of this life don’t last for eternity; they help prepare you for it. As long as you’re <span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span>truly striving for the life of love that God asks for, He’ll make ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>all things work together for good</em>.’ (Romans 8:28 NKJ) So, chat to some wiser/older Christians you really trust about your own ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>thorn in the flesh</em>’. Get them to pray with you, asking for God’s strength in dealing with your personal thorns.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 8-10, Lk 1:39-56, Ps 57, Ecc 7:19-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63528&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Remember that kid in your nursery class, you know, the one with cool light–up trainers that made your regular off–white sneakers feel really rubbish? No?</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Just like that, chances are, in a few years you won’t remember measuring yourself against someone else’s standards. So why bother now? You might want what those around you seem to have, but honestly, you’ll have forgotten about it not too far down the track.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>And, as for now, God gives you exactly what you need. Let’s say that again. God gives you exactly what you need. So, the guy next to you has something that looks really flashy right now (especially when they stamp their feet?) That’s a part of their plan. God’s taking care of your plan, and He’s asking you to work with Him to be all that you are made to be. And, believe it or not, He’ll give you the right tools to get there (He’s amazing like that!) Whatever you don’t have is as much a part of the plan as what you do have. And yes, that can be horribly, horribly disappointing sometimes. Especially when everyone else seems to have everything sorted. But, not getting those grades/that job/the girl may have been the first step towards a bigger and better plan.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Pray for God’s view of your situation, and ask for His help in seeing it His way. Cross out (with a pen, or, if you’re reading this on a screen, with your fingers…) the first NO COMPARE in the title when you’ve prayed it through. Repeat for the other two.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.' James 4:17 ESV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Procrastination—we all do it, right? Like when you should be studying but instead you’re scrolling through Facebook, watching cute cat videos or doing anything BUT what you should be doing...</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Following God can sometimes, very unfortunately, follow that routine. Have a think, are there certain aspects of the Christian life too difficult to start attempting? Or maybe something God’s been prompting you to do that just feels too big? You already know that the answer isn’t in ignoring those things. We don’t really need to tell you that. But we will anyway. The answer really isn’t in ignoring what needs to be done and doing something else instead. Procrastination gets you nowhere.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>James 4:13–17 talks about how we can’t really know about the future (aside from what God has already revealed to us in His Word). Then, it says: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin</em>.’ Essentially, James is saying ‘get your act into gear and do what you know is right.’ Is there something that God wants to you to do, that you’ve been putting off or ignoring? Is there a part of the Christian life that you’ve never really wanted to adopt, even though you know you should? Well then, here’s some practical advice for today: Do it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Listen to advice...and...you will be wise...' Proverbs 19:20 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Paul took a young guy named Timothy under his wing. They had such a strong mentor/mentee relationship Paul called him his ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>true son in the faith</em>.’ (1 Timothy 1:2 GNT) The pair ended up travelling around, helping to grow, and look after, churches. They even ended up in prison for their Godly work together on more than one occasion. Paul helped Timothy become the person that God wanted him to be, and he could only do that because Timothy knew how to take advice seriously.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It’s so, so important to be able to learn from others. No matter how much you know, you still have something to learn. André Agassi was a world-class tennis player whose coach wasn’t nearly as good as him on the court. But when asked, André stated, ‘Tennis requires subtle adjustments crucial to winning and my coach... is the best... The older I get, the more valuable he becomes.’ Even consistent winners need help to improve!</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Chances are, there’s someone in your church who could teach you a lot—someone to go back to with questions and problems and ideas and prayer requests and, well, everything.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>It can sometimes feel a bit weird talking about faith with someone outside of our group of mates. Especially when the person seems to be one of those have–it–all–together people. But that’s exactly the sort of person who might just make a great mentor. It’s worth being brave. Go on. Ask for advice.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will make you fishers of men.' Matthew 4:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>There were days Simon dreamt of packing it in. Catching fish wasn’t easy work. Days could be too hot for fishing; nights could be too cold. Some mornings it lashed down and he didn’t feel much like getting into a boat. Other days the waters were just freezing. And now, here was Jesus promising a lifetime of ‘fishing’ for men.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Perhaps Simon hoped it would be easier. Yet he’d soon realise there would be easy and tough days with people, too. There would be long sermons and great healing meetings, and still nobody would bite. There would be days when trouble just lashed down. Sometimes he just wouldn’t feel like fishing for men.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>But if the fishing business had taught him anything, it was to get out to sea. To be a do–er. The only way to scoop up a successful catch was to get the wind in his hair, the sea–breeze in his lungs and get on with the backbreaking work of hauling up nets. Following Jesus would be pretty similar. Spending most of his life sitting down, not reaching anyone, wasn’t for him.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>When it comes to walking out our faith, it’s sometimes best just get out there fishing in your school/college/workplace. Church is meant to help us in this, but not hide us from it. Sometimes, if we aren’t serving others, we start serving ourselves. If we aren’t helping the hurting, we can end up hurting the helping.</p>

<title><![CDATA[NATIVITY WINDOW--JOSEPH]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[nativity-window-joseph]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Joseph, her fiancé, was a good man...' Matthew 1:19 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Mary rightly gets a lot of attention over Christmas. Fair enough. She’s a hero of the faith. But Joseph’s part in the Christmas story is often seen as a bit of a cameo appearance. After all, he isn’t the real father, right? But there’s a reason that God sent an angel to him, too.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>The culture at the time called for Joseph to divorce Mary as soon as he found out she was pregnant. In fact, it is likely that some members of his community would have been out for her blood—a normal punishment for suspected adultery was stoning. But Joseph was faithful to God against culture pressure. He had the courage to stand up against these voices.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Middle East expert Kenneth Bailey points out: ‘In the Middle East, men usually represent their families in any official or legal matters. Why did Joseph take Mary with him to Bethlehem for the registration? The easiest explanation is that he was unsure what might happen to her if he left her in Nazareth without his presence to protect her.’</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Joseph wasn’t the hero of the Christmas story. But without his courage and support there may have been no story to tell. Take a moment to think about the ‘minor characters’ in your life—the ones you rarely thank for their quiet, faithful (maybe even courageous) contribution to who you are today. Take the opportunity of writing to them this Christmas to show your gratitude.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A tree is known by its fruit.' Matthew 12:33 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>There’s an old saying, ‘If you were accused of being a Christian, would anyone find enough evidence to convict you?’ Hmm. What evidence would they find? Maybe they’d find your Spotify playlist full of the best of <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Hillsong</em>. A ‘WWJD’ bracelet tucked away in your drawer. Maybe an old Easterfest programme knocking about.</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>Ok for a start, but what about the deeper stuff? Would they find you praying when the door is locked? Or volunteering down the old folks’ home (or Foodbank) without being asked? Or slipping an extra tenner in the collection plate when nobody is looking? Would they find you on Bible Gateway more often than Facebook? Meditating more than gaming? Encouraging as opposed to backbiting? Could they trust you, respect you, admire your honesty? Would you be found moping or inspired? Lustful or loving? Jesus didn’t say, ‘A Christian is known by the size of his fish bumper–sticker.’ No, He said, ‘…<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>a tree is recognised by its fruit</em>.’ (Matthew 12:33 NIV) ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>You…must be an example…by doing good works of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching.</em>’ (Titus 2:7 NLT)</p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>God’s done everything needed to open up your relationship with Him. You can’t ‘work‘ it into perfection. But—<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>relationship</em>—yeah? Now He’s made it available, have all of the areas of your life got involved in that relationship? How do you fare with these challenges? Think your relationship needs more commitment? Pray. Prayer is always the fuel for Godly character. Ask God for more good evidence in your life.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...be clear minded and self-controlled...' 1 Peter 4:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>As we said yesterday, becoming an adult can be a tricky process. But no matter how bewildering it is, it does end. You'll grow to feel more comfortable in your maturity, and once the transitioning is over you'll move out of that stuck place into having a stable identity as an adult. Until then, though, it could make things a whole lot clearer if you find someone who can give you pointers for the problematic things. Yep, that may mean taking advice from your mum, dad or someone else like that. Believe it or not, you can never be too old for advice. The Bible says '...you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders...' (1 Peter 5:5-7 NKJ) You know why it says that? Because they already know (some of) the answers. They won't stress about the questions. Standing in the middle of it, your own life can become a bit of a blur. Out of focus, like a picture up too close. Chatting to someone can pull it back into perspective, enabling you to '...be clear minded...' like God intends. From a zoomed out view, you can make clear-headed decisions. So go on. Stick your hands above your head and ask for help. Forget becoming 'cool' by lowering your standards; that's a no-win alternative. Nothing is as 'uncool' as trying to be 'cool'! Be yourself, maintain Biblical standards and follow in Jesus' footsteps.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Encourage and help each other...' 1 Thessalonians 5:11 CEV<br /><br /><p>We all spend far too much time comparing ourselves to others, wishing we had their looks/skills/friends/family/life (circle as appropriate). And we all need to stop, right now. Honestly, it's damaging. That person whose physique you wish was yours? That person whose job or grades you wish you had? Even that person whose faith you wish you could muster? Yeah, they probably don't see themselves that rosily. In fact, they wish they had your beautiful smile (they think that wonky tooth is cute). You're you, and you're never going to be anyone else. It's only going to discourage you wishing that you could be. </p>
<p><i>'</i><i>...God created man in His own image...</i><i>'</i><i> </i>(Genesis 1:27 NIV) You've heard it a million times, but really think about it. God made you to be a reflection of Him, and He's incredible. (You know what that means. Yup, you = incredible. Ok, maybe not at this very moment and to the same extent but yes, a reflection of His amazing character.</p>
<p>The more time you spend trying to take on His ways, the more you'll become the person He made you to be. The nearer you draw to God, the more like Him you'll become. And, being 'made in His image', the more like Him we are, the more truly we are our true selves. </p>
<p>Get close to God and you'll start mirroring his qualities in your own life. The Bible says,<i> &quot;</i><i>Love... protects... trusts... hopes... perseveres.&quot;</i> (1 Corinthians 13:4;7 NIV) Instead of making comparisons, ask God to help you see yourself and others with the sort of love He does.</p>

Joshua 1:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>God said this to Joshua: 'Moses my servant is dead ...get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give [you]...I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses... you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.' (Joshua 1: 2-6 NIV) The lead-up to this point was a rough ride for Joshua. Previously, he spent a load of time serving Moses, and did it graciously and attentively. That's totally admirable, seeing as they spent all that time wandering around a scorching desert with a bunch of guys who complained about everything (check the Old Testament, the people of Israel could be a right moany lot). </p>
<p>It would've been easy for Joshua to become an impatient rebel along with them, but he didn't. He didn't get pushy or irritated. He used that time as a preparation. Every day in the desert prepared him for the mahooooosive task of leading Israel into the Promised Land. God never ever wastes experience. Every single thing you've been through, including all the stuff that makes zero sense right now, is preparation for what God's got in store. At the end of his life Joshua was able to say to the Israelites: 'Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled...' (Joshua 23:14 NIV) So prepare yourself so the God who came through for Joshua can come through for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised...' Joshua 1:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>When God says 'I promise', you can be sure it's going to happen. However, don't think that means He's going to throw it at you gift-wrapped, while you sit twiddling your thumbs kinda-sorta-maybe hoping He might just come through for you. Joshua got given 'every place where [he] set [his] foot...' (Joshua 1:3 NIV), which means he had to step out in faith before God's promise became reality (Literally. He physically had to step out. One foot in front of the other. Yeah.) That same principle stands for you. When God makes you a promise, you've got to claim it.</p>
<p>You've got to make that choice to accept it as fact. It's already yours if you're willing to own it. But that doesn't mean it's always easy to see those promises through. Joshua had to get through 31 kings, 7 nations and giants (tall-type guys built like fridges whose heads would knock against the light fittings you'd need an extension ladder to reach. <em>Gulp</em>.) All to get Israel to the land God had promised to them. You'll face scary challenges on your way to God's promises too. But take heart, brave warrior, 'The Lord... is the One who goes ahead of you. He will be with you.' (Deuteronomy 31:8 NAS)</p>
<p>His promise is already fulfilled; you've just got to be daring enough to act on it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Tim 1-3, Lk 8:40-56, Ps 1, Prov 19: 9-11<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62135&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?' Psalm 27:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Stronghold. Strange word, we know. But when you really get into it, it makes a lot of sense. 'Strong'... 'hold'... someone or something that holds you safely and with strength. God's definitely the one to do that. When your life is all wrapped up in Him, anything coming at you has got to get through Him before it can touch you. Victor Hugo, the old French guy who wrote <em>Les Mis</em>é<em>rables</em> (yep, it was a novel to start with, but, nope, the novel doesn't have songs) wrote something cool about God. It was this: 'Have courage for the great sorrows of life, and patience for the small ones. And when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace. God is awake.' Think about it:</p>
<p>God doesn't sleep. Ever. He literally always has your back. Joshua faced a truckload of enemies (that includes those giants, so probably several truckloads of enemies, actually) whilst working towards God's promise of land for Israel. He still got there fine. God promised him 'I will never leave you nor forsake you' (Joshua 21:43-45 NIV), and that's why Joshua couldn't lose. While you're out fighting for God's promises, He'll fight for you.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no one and absolutely nothing that is so big God can't handle it for you. If you let Him be the stronghold of your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Tim 4-6, Lk 9:1-17, Ps 42:1-5, Prov 19:12-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62137&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[God]... will not... leave you without support...' Hebrews 13:5 AMP<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we looked at Psalm 27:1 NIV which says, '...The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?' God is your protector, provider and Saviour whether you're single or not. Yeah, it always seems that everyone around you has found that special someone just when you most need a friend. But Paul says this: 'Be satisfied with your present circumstances... God...will not...leave you without support.' Sure it's hard to believe He knows best even when it hurts to be so unwanted. But, long before we feel so lonely it seems unbearable, we should cry out to Jesus. He's 'close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.' (Psalm 34:18 NIV) The risk we run in loneliness is that we start to wonder what's wrong with us. We try to become someone else in the hope of attracting the right person. Then we start asking a whole parade of fearful questions: Am I good-looking enough? Charming and talkative enough? Or too talkative? God made us who we are and, if He wants to include some years of singleness along the way, it's not because He doesn't care about us. On the contrary, He will never leave us without support.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:10, 1 Th 2:13-3:5, 1 Cor 4:11-13, Rev 6:9-11<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62138&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love never fails...' 1 Corinthians 13:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Forming a negative opinion based on appearance takes less than seven seconds (or so science says). That means, in less time than you can read this paragraph (maybe even this sentence), you can meet someone and decide you don't like them. But John writes: '...Anyone who does not love his brother... cannot love God...' (1 John 4:20 NIV)</p>
<p>That means that if you go around dismissing people, you 'cannot love God'. That is tough. Crazy tough. People can be really difficult to love. You try so hard to be nice and they're just... <em>ugh</em>. Reality check. There are times when you're hard to love, too. God sees you when you do those really rubbish things. The things that, if anyone else did them, would make you facepalm and sigh. Yet God still loves you as fiercely as a mother lion loves her cubs.</p>
<p>Actually more so. He loves you enough to give up His life for you, and He's raring to share that ability to forgive and love. If you ask Him, He'll teach you how to love other people as fiercely as He does. And if you unleash that kind of love on the world, something incredible is going to happen.</p>
<p>And here's how to do it practically: you know that annoying person, the one you pretend not to see when you pass by them. Pray that God will do good things for them.</p>
<p>And don't stop there.</p>
<p>Next time you see that person, say hello, ask them how they are, and really listen to the answer. Maybe even have a whole conversation. You might surprise yourself when you discover that love works.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zeph 1-3, Lk 9:18-33, Ps 42:6-11, Prov 19:15-17<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62139&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...The Lord does not look at the things man looks at...' 1 Samuel 16:7 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>God had David earmarked for King. However, his own family didn't see any royal potential. A prophet called Samuel came to his family home, looking for the guy who was to be King. David's dad showed Samuel the eldest son, Eliab.</p>
<p>Eliab looked pretty impressive - he was a general in the army. Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed stands here...' But the Lord said to Samuel, &quot;Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.&quot;' (1 Samuel 16: 6-7 NIV)</p>
<p>It would've been easy for David to give up and settle into the role of musically-talented little brother. But he didn't. He grew into God's call for him - to be a king - and outran the expectations of his family. He went on to do astounding things for God. It can be tough when the people around you tie you up with their expectations. But if you ask God to show you His opinion, you'll have the power to shake off those expectations. You'll see you were made by the Master of all craft to be a prized and powerful creature. If you give yourself over to His opinions, you'll see that you are a custom-crafted piece of the most valued design in nature.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Lord... gives you the ability to produce wealth...' Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV</p>
<p>God holds back '...no good from those who do what is right.' (Psalms 84:11 NLT) But it's important to realise He's actually the source of all our blessings. And on this one, we all fall short!</p>
<p>More isn't always better. In fact, your dependence on God lessens as your dependence on things increases. When we've got less, we focus on God, but when we've got more, we tend to focus on getting still more.</p>
<p>Yet God wants us to depend on Him, not on our possessions. So He cautioned all of us, 'When...you may say... &quot;My power and...strength...have produced this&quot;...remember the Lord...gives you the ability to produce wealth...' (Deuteronomy 8:13-18 NIV)</p>
<p>Yep, wealth comes from God because He's the one who gives us the ability to produce it. His principles haven't changed. The Bible doesn't say that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek 'things'. No - it says, '...He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NKJ) Bottom line: if you're depending on anything but God, you'll always struggle in some area of life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.' John 15:12 NIV</p>
<p>What makes a good friend? We can make a checklist of our own but it'd be good to look at what Jesus said. He had a few really hard-to-swallow teachings on the subject. Try John 15:13 NIV for size: 'Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.' This is not any sort of a soppy tagged-in-a-facebook-montage-pic of 'love', but the kind that Jesus modelled. The kind that asks us to make sacrifices. (Check back to last Thursday's reading, if you've forgotten that Jesus asks us to make daily sacrifices on behalf of others.) You might never have to catch a grenade or jump in front of a train to save your friends, but there's plenty we can do - starting with time and effort.</p>
<p>Why, though? Why bother giving up yourself for others? Well, one of the problems we all can face is opting to be superficial. When we're little more than skin-deep, we shrink our friendship-quality. Opening up to a trusted mate is good (girls have usually been a bit better at this than guys). Having a person you can totally trust is a bit of a lifesaver, and a life-giver, in the long run. Have you got one? And are you one to someone else?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h6>'When I was a child...When I became a man...' 1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV</h6>
<p>Every birthday, it feels like there should be some sort of fanfare and that someone should hand you the golden keys of maturity. (We know, we feel that too.) Unlucky. It's not going to happen. 'Reaching maturity' is a very (very, very) long and complex process. There's rarely a moment, other than on TV, that anyone ever gets a 'You're a man now!' experience (ok, pipe down, Bear Grylls). The journey towards feeling all wise and grown-up can leave you in a confusing no-man's land, between the safe, clear world of childhood and the responsibility and authority of 'grown-up' life. People tell you to 'grow up already' while others are saying, 'you can't do that, you're too young'. It's fine to be thrown by it all; it can be perplexing and majorly stressful. But there's a solution. 'Those who are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish...' (Psalm 92:13 NKJ) That means that stressing won't help you grow: putting down roots in God will. If you chase God, and trust Him to take care of stuff, He'll give you direction and peace about your place in life. If you live for Him and have a little patience, He'll help you grow into that maturity. Sweet deal.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit...' Romans 8:27 NIV</p>
<p>Now we’re getting to the bit that seems hardest when we’re back at the starting line. With pure motives and obedience to God sorted (see yesterday), anyone’s set to serve God. Once you’ve got your heart sorted, here’s a heads–up on practical steps that naturally follow:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Your priorities</em>. Will change, big time. Jesus submitted His schedule to God, right from His carpentry job to taking time for a last supper with His friends in the middle of His most nerve–wracking 24 hours on earth. Would He have preferred an easier set of options? Maybe, but what mattered most to Him was what God wanted for Him.</p>
<p>(2)<em> Your sacrifices</em>. When your heart’s right, you’ll make them. Jesus made loads more sacrifices than dying for us on the cross. He knew how to give His life away in daily practical (doing stuff! &amp;lt;— important) ways. ‘Whoever wants to be My disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.’ (Luke 9:23–24 NIV)</p>
<p>This tells us the sacrifice He made on the cross flowed over into a lifestyle. You won’t find a verse about Him refusing to give time up for others. <em>Not. Easy.</em> In fact, we’ve used Jesus as our prime example today. Not only because we’re Christians, but also because He was sorted in ways we very often aren’t. Talk to the One who searches hearts and ask what you should be sacrificing today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Jesus knew what they were thinking [in their hearts].' Luke 11:17 GNT</p>
<p>So we've opened our heart to God: confident in Him (Tuesday's reading), willing to obey Him (Wednesday) and putting Him first every time (yesterday). Mentally check up on these things every day and you'll be on your way to true discipleship.</p>
<p>Now, in the last reading in this series, we want to turn it round 180 degrees. Other people are going to love it when we've been letting God do His thing.</p>
<p><em>You'll be freely forgiving them</em>: 'Forgive as the Lord forgave you.' (Colossians 3:13) People just won't expect you to let their mistakes go without a condition attached! The profound work God's been up to in you will hit them: 'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.' (Galatians 5:22-23) People notice that and it's refreshing. It's like you're wearing the beauty of Jesus' life and others will unconsciously sense it. They'll reap the benefits of your prayers for them. Want to see friends who don't like the Christian agenda come to know Jesus?: 'I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people.' (1 Timothy 2:1 NIV)</p>
<p>BTW, the Bible references today are taken from books written by the apostle Paul. He's a cracking example of someone who opened His life to God's scalpel (ex Christian-basher turned missionary: serious surgery there), and shared his changed heart with others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Lord searches every heart and understands every motive.' 1 Chronicles 28:9 NIV</p>
<p>Ok, now for some potential outcomes to God's heart surgery we haven't touched on yet. Heavier stuff; things that can go unnoticed if we aren't honest with ourselves. Praying for God to change you is going to mean you notice things that need changing, like:</p>
<p><em>Pure motives</em>: Especially in areas where you consistently slip yourself. That person you look down on, the swearing that's become habitual with that group of friends, that intimacy you shouldn't have with your boy/girl-friend. Do you stop-drop-and-roll away from your sin as soon as God blows that nagging whistle in your conscience? If our hearts are truly open to God, we'll confess sin by name and turn away.</p>
<p><em>Obedience</em>: Letting God perform spiritual heart-surgery means you're vulnerable. Very vulnerable. If that's uncomfortable for you, you might never get to a point where you're willing to let God renew you. Everyone hates being corrected at first, especially if you've come from a background where everyone's critical. But this is about construction, not destruction. The Psalmist prayed, 'Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.' (Psalm 139:23-24 NKJ) The way everlasting is being offered to you, in your life, right now. Make whatever change you need to in order to receive it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My times are in Your hand...' Psalm 31:15 NKJ</p>
<p>Opening your life to God so He can see right into every part of it - especially the parts you're not proud of - is the best and only way to keep your feet firmly set on the right track. Attempting to make your way through big decisions - your choice of uni or job, starting a relationship, which church to go to, life-stuff - is best approached from a heart that has been open to God's surgery.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, we'll be looking at the benefits of getting beyond the awkwardness of opening that dark corner of your heart to God's scalpel of faith. Here are some major basics to get us off the ground: First, opening up to God means you'll feel sure in your salvation. If you're keeping things from God, then you might not really feel as confident in Him as you could. On top of that, your devotional life will take shape. It's great you're reading <em>word4U2day</em> but, as you'll know, there's no substitute for getting stuck into God's Word. (That's why we have the <em>SoulFood </em>Bible reading plan with each reading... so you can get through the Bible in a year.)</p>
<p>After having your life refashioned by God, there probably won't be much room left for bragging. Humility will help others as much as it helps you - are you quick to let others off the hook when you're the one who hasn't got it right? How easy do you find it to celebrate others' success, even if it means yours will go unnoticed? As you are waiting to get where God wants you to be, build others so He will build you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Your Word is truth.' John 17:17 NIV</p>
<p>At the back of your head maybe you're thinking you could be doing more to get yourself - mind, emotions, all that - into Bible reading. But we've been friends a while and it'd be awkward to bring it up now. Well, no worries.</p>
<p>We've gone ahead and written today just for you...</p>
<p>One proven and helpful way to get better at Bible reading is an old practice where you simply slow down. Over 5 - 10 minutes, read a chosen verse or two of the Bible, slowly. Listen out for a word or section that touches your heart. In silence, repeat it over to yourself (repeating brings your whole attention to it.) Pray your distracting thoughts and concerns up to God, and let Him speak to you through what you've read. An example of how this kind of approach changes minds: in the 1950s in South America, some people who were too poor to own individual Bibles got together to read Scripture in groups. For them, the words of Scripture were their final authority. One day they read that God was a God who 'raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap.' (Psalm 113:7 ESV) They quickly realised He was for them, and could no longer live within oppression. Here we live in a country where the Bible is easily available. Are we going to use it to let it transform our lives like they did? What changes would you have to make in your life, if you allowed the Bible to be your final authority?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...The Word of God which...effectively works in you...' 1 Thessalonians 2:13 NKJ</p>
<p>Ever got so attached to your mobile you genuinely thought you could hear it go off when you were rooms away or outside? Or had that thing where you reach for it right before you get a text? You're just a bit too used to your handset. Your brain is listening for what it expects.</p>
<p>When you've spent enough time in your Bible, your brain will be expecting more too. It will begin to see deeper than the words, stories and rules on the surface. You go through them to get to God. After you've been reading and praying through it for a while, you intuitively learn God's heart patterns, you listen out for what to expect from His character, and in your real life decisions you can work out what to do much more simply. Wondering about who to hang out with? How much money to split between the needy and your own convenience? How far is too far in your relationship with Mr Cadbury's goods? When you've really got to grips with the Bible, God's truth becomes something you can feel in your bones, you can almost reach for it before you read: 'I will put My instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people.' (Jeremiah 31:33 NLT) It has 'effectively worked in you' and become second nature. So, listen out for a word or phrase of God's truth for you in your <em>SoulFood</em> today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You preserve me from trouble; You surround me with shouts of deliverance.' Psalm 32:7 ESV</p>
<p>Stormie Omartian grew up with a mother who told her she was worthless. She locked Stormie in a cupboard because she couldn't stand to see her daughter's face. Stormie writes: 'I was raised by a mentally ill mother... her behaviour left me with guilt, hopelessness, helplessness and deep emotional pain. By the time I was a young woman I was still locked in, only the boundaries were emotional not physical - a deep, ever-present pain which expressed itself through self-destruction and paralysing fear. Years later [with help from a Christian counsellor] I learned that unforgiveness as deeply rooted as mine... must be unravelled one layer at a time. One day I felt led to pray, &quot;Lord, give me a heart like Yours for my mother.&quot; Immediately I had a vision of her as a beautiful, fun-loving, gifted woman with no resemblance to the person I knew... I was seeing her the way God made her to be, not the way she'd become. In an instant I put together the pieces of her past - her mother's tragic death... the suicide of her beloved uncle and foster father, her feelings of abandonment, guilt, bitterness and unforgiveness... Touching the heart of God brought such forgiveness that when she died... I had no bad feelings. In fact, the more I forgave her the more God brought to mind good memories.'</p>
<p>Only God knows the history of those who hurt you, and how life has shaped them. To move on in your life, you may need to, like Stormie, pray a prayer of release and let go of the past.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Life is not measured by how much you own.' Luke 12:15 NLT</p>
<p>The good life that advertisements offer is all about owning more and more. But it's a trap. Any ad that says, 'Your hair could look like this!' is playing on your insecurity. Listen out: there's an underlying message that says, 'You're not good enough, and we'll make you better.'</p>
<p>Jesus calls out something totally different to the world's consumer choices. He just breezes right past the question of 'how much stuff is enough'. Life, for Him, is about getting a tight grip on your desires, and putting them in their right place. 'Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the Kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in Heaven that will never fail.' (Luke 12:32-33 NIV)</p>
<p>A life of listening to advertisements will get crushingly oppressive for your sense of worth. John Piper said, 'If the heart is satisfied with all that God is for us in Jesus, the power of sin [or ads...] to lure us away from the wisdom of Christ is broken.' Easily said, John, but what about that $0.99 app update for the level with the rainbow sweet things? Well, if God really is pleased to offer you a different way of life, even in tiny things, ask Him what it is! If He really has something better than the treadmill of buying stuff (and we think He does...), try finding out what it might be. God isn't opposed to you having money. He's just against anything taking His place in your life! He knows that 'Your heart will be where your treasure is.' (Matthew 6:21 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Seek His Kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.' Luke 12:31 NIV</p>
<p>What would you want to be doing if Jesus came back today? Living comfortably on your Xbox throne amid piles of stuff? Or honestly doing the best you can to make the lives of those less well-off than you in some way better? One author writes: 'God deals with us individually. What may be ok for some isn't necessarily ok for others... When Pastor Renny Scott began wrestling with this issue, he said, 'I just couldn't resolve the tension of living in a peaceful bedroom community while hell on earth was all around me in the form of hunger and poverty.' He went to Africa with World Vision, which was the beginning of involvement with the needs of others. Next he moved into the inner city... Then he took a church of 50 which met in a school cafeteria. When a deacon suggested they give the entire Sunday morning offering to missions, Scott swallowed hard - because his salary was included!</p>
<p>Eventually he and his wife came to grips with their lifestyle. Scott said, 'I had to pause and ask myself what I'd want to be doing if Christ returned today. And I found myself answering from Matthew chapter 24 and 25... to take my talents and invest them [where the need was].&quot;'</p>
<p>If you've been challenged by this reading, then next time you find yourself wanting to buy something you don't need, stop yourself. Use the money, like Renny Scott did, where the need is.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Daniel purposed in his heart...' Daniel 1:8 KJV</p>
<p>Just after Jesus' time, there was a church at Laodicea that started off well, then turned away from Him with a compromised, over-fed shrug. They had stuffed their faces with everything corrupt culture had to offer. 'I am... increased with goods,' they said, 'and have need of nothing.' (Revelation 3:17 KJV) Centuries before, a man of God called Daniel had settled the issue of culture-compromise for himself. So when he got a job that meant he could eat the most luxurious foods - that God had said he shouldn't - he could swat the appetiser trays away with ease. Joseph had too, so he could say no to Potiphar's sex-fiend of a wife when she made her advances.</p>
<p>If you think God might fail you, you'll never totally commit yourself to Him like those two did. Become used to His trustworthiness, even in simple things. Knowing that He'd come through for them when the king threatened to throw them in a fiery furnace, Daniel's friends said, '...Our God...is able to deliver us...and He will... But if not... we do not serve your gods...' (Daniel 3:17-18 NKJ) Have you given yourself over to compromise lately like the people of Laodicea? God's still wants to help you. Go to Him and ask for His forgiveness and also ask Him to help you do something that takes you in the opposite direction.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My times are in Your hand...' Psalm 31:15 NKJ</p>
<p>In the Book of Exodus, God's people were travelling through the desert. Moses was leading them to the home promised to them. Moses stopped at a mountain to talk with God, and frankly, took too long. Forty days. I mean, it was so long the only reasonable option for God's people seemed to be to just melt down a shedload of gold and make a giant golden cow.</p>
<p>As you do, right? That's how the story goes in Exodus 32. Understandably God wasn't fussed about His glittery replacement from Farmville. The man who'd let it happen, Aaron, saw the big mistake they'd all made. But he tried to explain, saying, 'You know how prone these people are to evil.' (Exodus 32:22 NIV) Like, as if they turned their attention from God for a second, they were (literally) distracted by the nearest shiny object. Is it a good excuse? When we feel like God hasn't been close recently and we stray into sin, do we think: 'Well God, You know me. I did something a bit bad, but I'm only human.' Or do we hold up our hands and say, 'I've made a huge mistake...' What if sin wasn't the natural thing to expect from ourselves, and we could hold ourselves to a higher standard? Paul wrote, 'Let us not be weary in well doing.' (Galatians 6:9 KJV) He expected that Christians could grow to be consistently, magnetically drawn to choosing good things, not bad. Do you? Because what you think impacts how you behave.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you...' Jeremiah 1:8 NKJ</p>
<p>Jeremiah wrote: 'The word of the Lord came to me, saying: &quot;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified* you...&quot; Then said I: &quot;Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.&quot; But the Lord said to me: &quot;Do not say, 'I am a youth,' for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you,&quot; says the Lord. Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and... said: &quot;Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeremiah realised that God was looking at him - and had been even before he was born. At first he felt ashamed. But God showed him that His gaze was full of special attention and stupendous love. Now, He looked Jeremiah straight in the eyes, and told him, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>When you know that you are seen by God, the faces of those who'd look down on you, in real life or in your imagination, fade. We matter, because we're seen. No matter how much other people make out you're embarrassing, it's different with God. He's not embarrassed by you at all. Because whenever He looks at a Christian, He sees Jesus and that you are sanctified* through Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Get yourself ready!' Jeremiah 1:17 NIV</p>
<p>Remember that phase when you were a kid and felt too awkward to talk to your parents' friends? Well, Jeremiah was in a similar situation: he thought he was too young to talk with God. Sometimes we think our beginnings are too humble (or broken) for God. Here's the thing though: we all came from a less-than-perfect background. So what do we do?</p>
<p>First, it's not worth giving time of day to the 'Christian' attitude of 'I'm just ordinary.' You were created by Almighty God, for good works. That's far from ordinary! And no matter where you've come from it's still true. You're never just the product of your upbringing.</p>
<p>Secondly, however shambolic your family upbringing was, you can learn valuable lessons. You can know to avoid the mistakes of those who did it the wrong way, and follow those who did it the right way. CS Lewis reminds us that 'the real Son of God is at your side. He is beginning to turn you into the same kind of thing as Himself.' He can use those the very people you've grown up with to get your character growing towards perfection. Hope is always the last word in Christianity. You're never trapped.</p>
<p>Jeremiah told God that he wasn't old enough, couldn't speak well enough and was scared of the opposition. God's response was: 'Get yourself ready!' He promised to be with Jeremiah and, if you commit yourself to Him, He'll be with you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Lord...said to me, Now, I have put My words in your mouth.' Jeremiah 1:9 NIV</p>
<p>Jeremiah's encounter with God shows us how God puts something new into fearful minds. Many new Christians first feel His presence as a great big wash of well-being.</p>
<p>New research has shown that neglect by parent-figures can damage kids' brain development, but love, when it is consistently felt, writes out those dark, damaged spaces. ('Perfect love casts out fear,' remember that from 1 John 4:18?) Reminding yourself of the love of God can bring deep, real healing to traumatic parts of your past, so that you can get going on your new life with Him, full of new peace and joy.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Holy Spirit can kickstart new habits. He brings seemingly dry Bible facts from your head to life in your heart, where they actually blow through your being like a refreshing breeze. Like this one: 'Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.' (2 Corinthians 3:17 NIV) In the morning you can remind yourself that because He is with you, you can say, 'I actually do believe these things about myself. I am who God says I am. I can live freely!' That's right: you're not who others say you are; you're who God says you are! Be yourself; you can't be anybody else! Do what God says you can do. Just get in agreement with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Press toward the goal for the prize...' Philippians 3:14 NKJ</p>
<p>In the book of Nehemiah, God chose people to rebuild the ruined city He lived in at the time. How could they stay motivated to keep on working in crumbled remains? Well, they knew, even then, that God loved the city. They knew, while staring at debris-strewn ground, in a city far from completed, that the heart of God was for it. 'Look at that rubbish tip,' the critics cried. 'It's not a city wall, it's just a bunch of bricks in a pile!' If only they'd known what God was thinking. 'Oh yes! I <em>do</em> love that wall.'</p>
<p>The love God should have for a spotless individual is on you, today, because of Jesus. When we feel guilt in our Christian life from lack of progress, or some glaring character failure, we can find ourselves thinking, &quot;God can't love me yet. Not, like, '<em>love me</em>' love me.&quot; There is frustrating sin clogging up our holiness. There are gates and walls still unbuilt in our lives.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>And still.</p>
<p>The proud smile of a Creator on His finished creation is on you. You are bathed in light. There is room to grow in, an expansive space of God's acceptance. Maybe it's not only about 'pressing on' but also about rejoicing, flowering, blooming... into the whole and holy person He's said you are.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'As an eagle stirs up its nest...so the Lord...led him...' Deuteronomy 32:11-12 NKJ</p>
<p>A mother eagle knows that if she waits for her young to get out of the nest and fly on their own initiative, it'll never happen! So she pushes them out.</p>
<p>So what about that comfort zone of yours then? We resist moving outside our comfort zone because we don't want to fall on our faces. And when we stay inside our comfort zones, it's the easiest thing in the world to become complacent. Imagine if you hadn't made the hard decision to brave the cold and move out of the comfy-zone of your bed this morning. You'd get sucked into that warm-bed-magnet-trap. And you'd have got absolutely nothing done today at all.</p>
<p>Eager to get going but don't know how? June Munday shares about her 'friend [who] started a café for homeless people... when I asked him about this &quot;calling&quot; he said: &quot;Well, you hardly need to wait for that. There's plenty in the Bible telling you to feed the hungry.&quot;' You don't have to wait for your own dreamy vision or calling. God's dreams for the world, as seen in the Gospel stories of Jesus, give us loads to aim for.</p>
<p>Oh, and the mother eagle? After encouraging the little ones to leave, she carries them safely onto their flying lesson. God's got you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I am doing a great work...' Nehemiah 6:3 NKJ</p>
<p>Haven't read yesterday? (Did you get to the half-yearly review bit and think, 'Hey, waaaaay too heavy,' and decide to update your Facebook status instead? Right then, no excuses. Pop back and have a read. No, not Facebook. <em>word4U2day</em>!)</p>
<p>Back? Cool. This 'mast' business then, what's it all about? Masts aren't just for when things are rough, like storms; masts give a ship its strength when the sun is out and the wind is in its favour. God's presence doesn't just secure us in safety, it also means we can do good things - seriously good things - that we couldn't do without Him. 'The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you... and you will be changed into a different person.' (1 Samuel 10:6 NIV) When we share God with friends, pray to see people freed from sin, and pray openly for healing, we need to know that there is going to be something that will make things happen! We have to 'screw our courage to the mast' (with apologies to Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth). If God is that 'mast', then we don't have to worry about our own lack of ability or experience. A fierce life of faith doesn't mean that we must be famous Christians or big church leaders - it means only clinging to God, and trying to live in a way that only makes sense if He is real. That way we'll be 'doing a great work.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him.' Hebrews 6:10 NIV</p>
<p>So it's July 1st - not usually the time when we start reviewing the year. But if we wait until the normal time around end of December, there won't be an opportunity to make any useful changes. So. How's it going so far? More good than bad? A mixed bag? Some nagging stuff you'd rather not remember? With the way our brains are, we often zoom in on our bad moments. So maybe we're looking back and remembering more of our own selfish actions than the broad action of God through us. 'Where's God been so far this year? Should I have worked harder to let Him in? Will it all just happen again, whatever I do?'</p>
<p>But no matter what your half-yearly review looks like, the headline stubbornly remains: God's unfailing, unflapping kindness, tied to us like a sail to a mast. 'God is not unjust' - and more than that, He is so much more than fair to us that it takes a while getting used to.</p>
<p>Sailors lashed themselves to their sail masts in storms. We should lash ourselves to God's character from day to day, month to month, year to year, no matter what each brings. That way, we can remember who He is when change comes. We remember how kind He is to us in our worst times, and how He draws out all the character and growth He can from even the smallest good moments we muster up. Even those brief good moments mean the world to Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... A brother is born for adversity.' Proverbs 17:17 NIV</p>
<p>Nehemiah lived about 2400 years ago. He left a life of privilege to help rebuild the walls of ruined Jerusalem. But not everyone was happy about his efforts. A local bigwig, Sanballat, didn't want Nehemiah to succeed. 'Sanballat ...sent to me, saying, &quot;Come, let us meet together&quot;...But they thought to do me harm. So I sent messengers to them, saying, &quot;I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you&quot;? But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.' (Nehemiah 6:2-4 NKJ)</p>
<p>Sometimes your answer just has to be 'No!' Any time you stop the work God has given you to do, you've sent the devil a signal his strategy is working. So you can expect more of the same. Think: if God can deliver you in times of trouble, surely He can defend you in times of misunderstanding! So get back up on the wall He has called you to build and keep working. Don't get distracted. Don't listen to critical people, be cautious in dealing with cautious people but value the people who are committed to seeing God's work advance and you too!</p>
<p>'A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.' Recognise such people and build your life around them because they are a gift from God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'But Paul shook the snake off...' Acts 28:5 NIV</p>
<p>In the Book of Acts, Luke wrote what happened after a shipwreck: 'The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper...fastened itself on his hand. When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, &quot;This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.&quot; But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.' (Acts 28:2-6 NIV)</p>
<p>You know how fickle people are? Here's a classic case: one moment Paul is seen as an evil criminal, the next he may as well have been elevated to Heaven. But Paul shows us how to avoid both extremes: 'Shake it off!' Yup.</p>
<p><i>Shake it off!</i> We should beware of those who change their mind about us when our circumstances change. We need to build our lives on those who believe the best about us, and want to bring it out. Behind Paul's spectacular success in ministry you will find people who never stopped believing in him. Priscilla, Aquila, Epaphroditus, Onesiphorus and many others. Look for such people in your life; they'll bless you. And they're out there!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...What does my Lord say to His servant?' Joshua 5:14 NKJ</p>
<p>Martin Luther wrote, 'I know whenever I have prayed earnestly that I have been amply heard, and have obtained more than I prayed for. God indeed sometimes delayed, but at last He came.' Joshua certainly learned that. He knew that the only way to conquer the Promised Land was for Jericho to fall first. Well, conveniently for Joshua, the angelic commander of the Lord's army showed up, then God gave him a very clear battle plan to take down Jericho. Weird plan, but it worked. (God's totally cool like that... His weird plans actually work when we follow them.)</p>
<p>You see, the battle was God's. That doesn't mean Joshua sat on his rear and waited for God to make the walls of Jericho vanish in a cloud of smoke. It meant that, after he sought God in prayer, Joshua was given the means to win his battle. Whatever 'Jericho' is in your life today, whatever walls you need to break down, your battle belongs to the Lord too. Joshua was strong and courageous and yet even he could not defeat Jericho in his own strength. His victory came in the bending of knees. The fiercest of conflict is won in prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Thus far the Lord has helped us.' 1 Samuel 7:12 NKJ</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll be half way through 2014. Did you make any New Year resolutions back on January 1? With God, you don't need to wait until a New Year to start again. Lamentations 3:22-24 NCV reminds us every day is a clean slate with God: '<em>The Lord</em><em>'</em><em>s love never ends;</em><em> His mercies never stop. They are new every morning; Lord, Your loyalty is great. I say to myself, &quot;</em><em>The Lord is mine, so I hope in Him</em>.&quot;' No need to 'drown your sorrows' (in the chocolate hidden at the bottom of the tin). Missed chances can be returned to you: Jonah got a second chance, so did Peter, David, Thomas, Samson... the list goes on. When it comes to epic failures, God says, 'I, I am the One who forgives all your sins, for my sake; I will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NCV)</p>
<p>As we mark this half-yearly milestone, make a list of God's faithfulness to you so far in life. Put it in your Bible so you can see it regularly. Whatever this year has felt like so far, God has been with you, and He is faithful for the rest of the year too. So learn from the past, but don't repeat its mistakes. It's ok to look back, but don't drive looking in the rear view mirror... because you're bound to crash.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT</p>
<p>Jesus said, 'My yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light.' (Matthew 11:30 NLT) Lots of those who heard these words were farmers who used oxen to plough their fields. They understood what Jesus was saying because the yoke was one of their most important bits of equipment. It was a wooden attachment that fitted between two oxen so that their full pulling power could be released. They wouldn't dream of putting an ill-fitting yoke on their oxen that caused them to chafe, or pull the plough in a wonky line. Now, when you hear Jesus using these kinds of illustrations you mustn't go too far in examining them - Jesus doesn't think his followers are cows (sheep perhaps but not cows, lol) and don't take the 'pulling power' phrase literally! This illustration is about Jesus offering people rest for their souls (Matthew 11:29) from the heavy burden of the way they were living their lives without Him. So why do so many of us not feel an instant desire to get out there and get on with Jesus? Quite simply because we've spent so long trying to make it on our own and not being the person we were made to be. We're also not doing the things we were made to do and so the 'yoke' Jesus gives us feels totally weird at first. The only way to make it feel less weird is just to just accept God's grace and get in the groove! In no time you'll be asking yourself, 'Why didn't I get started sooner?' Obedience isn't hard work, it's what you were made for! Have you come to Jesus yet? Is He Lord of your life?</p>
<p>If not, it's time to look at http://word4u2day.com.au/Christianity.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT</p>
<p>A guy trying to win a girl will do anything for her. She'll call him and say, 'I know it's late, you're tired and it's raining, but could you come over and change my flat tyre?' 'Sure, I'll be right over,' he says. And over he comes with a smile. Now, fast forward. They've been married 10 years; he's at home with this same woman whom he once chased around everywhere like a puppy. She asks him to get up off the sofa and do something for her. She has to say it three or four times - you'd think she'd asked him to cut off his leg the way he moans and groans! Then she gets upset. What's happening? What was once a pleasure has become a pain - because the love has cooled off! Our problem isn't really obedience, it's keeping our love for Christ strong. Only love makes obedience a joy. Less obedience quite simply means less love. Lots of people allow the love to fizzle out of the Christian life, so that it just becomes a set of rules. But God has designed the Christian life around relationships, not rules. Rules without relationship lead to coldness. Jesus sent an angel to the Christians at Ephesus to say: 'I have this against you, that you have left your first love.' (Revelation 2:4 NAS) In other words, 'You don't love Me like you used to.' Then He commanded them to return to the point before they'd let their love for Him slip. Is Christ saying the same thing to you today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He...ran out of the house.' Genesis 39:12 NIV</p>
<p>Your eyes are wired to your brain, physically: the optic nerve stretches from the back of the eye right into your head. Your very own high-speed, fibre-optic, in-head broadband. Every image and word you see shoots down it like a dart to your brain, and plants itself into your thoughts.</p>
<p>So, what happens when your eyes land on something that plants 'sex' in your mind?</p>
<p>Well, simply, that wrong kind of sex becomes a part of your thoughts - yep, a part of you. God crafted sex as a deeply personal way to give ourselves to someone as part of only-the-most-serious commitment. It's made to live in healthy, lifelong marriage.</p>
<p>When we take in mental images of sex, it takes it out of a secure, shared, equal, giving-all-of-yourself-to-each-other trust and makes it all about indulging in self-pleasing lust. Let's stop there: this isn't a telling off from <em>word4U2day</em>. This is a warning sign for your safety. Girls. Guys. What you're taking in changes how your brain understands sex. It's God's plan for us to understand it as a celebration of a couple expressing lifelong love, but it is turned into warped expectations about a self-pleasing party. We can actually be divided from that special someone we might one day marry (which is heartbreaking). Experiencing (including 'just messing around' or 'just seeing') sex in the wrong way tears at the tissue of our spirit. Run out of the space where you're open to that. Just as Joseph did when he was tempted. See Joseph's story in Genesis 39:1-18. And don't forget to check out the reward of his faithfulness in Genesis 41:38-45.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Hold fast what is good.' 1 Thessalonians 5:21 NKJ</p>
<p>We're in a society that's moved away from the ideas of absolute good and absolute evil. So having something concrete to stand for will set you apart (in a really good way).</p>
<p>The Bible calls us to stick with the boundaries set by our forerunners (see Proverbs 22:28). If we stay within the age-old knowledge of God's law, we also draw on age-old power to change our world through obedience to God.</p>
<p>Obedience may sound like a bit of a stuffy word (or, you know, a dog training thing), but it's the foundation of a God-centred life. The really old root of the word obedience is a mixture of 'ob', <em>to be near</em>, and 'audio', <em>to hear</em>. If you are close to someone, and hear an instruction from them, 'obedience' is the natural next step. If we live our lives in proximity to God, obeying His voice will be automatic upon hearing it. So, hear this from God's Word: '...hold on to what is good. Reject every kind of evil.' (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 NIV) God is absolutely good, no question, and His way is absolutely right, so hold on to it. In a world that's all at sea, bobbing along with changing boundaries and drifting with the tide, we can anchor ourselves in a steady-as-a-rock God and show a better (and unfailingly right) way to those floating along in the current.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...where sin increased, God's grace increased much more.' Romans 5:20 GNT</p>
<p><em>'</em><em>Who made God then?</em><em>'</em><em> </em><em>'</em><em>If God exists why is there so much suffering in the world?</em><em>'</em><em> </em><em>'</em><em>Christians are mostly hypocrites.</em><em>'</em><em> </em><em>'</em><em>Religion is outdated and causes wars.</em><em>'</em><em> </em><em>'</em><em>Christianity is a crutc</em><em>h for weak people.</em><em>'</em><em> </em><em>'</em><em>How can you know what</em><em>'</em><em>s really true?</em><em>'</em></p>
<p>Have you ever had questions and statements like these flung at you, leaving you unsure how to respond? Maybe you've gotten discouraged and been tempted to stop sharing your faith. Maybe you've even given up praying because of it. It happens to lots of Christians at school and in the workplace, and it can be quite demoralising.</p>
<p>In Galatians 1:13 NLT Paul writes; 'I violently persecuted God's church. I did my best to destroy it.' Paul had no thoughts of becoming a Christian. His intent was to destabilise the Church, and he never dreamt that one day he'd switch sides. But when God has a plan, He will do whatever it takes to fulfil it. So when Paul held the coats of Stephen's executioners, even then God was hatching a plan to make him one of the most remarkable Christians of all time.</p>
<p>Just like Paul, He has plans for your friends with all their objections, tricky questions, or questionable lifestyle choices. Tougher nuts have been cracked! God's grace will win out, so hold in there, and don't lose hope!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT</p>
<p>Paul says, '...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Most of us don't connect obedience with pleasure. We're used to obeying out of fear. Perhaps we had parents who made us obey 'just because I said so.' Now it's not wrong for parents to expect obedience from children, or teachers to expect cooperation from their class. But it's not the best definition or the highest motivation for obedience. The element that's missing is the 'want to' factor God built into each of us at the point of salvation. This takes the 'ought to/have to/better do it or else God will zap you' element out of it! It elevates obeying God to a level of an excited response because of all that He's done for you. Obedience is not something you have to manufacture it just needs to be activated because the desire is already present in you - it just needs to be activated. This will often come during a time of worship, prayer, or listening to a preacher.</p>
<p>Nobody wants their relationship with God to be like the boy who misbehaved and was told by his mother to go and sit in the corner. After a few minutes she called to him from the other room, 'Are you still sitting down?' He replied, 'Yes, I'm sitting down on the outside, but I'm standing up on the inside.' You could call that obedience, but actually it's rebellion. Real obedience is gladly doing on the outside, what you really want to do on the inside.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The sparrow has found a home...a place near Your altar.' Psalm 84:3 NIV</p>
<p>That feeling of loneliness we mentioned yesterday - remember it? For some people this is all they've known. Long-term friendlessness means deep suffering. How totally out of place is that in a good world created by a Father God?</p>
<p>Most churches are well-known for looking out for the homeless and poor; for helping society's forgotten people, and inviting them to a weekly service. For anyone who feels like an outcast, a real welcome to Church is more than just finding a spiritual home, it sometimes means feeling human for the first time.</p>
<p>Chronic loneliness also includes the single mother, and the socially awkward, unemployed kid who shows up and mumbles when you say hello. And what about those with severe autism? Jesus has an especially wide welcome for all of those we think are beyond our reach.</p>
<p>He came to '...seek and to save that which was lost.' (Luke 19:10 NIV) That includes those we count as too small or too seemingly insignificant for God to go looking for. He wants to give them a home in a safe place, in close proximity to others. And He wants other Christians to be serious about welcoming them there. And that means each one of us.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.' Matthew 10:29 NKJ</p>
<p>Life can be wonderful. To live on a world like ours, with all its wonder and complexity and joy, is a great gift. But sometimes life doesn't seem like a gift. Sometimes it can feel like an empty, friendless place. Jesus said, 'Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.' God knows when we fall, and His will is to lift us up again. Perhaps you were flying high and - <em>boom!</em> - life knocked you down, and you were left in the cold. A mistake. A secret. A betrayal. An illness. A death.</p>
<p>Life has a funny habit of stealing the wind beneath our wings. Sometimes we even feel so wing-clipped, we can't ever see ourselves in the sky again. The past plus our fear keep us on the ground.</p>
<p>God's an expert at throwing birds back into the sky. Simon Peter's wings were clipped by sin, guilt and regret. He denied Jesus three times yet God later restored him as His disciple and Apostle. Jonah fell through disobedience. His destiny was returned when he finally obeyed God and called Nineveh to repentance. David's plunge to the ground occurred because of his wandering eye. But he was restored from the Bathsheba episode to be forever known as 'a man after God's own heart.' The battle isn't over your past, it's over your future. God isn't looking to just point the finger today; He's looking to restore your soul. He wants you to fly again.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Your heavenly Father feeds them...' Matthew 6:26 NKJ</p>
<p>Dr Jay Adams tells the story of a guy who decided to quit worrying. When a friend noticed how chilled he looked and asked what he'd done, he said, 'It's simple; I just hired a guy to do my worrying for me.' Asked how much that cost, he replied, '$500 a day.'</p>
<p>'Where will you get the money?' his stressed friend asked. His reply? 'That's his worry, not mine!'</p>
<p>Jesus tells us to hand our worries over to Him; and He won't even charge us a single cent! He understands that we're anxious about money and clothes and having what we need. So He instructs us, 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot;...or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;' (Matthew 6:31 NIV) He's basically saying to you, 'Don't be a stress-head!' Instead, see how much more God's in control: 'Look at the birds...your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? ...God clothes the grass of the field... will He not much more clothe you?' (Matthew 6:26-30 NIV) God's a big God. He'll give you all you need. Stressing is for people who don't know Him, and don't have their security in Him. So today, instead of stressing about tomorrow, why don't you try focusing instead on 'His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well...' (Matthew 6:33 NIV) Trust that He's got it all in control.</p>

<p>The phrase 'God-given talent' can make people lazy. Well, yes. God did give us all talents. But they're more like seeds; they're the potential for full-grown talents. It's our job to grow them, nurture them, and ask God to direct them. We can't go on thinking God gave them to us to get us out of doing any hard work.</p>
<p>Really, that shouldn't be too difficult. 'God-given talents' quite often lie within the areas that excite us. The talents that He wants us to grow normally appeal to us, and fit within our abilities. We were, after all, crafted to fulfil them. Think about cats. When they see a gecko, they come alive. All big eyes and alert ears. They really love the chase. That's because they were crafted to hunt. So when they get the opportunity to hone that skill, they jump at the chance (and at the gecko). That's all because they love to do what God created them to do.</p>
<p>And you're the same. When you find the thing that you were made to do, the talent that you were built to love, you should want to jump at the chance to further it. You'll know by the excitement that it stirs up in your belly. It might not be jump-up-and-down-exciting, but you'll know deep down that you've found a passion. Just make sure that you put in the hard work to make it grow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'A [gift] is a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor: wherever he turns, he prospers.' Proverbs 17:8 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Your height isn't something you were consulted about. Natural features aren't things you worked at. Both were gifts you were born with. Yes, you can develop your appearance and a surgeon could alter it (although we'd suggest that you don't let that happen...), but you're <span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;>stuck</span> (actually, strike that, <em>blessed</em>...) with your core you-ness for the rest of your life. Here's the upshot - you're also stuck and blessed with the 'gift of God' that's in you.</p>
<p>You can't change that.</p>
<p>Solomon said that a gift is like a jewel to those who receive it; whatever way it's looked at, it sparkles with a glint of prosperity (Proverbs 17:8). But all gemstones need regular polishing and care. By working on and using your gifts, you're adding that extra bit of value and investing in your talent.</p>
<p>So invest in your talents, even when others won't support you. Louis Armstrong auditioned for music school and was asked to sing scales. But he could only sing two notes. So they wrote him off. But he said: 'There's music in me and they can't keep it out,' and went on to sell millions of records.</p>
<p>There's God-given gifts in you, and no-one can keep them down, unless you choose. So you have no excuse to let your talents go unused.</p>

<p><em>'</em><em>Then the man said, &quot;</em><em>Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot;</em><em> But Jacob replied, &quot;</em><em>I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot;</em><em> The man asked him, &quot;</em><em>What is your n</em><em>ame?&quot;</em><em> &quot;</em><em>Jacob,&quot;</em><em> he answered.Then the man said, &quot;</em><em>Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.&quot;</em>' (Genesis 32:26-28)</p>
<p>God forced Jacob to look at his true identity. He wrestled him into a revelation of who he was - not who others said he was. His parents gave him his name and others called him by it, so he believed that's who he'd always be. But God had a different plan for him.</p>
<p>Hear this: you are not who others say you are. Why should they label you? Determine who you are before God. Let Him determine the level of your success. Why should others be allowed to live at their highest potential, but not you? You are more than your past, more than your education or CV, more than the colour of your skin, more than your bank account, and more than your circumstances.</p>
<p>Tell those who talk down to you and devalue you, 'You're confusing me with somebody else. God says I am his son/daughter. And if I'm a son/daughter, then I have the right to be treated like one!' You ask, 'But is that true?' Yes, the Bible says that when you walk with God, you are part of his family (John 1:12) You are part of a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9). You are an overcomer (1 John 2:13-14). So dry your tears, lift your head, square your shoulders and begin walking in your God-given identity.</p>

<p><br />Mmm... processed beefy stuff on a sesame seed bun. Mmm... deep-fried pieces of something sorta chickeny. Back up two thousand years with your 'mmm'... roasted garden-bird on a twig. Hmm?</p>
<p>The junk food of Jesus' day was roast sparrow on a stick. You could buy two McSparrows for one copper coin or get five for an extra coin. Jesus used this weird old snack to illustrate God's care for us:<em> </em><em>'</em><em>Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God... Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than man</em><em>y sparrows.</em><em>'</em> (Luke 12:6-7 NKJ)</p>
<p>What was Christ's point? You are valuable in God's eyes! Do you feel like if you weren't around nobody would miss you? Many people, even high-profile ones, struggle with a sense of inferiority and inadequacy. When God called Jeremiah to be a prophet, he explained to God that he was afraid of people. So God said, 'Do not be afraid... for I am with you to deliver you.' (Jeremiah 1:8 NKJ) When you feel worthless, you conclude that others feel the same way too, so you begin to approach them fearfully, aggressively or even resentfully. What's the answer? Remembering your worth in God's eyes! There is no rejection with Him, only complete acceptance. You have a friend in high places. Jesus said, <em>'</em><em>...I have called you friends...</em><em>'</em><em> </em>(John 15:15 KJV) Will everybody accept you? Nope. So base your worth on God's love and acceptance, not on what you think others think.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I am like...a sparrow alone on the housetop.' Psalm 102:6-7 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p><br />The writer of Psalm 102 wrote, 'I am like...a sparrow alone on the housetop.' To be honest, we probably all know that feeling. We've sat there while our group of friends talks about something we don't get. We've gone somewhere new alone. We've awkwardly perched on the sidelines of a party/youth group, even if only once or twice. We all have our own tailored experience of loneliness. And it hurts. But it feels painful because we were built for more. The Bible opens with God playing matchmaker for Adam with Eve, and the final letters in the Bible are written from one group of friends to another. In the pages between, God pursues His people, but again and again they reject Him - that pretty much sums up the Old Testament. And then there's Jesus with His twelve best mates. One by one they turn their backs on him. Clearly we are not built to 'go it alone'. In Jesus, God has known the pain of loneliness. He died so you could be friends with Him. If you need them, He will bring other friends to you. If you need to, ask Him for company! Know that it's a big part of what He's made you for. Remember: Jesus spent a lot of time with the twentysomethings of his world. (The Apostle John is believed to have been in his teens when he first met Jesus.) So, look out for the person who's pushed to the side today, someone who gets ignored or excluded. Go ask them how their day's going (no matter how hard it is to pull yourself away from your own great convos).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I will pour out water to quench your thirst...' Isaiah 44:3 NLT</p>
<p>A Swedish company claims to have designed a device that recharges phones using just water. Yes, good old H<sub>2</sub>O. The device allows ten hours of phone life per tablespoon. Imagine that - a few drops of the clear stuff and you can talk on and on.</p>
<p>David prayed: 'My soul longs for you, as a parched land... Teach me the way in which I should walk.' (Psalm 143:6-8 NAS) Circumstances were dry for David and his soul was thirsty. (Would his prayer have been different if he was living in luxury surrounded by servants, do you think?) Not knowing where his next meal was coming from and sleeping outside every night radically changed his perspective. When life goes well, we can start to think that we're self-sufficient and forget God. But when we're running on empty, our souls cry out in thirsty desperation.</p>
<p>Prayer, the Church, Bible study, singing praise, meditation and reflection - they're all designed by God to recharge our spirit. God uses them to pour the soul-quenching Water of Himself into our aching spirits. If we starve ourselves of the charge-up time, we risk a spiritual and emotional (maybe even physical) blow out.</p>
<p>Taking the time to replenish yourself in God is vital.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Your face, Lord, I will seek.' Psalm 27:8 NKJ</p>
<p>Dr Alexander Maclaren was a great Scottish preacher. He believed the power of his preaching came from a regular habit: spending an hour each day alone with God. Sometimes he allowed others into his study, but they were never allowed to speak. Dr Maclaren would sit in a well-worn armchair with his Bible lying across his knees. Sometimes he'd read its pages, but mostly he'd just sit with his hand over his face. If he did read the Bible during that hour, he wouldn't read it as a student, or study it for sermons; during those times, 'he read it as a child would read a letter from an absent father, or your heart would drink in the words of a loved one from far away', so an observer noted.</p>
<p>How long do you spend with God? You can't expect to build a relationship with God in the five minutes you might give Him before your head hits the pillow. He deserves more of your time than that, and knows that none of our human-brains can process His wisdom and guidance in that timeframe and in our sleepy-headedness. Psalm 27:8 says, 'When You said, &quot;Seek My face,&quot; my heart said to You, &quot;Your face, Lord, I will seek.&quot;' Seeking takes patience and, guess what, time. Time when your brain's on top form. Sometimes, God wants that period of silent waiting before He speaks.</p>
<p>Today, open your Bible and spend some time praying and listening to God with and open heart. If you can't find the time, perhaps you need to head back to May 26 and reconsider that social media fast once more.</p>

<p>It's hard to get anything great built if you're determined to go it alone. We all need a team around us to achieve anything. However, it's impossible to work well with others if you can't give good, clear direction. Ed Rowell once said, 'A dream is a better future in need of an architect who will show others how to make it a reality,' which hits the nail on the head. Dreams and plans are great (when they're from God), but they're of no use if you can't explain them out of your head and into the ears of others. That's why you need to be an architect. You need to be under God's direction and to be able to take your vision and draw it out, clearly, in order for others to understand it. If you can only communicate to those helping you in a wishy-washy way, you'll get wishy-washy support. People don't give their best to something they can't figure out. If people don't have an in-focus goal to stare at, they'll wander off-course. 1 Corinthians 14:40 NKJ instructs us about our spiritual gifts: 'Let all things be done decently and in order.' That means that God wants us to be ordered and clear in our approach to making these dreams and visions reality. So, not only will people help you more, God will be behind you, helping you towards the goal.</p>

<p>An evangelist tells a story about a time he met a young person in church for the first time. The boy was fixed on the image of Jesus dying on a cross. The evangelist watched the boy. His gaze didn't move. The boy's mouth was gaping. The evangelist watched. The boy scrunched up his eyebrow and then relaxed. The evangelist watched some more. The boy scrunched then relaxed again. The evangelist sensed an opportunity. He walked over to the boy. Scrunch. He stood shoulder to shoulder with him. Relax. The boy remained fixated. The evangelist sensed the right moment. And then the boy asked, 'Who is it?' The evangelist wondered what he meant. 'The guy stretched out on that thing,' the boy said. 'Who is he? What's he doing?'</p>
<p>The boy had lived all of his thirteen years and he'd never seen a picture of Jesus. He'd heard the word before but only as a swear word. How can somebody in this country, in this day and age never have come across Jesus? What did he think Christmas was for? Or Easter? Hadn't he heard why people wear silver crosses around their neck?</p>
<p>The simple answer is also a simple question: how could he hear unless somebody told him?</p>
<p>Is there someone you know like this boy? Perhaps it's time for you to follow Jesus' example and befriend someone who doesn't know God. And, as a start, to let them know who the Christ of Christmas is and why there's a cross on churches all across Australia.</p>

<p>Jerusalem two thousand years ago was no stranger to infection. Leprosy was highly infectious. In order to prevent the disease spreading, the community created certain rules: lepers were ordered to wear a sign, ring a bell (like a cow - yeah, just a bit demeaning), keep their distance. This way, they thought, the threat of catching and passing on the illness could be contained.</p>
<p>Jerusalem two thousand years ago also knew the dangers of moral corruption. Or teachings from another faith. Or other people's worldviews. So they had other rules too. Avoid mixing with non-Jewish types. Don't eat with a tax collector. Don't trade ideas with a Roman. Avoid the sinner (like you would a leper). This way a good Jewish boy could remain a good Jewish boy.</p>
<p>And then Jesus came. He lunched with tax collectors. He hung about with prostitutes. He touched lepers. Actually touched them. He seemed to be a law unto himself. Jesus hung out with the outcasts. Instead of being infected himself, He cured others. He cured the forgotten with dignity and humanity. He cured those who'd lost hope with second chances. He cured sinful people with holiness. Who are the forgotten in your circles? Who are the urban lepers? Reach out today to someone and tell them of the cure that only Jesus can offer.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Exodus 17:10-13 NIV goes: 'So Joshua fought the Amalekites ... and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. When Moses' hands grew tired... Aaron and Hur held his hands up... So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army...'</p>
<p>This story is about intercessory prayer. What's an 'intercessor'? Job said, 'My intercessor is my friend... on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.' (Job 16:20-21 NIV) So, someone who prays to God for other people.</p>
<p>Who knows what went on at the top of that hill? Perhaps, as Moses prayed, God gave the Israelites battle strategies? Perhaps prayer caused confusion and disunity in the Amalekites' camp? Perhaps, the spiritual realms changed through prayer, allowing goodness to overcome evil? Ehh, truth is, we don't know exactly how prayer won out that day. We only know it did.</p>
<p>It is the same for you. God wants you to pray for others because it matters. God wants you to intercede because it will win. God wants you to pick up and put on His mind and perspective. Perhaps that's why Jesus told us to pray for our enemies. Prayer reveals to us what God believes for them. Prayer matters.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I will restore to you...' Joel 2:25 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever life has taken from you, God can restore. He may not give you exactly what you want, but He will give you what's best. And even when you fall under His corrective hand through disobedience, if you repent, He will reinstate you to a place of blessing. 'But what about the time I've wasted, the opportunities I've squandered, and the mess I've made of my life? Sometimes I wonder if I've fallen so low that even God cannot reach me.' No, there's hope for you. The Bible says, 'Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear.' (Isaiah 59:1 NKJV) After wasting all that he'd inherited from his father, the Prodigal Son returned home, penniless and embarrassed. All he wanted was three square meals and a job in the servants' quarters. But the moment he confessed his sin, his father called for the best robe, the fattest cow, the newest shoes, and a ring of sonship restoring him to his rightful place as a member of the family. Even under the crushing weight of the Old Testament Law, with demands that no one could live up to, God said, 'If a man steals an ox or a sheep...he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.' (Exodus 22:1 NKJV) Now if God would do that for those who lived under the Law, how much more will He do for those He has redeemed? So you can go to Him today with confidence, knowing He's a God of restoration.</p>

<p>Before David became king, he returned to his hometown one day to find it burned to the ground. The Amalekites had come raiding and kidnapped all the people as slaves. His men were stunned and, in their despair at losing their families and needing to find someone to blame, they talked about stoning David. David found a quiet place and poured his heart out to God. And then God answered: 'Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.' (1 Samuel 30:8 NKJ) The Lord was about to return what was taken and more. Are you ashamed of the years you've wasted? Talk to God about them. Ask Him what to do. Remember this: whatever you've lost in the past, God can restore it. He promised the nation of Israel: 'I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten... You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.' (Joel 2:25-26 NKJ) He wants to restore us as a people too. He promises to restore our souls and to prepare a table for us in the presence of our enemies. (Psalm 23) Ever since Adam and Eve 'blew it' in Eden, God's desire and plan has been to restore to us what we have lost - our right relationship with Him. So come to Him today and let the restoration begin.</p>

<p>The Bible has a running theme of ruin and restoration. Adam and Eve mess up - and the rest of the story is God restoring what was lost in Eden. The world grows into a cesspit of sin and flood waters destroy it; God restores the earth through Noah. Abraham is on track to be a forgotten name in pre-recorded history; God gives him a child and restores him as the father of nations. Joseph is trafficked into slavery; God elevates him to a place of governmental power and restores his family to him. The Israelites are strangers in a strange land; God leads them to a Promised Land and restores their inheritance. The Philistines tower over the Israelites; God restores the balance of power through David.</p>
<p>The Old Testament is jam-packed with stories of God's restoring hand. And then Jesus arrives. God's own Son is abandoned to a cross. Three days later a restoring power like none ever seen in history before or since is unleashed. Resurrection runs as a theme through the New Testament. The power of life over death is still refreshing and revitalising the world today. Whatever mess we find ourselves in, God's hand of restoration is reaching in. When situations look dead and buried, God's resurrection power speaks life. And life abundantly.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Your God will come with ... recompense [restoration].' Isaiah 35:4 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>'<i>Blessed are those who recognise they are spiritually helpless. The Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them</i>.' (Matthew 5:3 GWT) It may not feel like a blessing to be spiritually helpless, but God has an excellent track record of giving blessings in those times. With your best intentions exhausted, it's perfect for God's best intentions to come into the picture. When you've run out of your own strength, God can more easily point you to His. Are you all out of steam today? Read this: 'Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who are fearful-hearted, &quot;Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense [restoration]...He will come and save you.&quot;' (Isaiah 35:3-4 NKJ)If you've got little to show for your best efforts, God will elevate you at the right time. If everything has just come crashing to the ground, God will re-attach wings to your hopes and throw them back into flight. He will give birth to new hope. He says in 1 Peter 1:3 ESV, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.' Take heart: God is the God of restoration. The moment that you become empty of your own power, He'll remind you that His is much greater.</p>

<p><br />What's spiritual warfare then? *wheel out blackboard*</p>
<p>The things of this world around us are caused and affected by angels, demons and God's people, as part of a cosmic fight. It's big. It might sound... peculiar... but when we've accepted 'God' as one Spirit living in a realm beyond our sight, it follows that there may well be other spirits (small 's') to be aware of, in our real life...</p>
<p>So let's brush up on our battle plans: <em>Know your enemy</em>. It's not as simple as 'God vs devil'. 'The accuser' (which is what 'Satan' means in the original Hebrew) isn't God's equal. God created everything, including the devil (the story is that Satan was a good angel before he rebelled against God), and God has ultimate power over everything. God allows Satan to exist and to act (Job 1:12), for reasons that we can trust are best in the long run. However, if Satan tried to take on God directly, there'd be no contest (check Revelation 12:7-9). So, his 'indirect' attacks on God = attacks on His precious children. Yep, us. Satan's out to destroy the things of God, and His people too. But. Whilst it's true that this needs to be taken seriously - GOD IS STRONGER.</p>
<p>In war, clever lies are more valuable than face-to-face fights. Don't be surprised if, in your situation, it seems like Satan's far more powerful. It's not true: it's a powerful lie of his strategy. The oldest known Christian creed is simply: '<em>Jesus is Lo</em><em>rd</em>'. In every place of fear or despair you find yourself in, remind yourself of that truth over and over, speak it out into the darkness. In our struggle against spiritual forces, we need to increase our faith.</p>

<p>Right, enemy identified. Now there's good news coming...</p>
<p>(1) <em>Know the battlefield</em>. It's you. God loves you, and wants you to know it. Satan wants to separate you from Him. The battle is over you. Your actions (which Satan can use to claim you) are based in your words, your words in your thoughts. This is one reason why praising God is so powerful: you're focusing on Him in your mind AND you're welcoming Him into your mind. That's an impenetrable cloud of beauty, that you were made for, and Satan can't get near.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Know your protection</em>. The biggest and best protection you have is, simply, JESUS. When you've said 'yes' to Jesus, He's set you free from any claim by Satan that you sinned and now he owns you! You're not in his power.</p>
<p>You're not in his kingdom. You're in Christ, with all the freedom, the love, the peace of mind and the deepest joy that the 'armour of God' provides. This isn't a blueprint for you to charge into Satan's kingdom, SAS style, and rescue hostages. Except... Remember how the battlefield is you? By getting your relationship with God sorted, choosing against sin, and by wanting to see other people come to know that Jesus is for them (Romans 8:31), you're storming the most important of enemy-held territory. Ephesians 6:12-18 is a famous passage on the armour Jesus has provided for you. As you read about it, pray to re-position yourself into that armour every day this week.</p>

<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Sometimes, bad things happen and, despite how it looks, you're not actually under attack. You may be working through the consequences of some sinful mess you've made. (That happens. It doesn't mean God hasn't forgiven you. Forgiveness and consequences aren't the same thing. Dad might forgive you for crashing his car but it still has to get fixed.) God has a great plan for you. It may be He wants to build your strength in Him, or increase 'discipline' in you, to grow you, '...so that the proven genuineness of your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire - may result in praise, glory and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed.' (1 Peter 1:6-7 NIV)</p>
<p>So: (1) <em>Be very careful what you blame on Satan!</em> It could be the case that God is growing you. How to tell? Pray. Ask God for His protection. Turn away from anything that could give Satan a claim over you (in other words: 'repenting'). Declare, and act, that Jesus is Lord over your life. It doesn't matter what the cause of 'bad things happening' is, submitting yourself to Jesus is the way to win.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Discip</em><em>line is an aspect of </em><em>'</em><em>Spiritual Warfare</em><em>'.</em> If you're living for God, keeping yourself from temptation, stepping out with Jesus when He prompts you to and lining up your priorities with His, then you're getting yourself further into His protection! And at the same time, you're arming yourself with the tools to help set other captives free! Like the army trains its soldiers, don't underestimate the warfare value of discipline.</p>

<p>TV drip-feeds all sorts of things into your brain. Like ads. They're there to convince you your life could be better if only you had [<em>insert name of sweet new product here</em>]. Before long, you'll find yourself thoroughly discontented, forgetting the truth of Philippians 4:19 that, <em>'</em><em>God will provide all [your] needs</em>.'</p>
<p>Or like sexy, sexy... sex. TV turns bodies into a spectacle all the time. Even in camera angles and scenes that linger on the desirability of other people, they're telling you how to focus your gaze. Don't be surprised if you find it much harder to, '<em>Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honourable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable</em>.' (Philippians 4:8 NLT) When we stop enjoying the goodness of life as God intended and instead see only products or bodies, our life shrinks.</p>
<p>Success lies in daily routine. So, get to know God better through His Word and prayer. Make up your mind to be of service to somebody every day. Tackle a problem bigger than you. Encourage everyone you meet. Take the first step toward overcoming a bad habit. Do something for somebody who can't repay you. Be thankful for what you have. Ask for help when you need it. Give God the best of your day. And, one day, if you do not give up, you will harvest a multiplied blessing of what you have planted.</p>

<p>Strap yourselves in. This might be a rough one.</p>
<p>Having the 'best of both worlds' sounds like a great life policy, but it depends on the 'worlds' we're talking about. God's really clear on certain 'worlds' not mixing: '...you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons.' (1 Corinthians 10:21 NIV) The thing is, our God is a jealous God. Not 'jealous' in the way that means God thinks, 'Ohh, I wish I had Mr. Smith's car,' but 'jealous' in the sense He doesn't want us flirting with evil - He wants us to devote ourselves totally to good and to Him. He deserves nothing less. And note, He wants it, at least in part, because He also knows that's the best possible situation for us. If we give space in our hearts to His enemy (the very force that's our real enemy too), He becomes jealous for that piece of our heart that should be His - for His glory, and for our protection...</p>
<p>Every time we give our best to something that is not of Him, we compromise - we compromise our love, compromise our holiness, and compromise our relationship with Him. And why should He stand for that? For God, compromising His love for us is not an option. He would never go there. The least we owe Him is our commitment to live our lives for Him, and only Him.</p>
<p>So this means that, if there's a certain sin that you know you need to leave behind, do it. Today. Each time it rears its head pray out loud: 'God, I choose You and Your ways.'</p>

<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>'I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.' (Proverbs 4:11 NIV) Does the straight path mentioned here feel more like a straitjacket to you? The world jangles and hypnotises us with a bunch of keys that God doesn't want us to grab. And that's what the straight path is - avoiding the shiny, empty things of this world.</p>
<p>God wants us to walk that path because it's the way leading to a full life in Him. Living for the sparkly things of the world will damage your soul and rob you of that full life. And as Matthew 16:26 NLT says: 'What do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?'</p>
<p>It's a 'you're either with me or against me' deal with God. That's not because He's a cling-on - it's because what this world offers is a cling-on. And He's come to save us from it. The rich and famous don't have the answer. The people who say, 'Anything goes as long as it makes me happy' don't have the answer, either. Only God can satisfy your soul.</p>
<p>If you can get a clear sense in God of where you are, what you know, and what you want, you're well on your way to understanding and embracing the thing He put you on earth to do. Moses spent the first two-thirds of his life working out what God wanted him to do, trying to do things his own way, only to fail. But he had a heart for God, and a vision from God, and eventually he succeeded. So can you, if you keep on that straight path.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'But if you remain in Me and My words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted.' John 15:7 NLT<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Amazing, eh! <em>...ask </em><em>for anything you want, and it will be granted...</em> It makes God sound like a genie who will grant every wish. However let's not forget the key words that begin this verse: <em>...if you remain in Me...</em></p>
<p>That's a big condition. And there's more: <em>...if My words rem</em><em>ain in you...</em></p>
<p>The fact is, if you remain in God, your desires and prayers will become increasingly geared towards wanting more of His good, flourishing growth in your life and in the lives of those around you. God promises to provide all our needs; so, if you really do need something, believe God will provide. That's not as nice as it might sound. Think about it. If you really really need something, God will provide it. If you really need that top-of-the-range fresh-out pro-computer, God will make sure you receive it. But if you don't, if all you really need is a pen and paper, that may just be what you get.</p>
<p>You've got to live knowing that whatever you get from God is the best for you at that time. Learn to rejoice in being given (only) what you need. His hand will reach to you, and sort out your provisions. But always seek to look for His face first, and His hand second.</p>
<p>So, now's the moment for a tough question: what do you want most in your life right now? Out with it. Now: does that line up with what you've read today? And, if not, what are you going to do about it?</p>

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Very often if you're force-fed certain food growing up (broccoli, for instance), you will always have a gag reflex to that particular food (it's broccoli, isn't it?) If people just experience judgment from Christians and feel Bible-bashed in every conversation, it's hardly likely to make them want to 'taste and see that the Lord is good.' (Good, as in probably unlike broccoli). They'll avoid you like you're the plague (or even broccoli... ok, we'll stop going on about it now).</p>
<p>Too often we make the mistake of presenting the Gospel without the love of God. The Bible's clear we should take the message to the world, but we're called to do that as real people, not as pop-up Christians. One really good way of pairing love and the Gospel is in your relationships. That provides a ready-primed basis of love for the seeds of salvation to grow in. We're called to love others. If God's in the life and love we share, we can't help but share Him too. That way it's all natural. When we're led by the Holy Spirit and we ask Him for opportunities to speak about God, everyday conversations are opened up to bigger opportunities than we can imagine.</p>
<p>However sometimes we're called to share God's Gospel in a louder, bolder, non-relationship based way. If you're feeling that, pray, check with Scripture, make sure it's love-based and do it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Be patient in trouble, and prayerful always.' Romans 12:12 TLB<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been said that all of human life is in the Psalms. Every emotion, every need that can be brought before God, every cry from the heart. Every kind of prayer that every human being could ever want to pray is here. They provide us with a means for being honest before God about whatever we're feeling. One of the most common prayers in the Psalms is an impatient question: 'How long, O Lord?'</p>
<p>We all go through difficult times. Genuinely difficult times bring out genuinely difficult emotions. If a member of your family were seriously ill and you tried walking around with a fixed grin on your face, you'd be lying to yourself and hurting your family too - dealing with hard stuff doesn't mean we need to put on a tough exterior of 'everything's ok.' Not at all. It's important not to hide our emotions but ask God to help us handle them. The Psalms are our fall-back, our guide to the 'how' of expressing them. But more than this, the Psalms give us hope. Hope that someone else has been here before - and came out the other side. Hope that God is listening, and is big enough to take the worst you've got to throw at Him. Prayer turns negative energy into a powerful force for good.</p>
<p>When you're faced with a difficult problem, appreciate the chance to learn. Solomon said, '...the diligent make use of everything...' (Proverbs 12:27 NLT) Learn from your experience regardless of how hard it is, and remember, some of the world's greatest discoveries and breakthroughs resulted from a crisis.</p>

<p>Sometimes we like to imagine we're superheroes. We picture ourselves charging in on a white horse to save our friends/city/world, while we fly God's banner and throw lavish gifts to the poor. We all want to hear from God, but when we don't, the temptation can be to run off on our own terms.</p>
<p>When we feel like God has put us on hold, then the key is patience in prayer plus persistence in reading through his Word. These keys unlock the door to where we should all want to be: closer to Him. With visions or dreams, or even our own discipleship-process, we can be lured into gazing into ourselves. Instead of focusing on God, we can enjoy our own life's narrative and our epic plans. We can be tempted into thinking what heroes we are as we watch our character traits unfold like the facets of a jewel.</p>
<p>When God takes His place at the centre of our lives, as the Highest King and the only jewel worth gazing at, everything falls into place healthily - we know we're not the Saviour, we're just blessed being helpers and privileged to be guides for those around us.</p>
<p>Being enthusiastic isn't an issue, neither are our own ideas. The problem comes when we stop being sacrificial, stop being God-centred as well as others-centred and instead start making our own vision, dream or entrepreneurial spirit the centre of our lives.</p>

<p><br />When it comes to prayer, God isn't moved by the quality or the quantity of your words. He's moved by a heart that spills the burdens of the day across the altar, exposing every worry to His power. Your confidence in prayer is not based on your 'can' - on your ability to speak, for instance, but rather on God's 'can' - His ability to hear and understand. He knows what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>The old hymn goes: '<em>In seasons of d</em><em>istress and grief, my soul has often found relief. And oft escaped the tempter</em><em>'</em><em>s snare, by thy return, sweet hour of prayer</em>.' If you want that sort of comfort and control over yourself, give your 'distress and grief' up to God. Because whatever you give to God, He handles. What you keep, you burn yourself out trying to handle.</p>
<p>Prayer gives you back the strength, energy to cope and right focus that everyday life takes away. When you pray, you're saying, 'Lord, I believe You're more competent to deal with this than I am, and I trust You to do it.' God will intervene on your behalf, just stay committed to Him. '<em>Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.</em><em>'</em> (Psalm 37:5 NKJ)</p>
<p>Today step outside of routine, of the unhelpful bits of 'religion' that hold you back from naturally spending time with God. 'Pray as you can, not as you can't.'</p>

<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p><br />Today's verse makes it sound like God is hemming us in, locking us off, sealing us tight away from the world. One of the more literal Bible versions even says that God is 'besieging' us!</p>
<p>Can that be right? <em>Hmm</em><em>m... yes</em>. That is just what He's doing. There are two parts to this verse, and it's best really to hear them both as one. When we make a commitment not to sin, when we repent and say, 'God, I reject evil and choose your path,' we begin an agreement with Him. For the rest of our lives (for better or worse, richer or poorer, and so on...) His part of the agreement is to help us fight off sin and lift us up to live a better life. He's going to help us bat away wrong thoughts. He's going to give us a way of escape when temptation hits (so there's no excuse ever for saying, 'I couldn't help myself.') He's going to put safeguards around us.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean it's going to be a cruise. It's going to be tough sometimes. If we start down a route with dodgy thoughts or actions that He won't like - too right He's going to put up fences to shut us off. It is never to oppress us or abuse us - only ever for our good and for our proper freedom. Of course we can still ignore the fences but, if we're wise, we'll thank Him for them.</p>
<p>The Hand that holds you up is the same Hand that keeps you out of destruction's path - be careful when you teeter on its edge and don't ignore the prompt to head away from danger.</p>

<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>God doesn't lie to us. God doesn't pretend that we're never going to have trouble in our life. In fact He even uses the word '<i>when</i>', not '<i>if</i>': 'When a storm strikes...' (Proverbs 10:25), 'When you meet trials of various kinds...' (James 1:2 ESV), 'When we run into problems and trials...' (Romans 5:3 NLT)</p>
<p>That might not sound like much comfort to you.</p>
<p>But coming right up behind it is some good news. God doesn't lie about Himself either. 'The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.' (Proverbs 18:10 NIV) God's 'name' speaks of His character, His reliability and His faithfulness. People without God are forced to be their own god (and that's a pretty terrifying thought, on many levels), relying on their own strength and wingspan to get them through life's turbulence. Those who love God can say, 'God is...always ready to help in times of trouble. And so, we won't be afraid! Let the earth tremble and the mountains tumble into the deepest sea. Let the ocean roar and...its raging waves shake the mountains.' (Psalm 46:1-3 CEV)</p>
<p>If God won't lie about who He is (a safe place to hide), then He definitely isn't going to hold back who He is (YOUR safe place to hide) when you need Him.</p>

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Christianity isn't just for sunny days. In fact, your faith shines all the brighter in the middle of a storm. God is like a rock-hard barrier; He's tougher than the storms that surround you. God's Word tells us in Psalm 18:2 ESV,<em> </em><em>'</em><em>The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer... in whom I take refug</em><em>e...</em><em>'</em><em> </em>So trust in God and His Word and you'll be able to out-weather the nastiest downpour.</p>
<p>Look at Job. He went through the wildest storms, and his only conversation with God kept him standing. He said: <em>'</em><em>...I have treasured the words of His mouth more t</em><em>han my necessary food</em><em>'</em><em> </em> (Job 23:12 NKJ), which quite conveniently brings us onto the topic of fasting.</p>
<p>Food-fasting is a biggie of an issue, and we're not going there today. However, fasting means much more than the odd dinnerless day. The history of the word shows that it really comes from 'to hold yourself in firm control', 'to hold fast' - an ability that we can gain by fasting from habits and activities just as much from fasting from food.</p>
<p>Scrolling down our newsfeeds whilst instagramming our breakfast can become just as 'necessary' to our lives as eating that breakfast (bringing to mind the age-old question: if you didn't Instagram it, did you really eat it?)</p>
<p>Challenge: wouldn't that Facebooking-Tweeting-Instagramming-time be better spent checking-in with God and building self-discipline? Here's a fast of a different kind: Log out of all your social media accounts. Stay logged out for a day, a week, or even a month. Whenever you crave logging back in, use the time to pray. A social media fast may be just the thing to storm-proof yourself in prayer.</p>

<p><br />No matter how bad we feel, God is the great redeemer. Being overly self-focused on our mistakes can be our greatest weakness; a flaw in our make-up that sends us tripping up over our every self-doubt.</p>
<p>Maybe you've felt it on your worst days: a string of nervy thoughts that keep you looking inward. 'Oh, what have I done wrong now...?'</p>
<p>But the court's adjourned, God's judgment has come in. Paul the apostle wrote: <i>'</i><i>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. My conscience is clear, but that </i><i>does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.</i><i>'</i> (1 Corinthians 4: 3-4 NIV)</p>
<p>In Jesus we are seen as though we have His total spotlessness, God's judgment on us is, 'These are all good. I've got them. I'm for them.'</p>
<p>Paul knew it, so he didn't even judge himself when he messed up.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean ignoring our problems, or that there won't be consequences if we're constantly acting out a sin we know we shouldn't. But when we make mistakes and start a little internal storm, feel deserted by others or judged by them, we can say with Paul that <i>'</i><i>... the Lord stood with me and gave me strength ... All glory to God forever and ever!</i><i>'</i><i> </i>(2 Timothy 4:18 NLT)</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody likes to feel burdened by others, but check this out - God actually wants to be burdened by you. <em>'</em><em>Give your burdens to the Lord, and He will take care of you. He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.</em><em>'</em><em> </em>(Psalm 55:22 NLT) We need to use one of our biggest assets: worship. Whatever the situation, make the stone-cold rock-hard choice to rejoice and be glad. Choose to worship God, who has given you the ultimate Guide (to life, the universe and everything) that will help you through your day. <em>'</em><em>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.</em><em>'</em> (Philippians 4:6 NIV)</p>
<p>Practical tip: Music as a form of worship can really help with squashing worry (BTW: Did you know there's far more to worship music than secular music... but let's discuss that another day...) One of the best ways to get to know another country's language is to learn songs in that language (think primary school Italian or Mandarin.) It's the same with learning not to worry. If you fill your head with songs that focus on Godly values, you'll learn His language of comfort and freedom. Not in a metaphorical way, but in a literal mind-renewing kind of way. It's worth having a favourite worship song on standby in your brain, for every time you start to feel majorly anxious. Even repeating it silently to yourself in your mind can help to bring calm.</p>

<p>'<em>Mountaintop moments</em>.'</p>
<p>Perhaps you've heard the phrase? Maybe you've even experienced them yourself - those epiphany moments when everything makes sense; when God feels close and your destiny seems clear. The Bible gives us plenty of evidence that God does spectacular things for His people on mountaintops. On Mount Moriah, He met with Abraham and Isaac. On Mount Horeb, He spoke to Moses through a burning bush. On Mount Sinai, He gave the Ten Commandments. On Mount Carmel, He sent down fire from heaven.</p>
<p>But after one such mountaintop experience, Moses showed the people that God isn't only to be found when you're feeling 'on top of the world'. Addressing the nation of Israel for the last time, Moses told them, 'There is no one like the God of Israel. He rides across the Heavens to help you... The eternal God is your refuge, and His everlasting arms are under you...' (Deuteronomy 33:26-27 NLT)</p>
<p>God's presence is always there for you when you look down. No matter how steep the valley you have to walk, no matter how sharp the descent, God's presence is deeper. Underneath you are His everlasting arms. The truth is: He's not just Lord at the top, He's also Lord at the bottom.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...As we have opportunity, let us do good to all...' Galatians 6:10 NIV<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p><br />'Do not forget to do good and to share...' (Hebrews 13:16 NLT) So what does 'doing good' mean, in these verses? A little giving to charity or a bit of schoolyard-style swap: 'You can have a piece of my chewing gum because you gave me a crisp yesterday'? There's that. Those things are ok, but not as the upper limits of what it means to 'do good to all.' It's easy giving when people give to you and taking when other people take. Then there's the life of Jesus - what we're called to be like. We must, often, choose between the world's 'good' and God's good (this choice happens everyday, not just in Sunday school lessons...) Francis of Assisi summed up what he thought living out God's 'good' looked like, in this prayer:</p>
<p><em>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,</em></p>
<p><em>Where there is hatred, let me sow love;</em></p>
<p><em>Where there is injury, pardon;</em></p>
<p><em>Where there is doubt, faith;</em></p>
<p><em>Where there is despair, hope;</em></p>
<p><em>Where there is darkness, light;</em></p>
<p><em>Where there is sadness, joy.</em></p>
<p>It's different. It's difficult. But with God's life in you, you start to realise, and let out, your natural compassionate side. Living it out is when you are most truly yourself.</p>

<p><br /><i>Not ashamed</i>. As a follower of Christ, that should be your testimony. Because you have placed your trust in Him you are able to say, 'I am not ashamed' of:</p>
<p>(1) <i>His birth</i>. Mary was His mother, but God was His Father. So He had no inherited sin or practised sin, so He met all of God's requirements to be our Saviour.</p>
<p>(2) <i>His miracles</i>. He never demanded money in exchange for a miracle. Not one supernatural act was performed for selfish or showy purposes, but only to meet people's needs.</p>
<p>(3) <i>His preaching</i>. Even His enemies had to admit, '...No man ever spoke like this Man!' (John 7:46 NKJ) His words transform us.</p>
<p>(4) <i>His claims</i>. He said, '...He who has seen Me has seen the Father...' (John 14:9 NKJ) You see who God is by looking at Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>(5) <i>His death</i>. He bore your shame. You were morally and spiritually bankrupt. But He satisfied all of God's claims against you at the cross, writing 'Paid in full' across your account.</p>
<p>(6) <i>His resurrection</i>. His promise is, '...Because I live, you will live also.' (John 14:19 NKJ)</p>
<p>(7) <i>His mediator</i><i>-</i><i>ship</i>. Picture this: when you fail, He stands before God on your behalf, offering His blood as atonement for your sin. If you saw Him now would you say, 'I am not ashamed of Jesus'?</p>

<p><br /><i>Not ashamed</i>. 'I am not ashamed of the Gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes...' (Romans 1:16 NKJ) Huge, right? Paul had a massive reputation for being a religious fanatic. But, you know what, he didn't let that stop him being true to what he believed. More than that, it didn't stop him stamping his foot and shouting out loud, 'I am not ashamed.'</p>
<p>He stuck with his faith in God, and his calling to share the Gospel, without even slightly diminishing in his enthusiasm. If anything, the insults made that fire burn brighter.</p>
<p>And that's a good lesson to learn. No matter how you share your faith, you'll probably come up against someone who calls you a fanatic at some point. The only thing to do in that situation is to own it. Step up and say, 'Yeah, I'm a Christian. And &quot;I am not ashamed&quot; of it.'</p>
<p>Also, take a sec to think about the last bit of that verse. 'The Gospel... is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.' Well, that's too massive a thing to allow your own shyness to get in the way.</p>
<p>There is no room to be ashamed when people's very souls are on the line. Shout out for the sake of the Kingdom.</p>

<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your big hope for the future? Do you hope to be famous one day? Or rich?</p>
<p>Jim Carrey said, 'I wish that everybody could get rich and famous and everything they ever dreamed of - so that they could see that's not the answer.' And he's one of Hollywood's richest and most famous actors! Fame is a hope that will ultimately disappoint. Wealth will disappoint too.</p>
<p>As Christians, our 'big hope' is this: 'Your Kingdom come' (Matthew 6:10) - a Kingdom where people are loved just as they are; a Kingdom where the cleaner is as honoured as the movie star; a Kingdom where the young aren't patronised and the old aren't ignored; where the grieving are comforted; where the lonely are befriended; a Kingdom where the thief and the victim are restored by justice.</p>
<p>God promises us that the 'big hope' of seeing that 'Kingdom come' is one that we can count on. And that, friends of <em>word4U2day</em>, is why we don't need to be ashamed. Our hope is absolutely assured. It's shout-it-out-without-fear-of-ever-being-wrong guaranteed. So step up and claim it.</p>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Feeling lost isn’t new to the society we’re in. It’s the result of ‘doing our own thing’, which human beings have done at every point in history. Giving in to temptation ends up leaving you dejected and fed up. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>But: everyone gets tempted. Others have resisted; and so can you. God, your God, will show you a way out.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Great</span></em><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>! But what does that help look like? The first practical tip is recognising which people and situations can cause you to fail badly. Be honest. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Secondly, get–outta–there. Turn over the channel and choose not to give in to your feelings. Make a phone call. Get accountable. Pray. Whatever you do, don’t just sit there and attempt to fight it with your own willpower. Maybe turning to someone outside of yourself feels the same as giving up. But the first thing Christianity teaches us that every one of us, on our own, will fail when left to our own devices. It’s totally valid—and a much better option—to look outside yourself and turn to God, even when all you feel is the desire to sin. Look to God, because He’s bigger than our own drive to do wrong. Turn to friends who you trust and who love you and will stand with you.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>And, when you see one of these exit routes, take it. Ways out can be here one second and gone the next. Don’t miss out on stepping out of temptation, and into God’s better life. Telling another person you’re struggling with something can be hard, but worth its weight in gold (Check out James 5:16!) Pray for courage, and then make the move to connect.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 25-27, Matt 25:14-23, Ps 31, Pro 8:34-36<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59292&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Not by a hidden camera at the bottom of your street ... but by other people. And especially by God, ‘For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth...’ (2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Footballers, celebrities and sadly even politicians provide society with shaky role models. Even though they’re shot into the limelight, it doesn’t take much scratching to discover all sorts of not–so–glamorous history lurking beneath the surface. When things are falling apart, it’s the church’s chance to offer an alternative. So the question you need to ask is—‘what are you modelling’?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>There are heaps of ways to bless people around you. Are your friends going through a tough patch? Take them out for a coffee and encourage them. Are your mates counting every cent? Give them a generous treat. Has your church leader asked you to serve tea and coffee? Go the extra mile: clean the kitchen while you’re at it. Darkness might be all around but your good deeds can penetrate any gloom. A little love goes a long way, ‘For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who His children really are.’ (Romans 8:19 NLT)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>So if your light is fading away tonight, it’s time to ask Jesus to help you discover how to let it shine more brightly for Him.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 28-30, Matt 25:24-30, Ps 72:1-11, Pro 9:1-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59296&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You've been given... the privilege of suffering for Him.' Philippians 1:29 NLT<br /><br /><p>It may not be the kind of message that will see your non–church mates sprinting into a Sunday service, but Jesus never hid uncomfortable truth. ‘Taking up your cross’ wasn’t just poetic language. It meant something very visible for the people of the early church, and they knew it wasn’t nice.</p>
<p>It was this kind of preaching that made the disciples question Jesus’ choice of message, but He didn’t shy away from it. The Bible seems to ask the impossible when it tells us to think of times of suffering as opportunities for punching the air in joy. It seems to have a different outcome in mind to the rest of us; ‘When your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow… When your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.’ (James 1:3 NLT) We want to be happy. But God wants us to see things from His point of view, leading to holiness. Then, our happiness isn’t based on shaky foundations.</p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>As Dr Robert Pickles said: ‘Joy depends on Jesus, happiness depends on happenings.’ </span></p>
<p>The secret? He saw things from God’s point of view, not his own. He had God’s perspective, right priorities and knew the best source of Power.<strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> </em></strong>How’re you doing today? Take a look at whether you’re chasing ‘happiness’ or ‘joy’. Is contentment in your life dependent on happiness or Jesus?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 31-32, Matt 25:31-46, Ps 72:12-20, Pro 9:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59297&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Moses said to the Lord...' Exodus 33:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Sound is important to our daily lives. But noise isn’t. Noise is classically defined as ‘unwanted sound’, and it’s a bigger problem today than ever before. How do we filter out the unwanted and keep the wanted? Maybe it’s the same with our Christian faith. Never before have we had as many resources, sermons, podcasts, e–books etc. How do we decide which to listen to or read? Even <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>word4U2day</em> is a daily choice in all these resources.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>But does this make it easier? Not necessarily. With all this noise, God’s voice can be even harder to hear. Track back to Paul’s day and there was a similar problem: ‘Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the Gospel.’ (1 Corinthians 4:15 NIV) There were lots of people with helpful advice, but few people to be a ‘spiritual father’ (the type of really wise, holy individual who’d devote themselves to your growth). Track back another couple of thousand years and even Job had his own form of noise pollution: the world–famous ‘Job’s comforters’. It seemed like they were saying the right thing—after all, they loved Job. But in the end, they turned out to be just a bunch of nosey, noisy neighbours.</span></p>
<p>Learning to hear God’s voice above all the others is vital. It takes dedication and practice to listen for Him, but (obviously), it’s the most worthwhile Voice you’ll ever hear.<strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;> </strong>So if you<strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;> </strong>feel you’re in a one–sided relationship, where God never speaks to you, talk to a Christian you reckon can help and ask how you can change that. It’s so worth it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 33:1-36:26, Matt 26:1-13, Ps 32, Pro 9:10-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59298&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' John 16:33 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The Bible is surprisingly full of people having really tough times. It seems that after thousands of years of getting to know God, mankind still hasn’t been able to get its collective head around our good, loving God allowing us to face ‘times of trial’. It’s a tough question in theory, but it’s much harder again when you’re living the tough times in reality. Bad things happening in life is a sad reality of living in a fallen world.</p>
<p>Not–so–‘news’–flash: following Jesus is not a ticket for a life free from pain. Jesus wasn’t lying when He said, ‘Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows.’ (John 16:33 NLT) But He doesn’t stop there. He goes on to say, ‘But take heart, because I have overcome the world.’ This is the good news in a nutshell. Not only did God so love the world that He gave us Jesus, but we can overcome trials and sorrows with Him. It’s all to do with how you respond. Apparently, if you break a bone in your leg, the bone will actually heal stronger than it ever was originally; the break will heal, then another layer of bone will grow over the area, reinforcing it. That’s cool. For our hearts, being broken could be the start of finding your strength in God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:22, 2 Pet 3:3-15, Matt 5:39, 1 Sam 25:1-42 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59300&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... God intended it all for good...' Genesis 50:20 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Sometimes bad things happen even to those we’d call ‘good people’. Knowing a Sovereign God who could command a whole legion of angels to meet your every whim, but for some reason doesn’t, might be frustrating at times. So why doesn’t God sort out all our problems? It’s not that God isn’t bothered by your pain. A big part of the reason is that God wants to bring us closer to Himself. He wants us to have good qualities that reflect Him; He wants character, perseverance and hope.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Instead of gift–wrapping those qualities and handing them to us on a plate, He puts us in situations where we have to develop them. Those situations are not usually ‘fun’. God’s using your exact situation to discipline you: to <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>disciple </em>you. ‘No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening—it’s painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.’ (Hebrews 12:11 NLT)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>When you pray for blessings, you might be thinking of achievements, money, or that special someone stepping right into your life. But there’s more to be gained in this life than those things: God sees the bigger picture of your character development. The Beatitudes in Matthew 5 give an alternative definition of ‘blessed’. Special mentions go to the poor in spirit and the persecuted. When we do eventually leave this life, and meet God face to face, what will we actually get to take with us? </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 36:27-40:16, Matt 26:14-25, Ps 25:1-7, Pro 9:17-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59301&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My grace is sufficient for you...' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The story of Joseph (you know, the guy with the rainbow–coloured dreamcoat) is a classic. But what makes the story worthy of being made into a musical production that played on New York’s Broadway and London’s West End theatres? Maybe it’s because the hero doesn’t sail into his destiny without a bumpy ride along the way. Kidnapping, enforced slavery, false accusations and prison all spring up as road–blocks in the life of the man who had been promised greatness. Circumstances went from bad to worse, then to worse still, as he rode his personal ancient–Egyptian rollercoaster. But there was one key recurring truth: ‘The Lord was with Joseph.’ (Genesis 39:2 NIV)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Joseph might have wanted things simple and easy. He might have revelled in watching his brothers bow down to him in awe—without any of the hard stuff on the way. But God had a bigger plan for him, one that focused on Joseph becoming the man God wanted him to be: someone capable of leading a nation. He wouldn’t have been that way without the challenges. He also wouldn’t have had the opportunity to experience God’s presence along the way. Over the thirteen years of suffering, God was growing Joseph. He was teaching Him a spiritual paradox that says it’s when you’re weak that you can fully allow God to be God. As God said to Paul, ‘My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT)<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>So don’t pray for tasks that match your gifting, but for gifting that will match your tasks.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 41-44, Matt 26:26-46, Ps 25:8-15, Pro 10:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59302&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They nominated... Barsabbas...and Matthias.' Acts 1:23 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The early Church was full on, packed with faithful disciples, ready to lay down their lives for God! They were totally in tune with God, right? Right! (Well, one or two exceptions—but even they were examples for the rest.)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>But yet, despite being ‘in tune’ with Him, God was unpredictable. His Holy Spirit ‘blows wherever it pleases’ (John 3:8). Which means even your pastor or minister or chaplain hasn’t got Him figured out! You see, sometimes, we might go the way <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>we</em> think right, but God will steer us somewhere else.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Case study</span></em><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>. The disciples weren’t sure what to do. Judas was gone; the team of apostles was a man short. A quick replacement was in order, so ‘Barsabbas and Matthias’ were nominated (two leadership hotshots). To decide who’d get the role, they use an ancient method of voting. As a result, Matthias got chosen. Who was he? Um, no idea (he’s never mentioned again)! But Barsabbas, the man who didn’t win the vote, went on to be a pioneer in teaching.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Did the disciples get it wrong? Was Matthias the right man for the job? Whether they got it right or wrong actually isn’t so important. Matthias might have gone on to do great, unrecorded, things. What matters is the fact they were seeking Him, and God honours that. Are you after God? Whether or not you hear His voice or feel His nudge, you’ll still see His Lordship. So write down three things you’d like God to change in you. Pray about them, and look back in a couple of months to see how He’s answered! (It might not be the way you expected, but that doesn’t matter!) </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 45-48, Matt 26:47-56, Ps 25:16-22, Pro 10:4-7<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59303&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the poor in spirit...' Matthew 5:3 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Ok, sometimes our relationships aren’t perfect. We’re definitely not just talking about that guy/girl you like, your parents, or your friends or class/work–mates. We’re talking about<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> anyone </em>who has an influence in your life. What can we do to build good relationships: how can we be totally sure others can confidently build trust and ‘Do Life’ with us?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>A clash of personalities or testing circumstances can seem to put real strain on relationships. Although we’re talking about a broad range of people you know today, we think Jesus covered a lot of ground with the ‘Beatitudes’. If you aren’t familiar with them, have a read of Matthew 5. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>How about four key points to blessed relationships? (1)<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> Be humble</em>. Self–promoting and always demanding <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>your </em>rights brings misery, while humility, self–denial and considering others’ needs bring happiness. (2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Be meek (restraining your power).</em> Maybe even hold back those harsh words that contain a bit of truth? (3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Be merciful.</em> You know when you’ve been hurt and left out? Don’t seek revenge from that. Instead, contribute to an atmosphere of forgiveness. (4) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Be a peacemaker.</em> During the week, if your brilliantly–genius ideas get ignored, don’t sweat. The ability to let go of our pride and not ‘win’ approval decreases the chance of conflict. Jesus was pretty good at that sort of stuff, being God and all. There’s definitely some stuff we can apply here to make the most of our time with others. Is there something you need to let go of in a relationship? Holding grudges is a killer—face up to the challenge of making peace today.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 49-50, Matt 26:57-68, Ps 50:1-15, Pro 10:8-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59304&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will see God.' Job 19:26 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Death is a fact of life. Your attitude towards it, however, is where your Christian faith could come into its own. When you fully understand that this life is not all there is, you’re free from the fear of whether or not there’s an ‘afterlife’. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Peter describes the Christians he’s writing to as ‘temporary residents and foreigners.’ (1 Peter 2:11 NLT) He was reminding them that they didn’t really belong to this world anyway. Their real home was with God. No matter what it says on your passport, your true citizenship is Heaven. That means our loyalty should be to God’s truth, His way of life and to His people. That should put your hissy fit about not being able to watch the TV programme you want into perspective. When you put ‘set apart–ness’ (or ‘consecration’) into practice, you probably will feel like an alien in a foreign land. ‘Not fitting in’ is par for the course if you want to be a true disciple.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>But death isn’t the end of the matter. Christ offers us eternal never–ending life. ‘Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death where is your sting?’ (1 Corinthians 15:54–55 NLT) Jesus won the biggest battle ever waged because He took your place for you to win eternal life for you. That’s worth living, and dying, for. Check out the whole of 1 Corinthians 15 to get a fuller idea of what the Bible says about death and resurrection. Be encouraged!</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Joel 1-3, Matt 27:1-10, Ps 56, Pro 10:14-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59306&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>We all want to be a good witness. Or at least, we <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>should</em> want to be. You’ll probably have opportunities to share your faith with people at school or uni or work or anywhere else you find yourself. But what better way to shine than by the example you set? Aiming to be the best for others speaks a thousand words. It shows your faith has meaning and that you’ve got deep roots.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Daniel was the kind of person who had made up his mind not to conform to the pattern of the world around him, but to be changed by the renewing of his mind to discern God’s will for him (check out Romans 12:2). God favoured him, and was working on his behalf, but Daniel had to play his part too.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>In a strange new place, he worked hard to adapt to a new culture. Culture alone wasn’t the enemy; his first battleground was compromise. He didn’t use his God–given commission as an excuse to not put any work in. He was polite, determined and steadfast in doing right. Daniel knew who he was, because he understood <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Whose</em> he was. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>More tests came along Daniel’s path (including his friends being thrown into a fiery furnace and some hungry lions), but his faithfulness in the small decisions prepared him for the life–changing stories that we read about today. Hard work is worth it. Give some thought to this question: has there been any unhealthy compromise in your life recently?

<introtext><![CDATA['We love because He first loved us.' 1 John 4:19 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Richard Wurmbrand was kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured for 14 years under Communist Romanian rule. He tells a story about the torture of a fellow Christian: ‘A minister I had heard of in Romania had been horribly beaten and was thrown back into the cell with the other prisoners. He was half–dead, with blood streaming from his face and body. As some of the prisoners washed him, others cursed the communists. Groaning, the minister said, “Please, don’t curse them! Keep silent! I wish to pray for them.”‘</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Those who tortured the minister had not asked for forgiveness. Nor had they shown remorse. And they would continue to beat him the next day. Yet the minister summoned up the ability to pray for them. He asked God to bless rather than curse his enemies.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>It’s one thing to agree with Jesus’ teachings; it is another to carry them out whilst blood seeps from your head. So maybe you’ve not been physically tortured, but perhaps emotionally you have. Maybe your heart feels black and blue. Maybe the last thing you want to do is pray rather than curse. Ask God for the courage to love your enemies—if you hate them, they have already defeated you.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Forgiving each other, just as... God forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Forgiving isn’t easy. It takes hard work, and determination, and the bigger the wound, the harder it is to forgive. So how about some practical ‘How–To–Forgive’ tips to help you?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>(1)<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> Deciding to ‘re–forgive’ every time old thoughts of unforgiveness pop into your head.</em> It’s a question of your will deciding to forgive, and forgive and forgive. Ask yourself if you have really forgiven them? Ask God to help you with those difficult memories, and decide to make peace with them until you feel the Holy Spirit doing its work in your heart. (2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Release poisoned relationships</em>—if you break free of a situation, keep a watch for people trying to drag you back. They may not even realise they’re doing it, but it’ll block your moving on. (3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Don’t be discouraged that it’s not instantly fixed. </em>Just as your salvation was immediate but you have to walk out your sanctification, so the release of your forgiveness is immediate but you have to walk out your healing. (4) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Living free from the burden of resentment and the toxicity of unforgiveness is a choice followed by a series of choices</em>. It’s a step–by–step thing, but with every step, it gets easier, and your feet get lighter.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Finally, ‘It is for freedom that Christ has set us free…’ (Galatians 5:1 NIV) God is in the business of freedom, and when you free someone or something that’s been a burden on you, the freedom you receive from Him for yourself overflows. So take whatever hurtful situation springs to mind as you pray today and use these tips to walk out your release.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood Passover: Exo 12:1-14, 1 Cor 11:23-29, Ps 69:7-21, Deut 21:22-23 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59309&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Or maybe you look at the stars of the screen and know you could do a better job if opportunity would throw you a lucky break. And maybe, just maybe, you’ve snored your way through one too many Sunday sermons, so you just know you could lead this church better than the current guy does. </span></p>

Why isn’t God promoting you to Vice President of the Universe? Could the answer lie in the Luke 16:10? ‘If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones...’ In other words, ‘you’ve got to start somewhere!’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>So before you lead millions in worship on CD, think about singing honestly to God alone in your bedroom. Or joining the choir. Before you start planning to lead a world–renowned church, try volunteering to clean your current church toilets. If you are faithful with a toilet brush now, you might just be faithful serving a large church in the future. In God’s eyes, it’s not about glam jobs, only faithful servants.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom...' Matthew 27:51 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Brief history lesson: Long ago there was a time when the high priest would go through the temple curtain to enter the ‘Holy of Holies’ (where God’s presence was) once a year. Once. And the only thing that qualified him to be there was the blood of a sacrificed lamb—nobody can physically come before God by themselves without purification. The blood was placed above the Ark of the Covenant. What’s that? Well, it contained God’s perfect standards, the ten commandments (and yes, we’ve all broken them). Now fast–forward to the moment when Jesus died on the cross. The blood of the ‘lamb’ was shed again, for us. The Bible states that the temple curtain, separating man from God, was torn in two (Matthew 27:51). And this is nothing less than wonderful news for us: when we reach out for God, when we seek God with honest hearts, He <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>will </em>reach back for us.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Which means that factually, without a doubt, no matter how you’re feeling today, you <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>can</em> ‘come boldly to the throne of our gracious God.’ (Hebrews 4:16 NLT) Even if you feel undeserving (and we all are), it doesn’t affect how much God longs for you to reach for Him. God doesn’t reside behind a curtain, He’s in us. HINT: ‘Your body is a temple.’ (1 Corinthians 6:19) So come boldly to the throne and ask God for what’s on your heart.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 6-7, Mt 27:26-32, Ps 75, Prov 10:22-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59311&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...&quot;Lord, remember me when You come into Your Kingdom.&quot;...Jesus said... &quot;Today you will be with Me in Paradise.&quot;' Luke 23:42-43 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>‘Good Friday’ always seems a strange way to refer to Jesus’ death. The ‘Good’ part is what Jesus dying on a cross achieves: that, through faith in Jesus anybody—<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>absolutely anybody</em>—can stand before Father God and be declared righteous. All because Jesus gave His life for you.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>So, to take a closer look at that today, we’re looking at the criminal on the next cross over. What better demonstration of God’s grace to us as undeserving humanity than seeing a guy who actually <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>deserved</em> his punishment being told he’ll be in Heaven with Jesus later that day? No action required. Not even a weeping confession. Just this: recognition of who Jesus was, and one request: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>...remember</em> me?’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Here’s why this is important to you: are you like that guy on the cross, all hope gone, and somehow deserving what you got? Turn your head to the side and look at Jesus taking everything you deserve. He’s offering you paradise.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Or do you know someone that’s ‘too far gone’ to ever be saved? The criminal was, literally, at the end of his life. He was a thief who’d made some ‘not exactly wise’ decisions and, if he had any friends or rellys who cared about what happened to him, you’d have understood if they’d given up hope... and yet... ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>...remember</em> me?’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>It’s not too late. For you, or someone you’re praying for. Keep praying. In fact, pray today as you read through the Gospel story of Jesus’ crucifixion (John 17–19), remembering what He has done to make it possible for you to be part of God’s family. </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood Good Friday: Gen 22:1-18, Mt 27:33-56, Ps 22, Is 53<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59313&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

It’s not the start of a joke, it’s a true story. Last year, an electronics store actually made applicants dance for each other as part of their interviews for sales jobs. ‘I just felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable,’ said Alan, one of the job hopefuls. ‘I ended up dancing and doing rubbish robotics in my suit in front of a group of strangers.’ Ouch.<br /> Poor Alan experienced the way shame makes us feel: alone, exposed, powerless. He said he felt like a fool and wished the ground would swallow him up. Who would willingly choose to feel shame in that way? Who, if they had the power, wouldn’t say ‘Stop! Enough!’?<br /> Jesus, that’s who. Isaiah writes, ‘He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and…he did not open his mouth.’ On the cross, in the face of all that shame, of brutal torture and gut–wrenching anguish, Jesus could have defended Himself. He could have appealed to legions of angels to rescue Him. All it would have taken was a word. But He chose not to. He instead chose to empty Himself of His power (Philippians 2:7-8) to fulfil the perfect plans of His Father. He did it for you.<br /> So, take some time now to thank Jesus for His willingness to humble himself so that we could know freedom. What does His example mean for you in your life?</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 8-9, Mt 27:57-66, Ps 130, Prov 10:24-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59314&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Can you imagine the victory laps Satan and his cronies were doing the day Jesus was crucified? They really thought that they had wrecked the greatest mission in history. They were convinced they had snuffed out the salvation plan of the Father. Lying in a cold dark tomb was their evidence—God’s only Son, broken, bruised, beaten.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>But the deceiver was deceived. As Philip Yancey writes in <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The Jesus I Never Knew</em>, ‘In the most ironic twist of all history, what Satan meant for evil, God meant for good. Jesus’ death bridged the gap between a perfect God and a fatally–flawed humanity. On Good Friday God defeated sin, routed death, triumphed over Satan, and got His family back… He took the worst deed of history and turned it into the greatest victory… Between the cross and the empty tomb hovers the promise of history: hope for the world, and hope for each of us who lives in it.’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>At the cross, Paul writes in Colossians 2, Jesus cancelled the record of wrongs against us, nailing them up. And He disarmed the devil and all the spiritual rulers and authorities at his command, nailing them down. He comprehensively triumphed over Satan. So, as you celebrate with God’s people today, keep Jesus’ victory over your sin and over Satan at the front of your mind.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood Easter Sunday: 1 Cor 15, Mt 28:1-10, Lk 24:1-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59315&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And at midnight a cry was heard...' Matthew 25:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jesus told a parable (that you might find isn’t mentioned all too often) about some bridesmaids waiting for the groom to arrive.</p>
<p>Five of them were wise, and five of them were foolish. Having a burning lamp was a requirement for taking part in the wedding feast in those days, yet the foolish bridesmaids didn’t have enough oil, so they tried to grab some from the wise ones. They replied ‘‘We don’t have enough for all of us... buy some for yourselves’ (v9). So the foolish bridesmaids had to trot off for oil. But while they were gone, the wedding got underway and the door was locked and bolted.</p>
<p>Here’s four lessons from the foolish bridesmaids: (1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>It’s wrong to depend on others</em>. The fact your mum and dad / church family are Christians won’t on its own make you a believer. You need to seek God for yourself. (2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>It’s stoopid to be last–minute about important things.</em> Are you putting off saying a full ‘yes’ to Jesus until you’re a bit older or you know more? (3)<strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;> </strong><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>God’s judgment is final</em>. ‘..the door was shut… “Open the door for us!” But He replied, “I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.”’ (Matthew 25:10–12 NIV) (4) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Morality alone won’t get you into Heaven.</em> ‘God saved you by His grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God.’ (Ephesians 2:8 NLT) Being generally nice unfortunately doesn’t make up for the wrong we’ve done; Jesus does. Are you fully trusting in God, or is your oil half–empty?... Meaning: are you not fully committed? Are you like someone trying to walk around with your feet pointing in different directions? See how easy it is (not!) and ask yourself, ‘Do I need to sort out my relationship with God?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['While the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered...' Matthew 25:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Let’s look a bit more into the story that Jesus told about the wise and foolish bridesmaids. In verse 5 it says this, ‘The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.’ So we’re all on the same page, the bridegroom in this story represents Jesus. Your average wedding service tends to involve us waiting anxiously for the bride to walk down the aisle, yet here, the bride (representing the true church) is waiting for the groom. Jesus, the person we’ve been waiting for, whom we depend on, is coming soon (Romans 13:11), yet we’re fast asleep.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>What do you think Jesus is getting at here? In 1 Thessalonians 5:6–8 it says, ‘...let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober... putting on faith and love.’ Are we preparing ourselves, actively seeking God on earth, or chasing after what will ultimately not count for much? (The answer’s probably found in the way you spend your time).</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>‘At midnight a cry was heard: Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!’ (Matthew 25:6 NKJ) Midnight? Eh? There’s no time God excludes (or is excluded from). Seeking after Him needs to be a whole–of–life endeavour—there’s never a ‘time–out’. So get wise today! Wake up and be prepared for Jesus by tucking into His Word.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 12-13, Mk 1:1-13, Ps 103:13-22, Prov 10:30-32<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59319&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened to them as examples...for us...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Over the next two days we’re comparing and contrasting two Bible characters, with a view to draw out some juicy wisdom. First, Mr. Samson. He was the product of a miracle (see Judges 13), brought up by godly parents and most famous for his supernatural strength. If he was the beefy, all–round superman of a guy that we often see depicted, he’d probably be all over your Twitter feed (#strongmansamson). Yet he ended up failing miserably (see Judges 16). Why? He didn’t pray. Most of the time, he relied on his own strength and wisdom rather than God’s. The only time there’s a mention about Samson praying was when he was in trouble. Ring a bell? We can’t be surprised if we live according to our will only, then wonder why we’re in a mess!</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>There’s another big decision–making lesson we can learn from him. Rather than being led by God’s Word, he was led by his feelings to marry the wrong woman, who eventually betrayed him. Being led by your emotions before checking in with God might feel ‘right’ for a short while, but never turns out too well. Samson sought revenge, but Joseph prayed for those who hurt him. He was motivated by greed, whereas Joseph worked hard.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Why mention these things? If it can happen to Samson, it can happen to us! Samson’s story is a good pointer to keep our God–given strengths in check... and check–in with God instead. What do people say you’re good at? Today make time to thank God for that, and devote it to glorifying Him.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 14-15, Mk 1:14-22, Ps 16, Prov 11:1-2<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59333&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>In brief, Joseph had his head screwed on. He wasn’t perfect, but we can certainly learn from the way he dealt with misfortune and rejection (compared to Samson’s set up in life), temptation (compared to Samson’s head–firstness), and his attitude.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>If you’re at all familiar with their stories, you’ll have noticed that Samson had everything going for him, while Joseph... well, didn’t. He didn’t get off to a great start; his brothers didn’t like the favour God had for him at all and they sold him into slavery. But Joseph forgave them (that’s massive), acted in faith that God was with him (<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Flashback to April 15</em>) and ended up helping his family out big time during famine.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>He also resisted temptation; turning down a married woman multiple times. He lived with determination to stay on track with God (Genesis 39:9). Yet it was because of this rejection that the married woman falsely accused him—and it was this that landed him in prison... where he became one of the leaders! (God was with this boy). </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Comparison time: Samson has a position of authority... Joseph ends up in prison. Samson goes for the girl his lust tells him to (and it ends badly)... Joseph resists temptation, and through his hard–times never turns his back on God... Who had it planned for Joseph to end up as Prime Minister. Samson lived out of his own strength, turning to God when times got hard. Joseph lived, trusting in God despite his situations, with massively different results.<strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> </em></strong>The Joseph story (Genesis 37–46) is about staying true.

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>How do we pray when we don’t feel in any way holy? Nobody feels incredibly devout 24/7. Motivation is important—we can’t always ride off the back of a wave of intense spiritual emotion. Sometimes, it’s clear and sunny outside, and you know you still have to fit in your morning’s fifteen minutes with God. Sometimes, the last thing you’ll want to do is listen to your depressed friend and quietly ask God to help them (while you could be happily zoning out to your favourite playlist.)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>CS Lewis said, ‘</span><span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>I</span><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;> must say my prayers today whether I feel devout or not; but that is only as I must learn my grammar if I am ever to read the poets.’ Yeah, poetry was the thing that got Lewis’s tastebuds tingling, but feel free to replace that with your own activity of choice... The point is that the ‘drudge’ of learning grammar (or lifting weights, or learning guitar chords) changes you. Not just in patience. You grow closer to an experience that is beyond flat, normal, just-getting-by human life. You start to change inside. This is especially true with prayer. Even when it looks like practice, speaking words to an empty room, you will be opening your life to God. And God, because He is good, will come along and meet you, because you have tried. Maybe you’re thinking: ‘Don’t believe the hype.’ Well, the core of prayer <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>is</em> very exciting—conversation with the Creator!—but in reality it doesn’t always feel like a life–changing experience. That’s ok. What’s your usual prayer routine? Go do that, even if it feels quiet. Don’t have one?

We don’t <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>always</em> exactly enjoy what we see in the mirror. Let’s face it, despite anything we might be taught in church about self–acceptance, it’s not easy to suddenly appreciate all your God–given features. Whatever you’ve inherited, there are some spiritual truths worth your time: (1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Truly resenting your looks puts you at odds with God the Creator</em>. The Bible says, ‘You have no right to argue with your Creator. You are…a clay pot shaped by a potter.

Just look to the famous people who seem to be dropping like flies; we ALL desperately need God to truly live. And, although it can be hard, let’s make sure that our conception of a ‘good’ appearance isn’t decided by what we see on our screens and billboards. An airbrushed model isn’t a role model. ‘…They are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!’ (2 Corinthians 10:12 NLT) Be careful.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>So, if we aren’t to compare ourselves to others, what option is left?

Some learning experiences we choose, and others, both good and bad, are thrust upon us. The story of who you are is written in your scars as well as your good experiences. They’re not coincidences. God is crafting and making you and building into you the ability to fly. So don’t shrink back into the goo, make something wonderful out of it all.

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>We each say around ten thousand words every single day. Give or take. Words that can cheer up and bless, or divide and put down. They can start wars or heal hearts. Just look at soap operas, where many of the plots are based around the loving or wounding words of broken humanity. Chances are, of those ten thousand words you speak each day, one or two may not be very well thought through. At least.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The Bible says, ‘If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless.’ (James 1:26 NLT) Oops.

(3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Speak truth and life</em>: Jesus is ‘...the way, the truth and the life.’ (John 14:6 NLT) As His family and followers, our speech should reflect this.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...He sought his God... And so he prospered.' 2 Chronicles 31:21 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>About 61% of Aussies claimed to be ‘Christian’ on the last census. But you wouldn’t know it by the number of people in church of a Sunday. Australians are also, according to a recent <em>Credit Suisse Global Wealth</em> report, the richest people on earth. How long can God’s favour last? It’s just like how things were in ancient Israel in Hezekiah’s time. In spite of all God’s blessings, many of the people there had turned their backs on Him. So as believers, how can we play our part in restoring God’s values in times like these? In Old Testament times, King Hezekiah set his heart on restoring God to His rightful position of leadership in the land and this is what he did:</p>
<p>(1) <em>He put God’s Word first</em> (2 Chronicles 31:4 NLT);</p>
<p>(2)<em> He challenged corruption</em> (2 Chronicles 29:5 NLT);</p>
<p>(3) He called the people to return to the Lord (2 Chronicles 30:6 NLT) and</p>
<p>(4) <em>He called people to worship God</em> (2 Chronicles 29:28 NLT). Most importantly: ‘In everything that he undertook…he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.’ (2 Chronicles 31:21 NIV)</p>
<p>The result? Israel was transformed. We need to play our part. As you watch or listen to the news today, find a story that you can pray about or act on. Ask your mates to pray too and to join with you in putting God first.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'A great...door has opened to me.' 1 Corinthians 16:9 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Paul writes, '<i>For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</i>' So, what are you focusing on? The open door or the adversaries - the opportunities or the obstacles?</p>
<p>Story time: In 1866, a newbie geologist (a rock geek) noticed some South African children playing with a shiny rock. He asked the kids' mother if he could purchase it. Thinking it was worthless, she gave it to him. Later, when he examined it, he discovered it was a premium 21 carat diamond. When word got out, a Scottish mineralogist (a mineral geek) named James Gregory was sent to investigate. He reported back that South Africa wasn't suitable for finding diamonds. He guestimated that the previous discoveries had resulted from ostriches, of all things, eating the gems in far-away lands and plopping them in South Africa by their poop. So gross! A few days after Gregory's report was made public, an 83 carat diamond was found in the area he had visited. It is now known as <i>The Star of South Africa</i>, and it began the region's first mining operation in what is today the world's largest producer of diamonds.</p>
<p>Well, what about Gregory? His name lives on, but not as he might have wished. In the diamond industry, when someone exhibits bad judgment, it's called '<i>pulling a Gregory</i>'.</p>
<p>So don't '<i>pull a Gregory</i>'; ask the God who opens doors to how you what you need to see. Remember, if Jesus could turn water into wine and feed five thousand people with a boy's lunch, think what He can do through you. The question is: what do you see? The open door or the obstacles?</p>

<p>Life in late 18th century England was horrific: kids as young as five were sent to work twelve hour days in dangerous conditions; public hangings were common and the conditions of prisons were unspeakable. When the jails threatened to overflow anyway, they shipped the prisoners half way around the world to a place called... yep, Australia. And then there was slavery - hundreds of thousands of human lives traded annually for money, money, money. Shockingly, most 18th century English people thought this was all perfectly jolly (or, at least, not changeable). There were even lots of church people who believed if you were born poor or black, the gutter was your lot in life.</p>
<p>Why would anyone take on that mountainous mess? Especially if you were well-educated, wealthy and insulated from the world around you? Well, thankfully, somebody did. God gave William Wilberforce a 'measure of faith' that came from his deep understanding of grace. Faith that his life could count. Faith that things could change.</p>
<p>What this measure of faith did in Wilberforce was cause him to use what he had, in the place where he was, to change the world. Jesus said: <em>'</em><em>I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &quot;</em><em>Move from here to there&quot;</em><em> and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.</em><em>'</em> (Matthew 17:20 NIV)</p>
<p>A mustard seed is a bit bigger than the size of the full-stop at the end of this sentence. Whenever you think you don't have what it takes to change a situation for good, think again. It doesn't need much when you trust in Jesus.</p>

<p>Jonathan Martin wrote about a missionary friend in Palestine: 'Sister Margaret was in the crowded village market one day when an angry man accosted her. Taking out his apparent frustration at Western military interference in the region, he began cursing her. He cursed... everything he could think of. She felt the eyes of the entire village watching. As he hurled abuse at her, she quietly prayed for wisdom. When he was finally done, Margaret responded, &quot;I am so sorry I hurt you. I never had any intention of hurting you. God loves you, and I love you. He loves this village and He wants to bless you. When you get over being angry, will you remember I'm still your friend?&quot; Perplexed, he turned and walked away. In words that are forever etched on my soul, Margaret said, &quot;Satan doesn't know how to respond to the gentleness of God's Spirit.&quot;'</p>
<p>'The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you...' (Romans 8:11 NLT) How do you live out that resurrected-difference when you're with your friends? When you get unfairly bad-mouthed? To respond in love very often means not just mimicking the way that the world reacts to things, but standing solidly and being a gentle, positive opposite.</p>
<p>When the rest of the world is too busy to care for individuals, do you choose to have an opposite spirit? Simple things - actually offering prayer for a friend with a headache or telling that mate who owes you ten bucks it's a gift - will set you apart.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Peter...not knowing what he said.' Luke 9:33 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p><br />Ever find yourself saying the wrong thing, at just the wrong time? Never fun, is it? Peter had a tendency to spill exactly what was on his mind. This meant sometimes he was spot on with what he said and sometimes he was way off. There were occasions when physically putting his foot in his mouth would actually have been more constructive than carrying on the conversation.</p>
<p>In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus praised Peter and said he was blessed for recognising Him as the Messiah. Then, just a few verses on, Peter put his foot in it (again) and Jesus rebuked him with the remark,<em> </em><em>'</em><em>Get behind me, Satan!</em><em>'</em> (Matthew 16:23 NIV)</p>
<p>Most of us have these ups and downs, right? Striding along confidently for God one minute, then falling over our own feet the next. Well, next up in the story, God gave Peter some pretty good advice that could help us all. Jesus took Peter, James and John up the mountain to pray, and while there, the disciples saw the glory of Jesus displayed as he met with Moses and Elijah. Peter, totally stunned, spoke impulsively, comparing Jesus and the Old Testament prophets as being equals. While still mid-sentence God interrupted him, saying, <em>'</em><em>This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to Him.</em><em>'</em> (Luke 9:35 NIV) They were all afraid and speechless after hearing that.</p>
<p>We can all use a bit of correction sometimes. To refocus and 'listen to Jesus' can be a make-or-break thing. The more you pay attention to what God has said, the less you'll say things that He wouldn't want you to say. So, if you find yourself in a situation where you think you might say something a bit brainless, take a breath, and pray for God's wisdom.</p>

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p><br />Recognise this situation? You're lacking sleep. It's late, maybe around midnight. And your thoughts go a bit... well, dark. This is a top time for doubt (over real life issues or God's goodness or sudden fear) to come out in full force.</p>
<p>Does that ever happen to you? Do you ever wonder why it happens? Don't worry. You're definitely not alone. It happened to the disciples in a night-time thunderstorm. '...He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, &quot;Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.&quot; And they launched out. But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm came down...and they...were in jeopardy. And they...awoke Him, saying, &quot;Master, Master, we are perishing!&quot;' (Luke 8:22-24 NKJ)</p>
<p>To the disciples, in the moment, doubt and fear felt like all there was to reality. Here's the thing though: these sorts of doubts don't sum you up and they're not the full measure of you. You can be aware of dangerous, not-from-God thoughts trying to get at you, but you don't have to be scared. 'Then [Jesus] arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water... But He said to them, &quot;Where is your faith?&quot; And they were afraid, and marvelled, saying to one another, &quot;Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!&quot;'</p>
<p>Whatever the storms of life, Jesus can calm them. No matter how deep your doubt or your fear, turn to Him and put your trust in Him. For He is the One with the power to command even the winds of fear and the waves of doubt to obey Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...And You say, Who touched Me?' Luke 8:45 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus suddenly stops in a marketplace and says 'Who touched Me?' No one owns up. Peter, in an almost You-can't-be-serious tone, pipes up, 'Master, the people are crowding and pressing against You.' But Jesus said, 'Someone touched Me; I know that power has gone out from Me.' (Luke 8:45-46 NIV)</p>
<p>Jesus knew the difference between the clumsy bump of a passerby and a deliberate faith-filled grasp. Peter was led by his human senses, Jesus was led by a more supernatural sense. He knew in His spirit that someone had touched the tassels on His cloak that symbolised prayer. With that touch, someone had prayed in faith and received an answer.</p>
<p>Because of her illness, the woman who'd done it held back from revealing herself. She was seen as cursed by the people. Now this same woman, made whole, dropped at Jesus' feet, trembling. Because Jesus called her, she could respond.</p>
<p>It's vital to our growth as Christians that we start to get in touch with Jesus too. Faith draws on His power and brings results! Notice, this woman touched the 'hem' of Jesus' garment, the prayer tassels. The last thing a tailor does when making a garment is to sew up the hem. So the hem represents 'the finished work'. The same back of Jesus that bore the cross to take away your sins, also bore the stripes which take away sickness. '...And by His stripes we are healed.' (Isaiah 53:5 NKJ) What do you need today? Forgiveness of sins? Healing for your body or mind? Reach out in faith and touch Jesus, and you too will be made whole.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'A dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest.' Luke 9:46 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Do you remember being little and having those 'my dad's the best' arguments? Then, we got older and it stopped being about mum and dad. Instead it became all about us. We don't often say it out loud (at least not in church), but in reality, our hearts can often drift towards a judgemental, self-promoting spirit, bigging ourselves up, assuming we're better than other people. It makes us feel secure.</p>
<p>Good to know it's not a new thing, then. Jesus discovered His disciples were arguing about the oh-so-mature topic of... 'Who will be the greatest?' Have you noticed, a lot about 'living for God' is living in opposites? Like loving your enemies instead of hating them? Forgiving people instead of making them pay? Putting others first, rather than ourselves? Well, when Jesus had a few words with His disciples about this argument over greatness, He didn't quote a great philosopher to make His point. Instead, He pointed at a child. 'Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me; and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For he who is least among you all-he is the greatest.' (Luke 9:48 NIV)</p>
<p>As long as your motive for serving is to make yourself look good, you'll never enjoy God's approval. And His 'well done' is the only thing that counts. So, if you've been bigging yourself up lately, take note of what Jesus said here and become teachable, trusting and tender-hearted, just like a young child.</p>
