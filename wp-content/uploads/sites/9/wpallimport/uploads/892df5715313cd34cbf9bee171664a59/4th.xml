<introtext><![CDATA[Pray about everything... Tell God what you need' Philippians 4:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>The four-year-old son of a missionary family in Africa spotted a picture of a little pink dinosaur in a magazine and set his heart on having one. His mum knew it was impossible (the magazine was three years old), but her son never doubted God would come through for him. On Christmas Eve, a box from home arrived. It had been packed and sent ten months earlier. At first glance it seemed to contain something special for everyone-except a four-year-old boy. </p>
<p>Then they reached the bottom-and they were stunned. The lady who sent the box had no way of knowing God would use her to answer a little boy's prayer. Before taping up the box, at the last minute, she tossed in the one item impossible for his parents to provide-something so insignificant no rational adult would ever have been foolish enough to ask God for it: a pink plastic brontosaurus from a fast-food restaurant promotion.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't bother God with the little things-but pink dinosaurs tell us we should. The Bible says: '...pray about <i>everything</i>. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done.' (Philippians 4:6 NLT) God is interested in every detail of your life; if something is important to you, it's important to Him. When you learn to trust God in little things, you'll be able to trust Him in big ones. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...be persistent in your prayers...' Ephesians 6:18 NLT<br /><br /><p>The trouble is, we just don't realise what we've got in our hands. We see prayer as some kind of inconvenient spiritual homework. We'd much rather <i>tap</i> fingers on the old console than <i>clasp</i> them in prayer. And so prayer becomes just like that overdue essay-left well past the deadline.</p>
<p>Imagine your rich uncle hands over his platinum card for some serious shopping. Do you hide the piece of plastic in your bottom drawer? Or do you taxi it down to retail rapture quicker than you can shout, 'Spend! Spend! Spend!' Our guess is your uncle will be re-mortgaging the mansion when he gets your bill!</p>
<p>So, why is it, that when our Almighty God offers to communicate with us anytime anywhere we file it with 'list of chores' to do? Yep, we enjoy an 'open heaven' with access to divine wisdom and guidance and a life-time supply of all we'll ever need-and yet we choose to spend all our time away from His presence.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 33:3 NIV says, 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great...things, which you do not know.' The answers you want are found on your knees. Luke 11:10 NLT says, '...everyone who asks, receives...' Jesus is clearly giving you permission to max out the prayer platinum. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 NIV says, 'Pray continually.' God isn't worried about the bill; He's expecting you to go a little crazy. Trouble is, you just don't know what you've got in your hands.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Strike the ground...' 2 Kings 13:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Sometimes God has people do the strangest things. In Hosea, God asked a holy man to marry a prostitute. In Ezekiel, a prophet was told to eat a paper scroll. And here in 2 Kings there's another bizarre request-a king is urged to throw a toddler's tantrum.</p>
<p>Jehoash-a lukewarm king, to put it kindly-is going head-to-head with their archenemies, the Syrians. But rather than dispatch a monster swarm of tanks or press the nuke button, Jehoash is told to win the war first by firing an arrow out the window and then by smacking the ground in a hissy fit. It's not exactly 'Call of Duty', is it? </p>
<p>Is God into big-time embarrassment or is something more going on? The clue comes later when the prophet Elisha fumes at King Jehoash's feeble efforts. The king, no doubt, felt a bit silly following God's strange instructions, and so he only obeyed half-heartedly. Elisha points out that because he only went so far, he will only get so far with his enemies. Sure, the king would have some success, but it wouldn't be until his son, Jeroboam, reigned that complete victory would come.</p>
<p>If you want to win battles in this life, you need to be fully committed in following God, not half-hearted. Even if you're being asked to do something that seems strange.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I shall go to him...' 2 Samuel 12:23 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Life is hard. Nobody gets a written note from God excusing them from life's toughest moments.</p>
<p>In 2 Samuel we read about David, a man who had it all. Then he lost what was most precious-his child. Listen to the heartbreak in David's words: 'Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.' (2 Samuel 12:23 NAS) David came face-to-face with a harsh truth: his child won't come back to him, but one day he will go to be with the child in Heaven.</p>
<p>Maybe you can relate to David's grief. Perhaps you've experienced someone's life cut short and you've found yourself asking: 'Will I see them in Heaven?' David's words should comfort you: 'I shall go to him.' David, a man completely tuned-in to God, is confident he will once again see his son in Heaven. You can have that confidence too. </p>
<p>Maybe you're wondering: 'Will I actually know them in Heaven?' The answer is yes! The reason lies in the story of the Transfiguration. The disciples recognised Moses and Elijah, even though these two Old Testament heavyweights had been dead hundreds of years. Perhaps <i>we</i> may not see <i>our</i> loved ones for another eighty years or so, but we will still recognise them. And we'll have eternity to get to know them. Life is hard. But one day there'll be no more tears.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Pharaoh...clothed him in garments of fine linen...' Genesis 41:42 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Check the tag in your coat-what does it say? Maybe, 'Outer lining: 100% nylon; inner lining: 100% cotton'. Wouldn't it be good if it read: Outer you: '100% approved; inner you: 100% honest'?</p>
<p>That's the kind of tag Joseph carried around in his amazing Technicolour Dream-coat. Joseph came 100% approved: 'Now [Jacob] loved Joseph...and he made him a coat of many colours.' (Genesis 37:3 KJV) Like the sparkling coat, the approval of God will cause you to stand out from the crowd; it will open doors, protect and promote you. Psalm 5:12 NKJ says, 'For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous; with favour You will surround him as with a shield.'</p>
<p>Joseph also carried the label 'honest' in his coat. This is the same coat Joseph left in the hands of Potiphar's wife when she was trying to mess around with him. Joseph kept his honest head on, keeping his hands off what wasn't his: 'When Joseph went into the house to do his work...she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand, and fled...' (Genesis 39:11-12 NKJ)</p>
<p>Be like Joseph. Keep your hands to yourself when you're presented with opportunity to sin, and keep your mouth zipped when tempted to have a good goss. When your '100% honest' tag itches the back of your neck, use it as a reminder to do the right thing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It does not worry in a year when no rain comes...' Jeremiah 17:8 NCV<br /><br /><p>Gap years. Not only will you be cleaning out toilets in Botswana for a year but you'll be charged three grand for the pleasure of doing it! Actually, maybe you secretly love the idea of serving the poor but the money aspect puts you right off. You have faith to believe that you could love an orphan out in India but when it comes to raising the price of the plane fare, that faith is suddenly AWOL.</p>
<p>If you're going to be dependent on God keeping you safe in some foreign land then why not start practicing now, by being dependent on God for the finance to get you there. Jeremiah 17:7-8 NCV should fuel your faith: 'But the person who trusts in the Lord will be blessed...He will be...like a tree planted near water...it does not worry in a year when no rain comes.'</p>
<p>'Nice verse,' you're thinking. 'But what's a tree got to do with my empty bank account?' Well, trees depend on rain to grow and produce fruit. A tree that can stretch out its roots to nearby water is no longer dependent on cloud-juice for its water. Likewise, you don't necessarily need to do ten years of extra shifts at Macca's to source the cash for your trip. God can supply if you'll just ask. So ask Him, then ask God's people.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will instruct you...in the way you should go...' Psalm 32:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>You wouldn't walk into oncoming traffic wearing a blindfold, would you? So, why does walking with God often feel like something similar? It's almost as if you can hear life's challenges hurtling towards you, ready to run you down. Yet God still calls you to carry on, despite the accidents that could occur.</p>
<p>Walking with God isn't always a pleasant stroll in the park. Walking with God sometimes means heading into trouble. Jesus promises it: 'If people did wrong to Me, they will do wrong to you, too.' (John 15:20 NCV)</p>
<p>You'd think the closer you get to God, the easier things would become. But Paul found the opposite true: 'I don't know what will happen to me there. I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that trouble and even jail wait for me. I don't care about my own life. The most important thing is that I complete my mission, the work that the Lord Jesus gave me...' (Acts 20:22-24 NCV) What?! Paul is walking step-by-step with God and yet <i>prison</i> is the pot of gold at the end of his rainbow?</p>
<p>God never promised a bed of roses; in fact we all know the story...He <i>promised</i> crucifixion for the Author of our faith. Today's thought is not an easy one: are you willing to walk in faith with God despite the oncoming traffic?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' Proverbs 10:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>Solomon never wrote, 'The lips of the godly are glossed with sarcasm' or 'The mouths of the righteous can chew you up and spit you out.' Know why? Because 'godly' means behaving like God. It means we need to be holy and watch what we say. Do you think Jesus took Peter aside for a word in his ear: 'See that Judas bloke? I trust him about as far as I can launch him; he's sooo going to get it!'</p>
<p>It doesn't fit with His character, does it? Jesus was totally holy. </p>
<p>Perhaps if your tongue only spoke blessing you'd be nearer the holy mark too. Like, instead of using it to mouth off about next door's annoying kids, why not make friends and speak positive words into their lives? Or instead of moving those lips to moan about everything that's wrong with the world, why not do something about it? Like, speaking up about fair-trade products or persecution or human trafficking.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes, it's the smallest things you say that have the biggest impact. Like thanking a teacher after a good lesson or commenting on your mum's new hair-do. After all, a small compliment is far godlier than a sly dig, don't you think?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' Proverbs 10:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>'God-gloss' gives you beauty inside and out. So if you want to glow, apply godliness to your lips every day.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's nothing more attractive than handing out encouragement with your smile: 'Kind words bring life, but cruel words crush your spirit.' (Proverbs 15:4 GNT) Ella Wilcox once said, 'A pat on the back is only a few vertebrae removed from a kick in the pants, but miles ahead in results.' Seriously, a snide comment may get a quick cheap laugh, but a word of support can last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Secondly, 'healing' is such a good look to apply to your face: 'Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.' (Proverbs 16:24 NIV) People with loads of inner struggles can start to be healed through a card, an email or even a text from you. Proverbs 25:11 NCV tells us: 'The right word spoken at the right time is as beautiful as gold apples in a silver bowl.'</p>
<p>Finally, the best shine you can apply to your lips is the sparkle of salvation. The most beautiful thing in the universe is telling people about Jesus: 'The words of a good person give life, like a fountain of water...' (Proverbs 10:11 NCV) You can speak life-giving words to those who are lost, making beautiful their past, present and future.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>&amp;nbsp;'...If God is for us, who can be against us?' Romans 8:31 NKJ</p>
<p>You know those people who seem to have 'God's favour' stamped on their passport to life? Most of them have been to rock bottom at some point. Many of the Bible's heroes faced a lot of un-super stuff before they were raised to starry heights.</p>
<p>Take David, the man described as Israel's greatest ever king. Long before he was being measured up for his crown and robes, God had him endure instruction in the toughest boot camp. First he was trained in obscurity-unseen, unappreciated and unknown. The only applause David received growing up would have come from his sheep flock.</p>
<p>Teenage David was far from Mr Popular. He was stuck out in the hills with the world's most unglamorous job. Yet coping with being a 'nobody' qualified him to be the big 'somebody'. Secondly, he was trained in monotony. Years before fine wines and food fit for a king, he lived a simple everyday existence. Endless hours of farming come rain or shine, he could be found doing plain old, dull L.I.F.E. Being consistent in the boring stuff grounded David for all the amazing stuff later on.  Not feeling much of 'the glam' lately? Good. It means you're in training.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Love...keeps no record of being wronged.' 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NLT<br /><br /><p>When it comes to 'love', different people seem to be reading from different dictionaries. To Mr Drunken, 'love' is just a word used in an attempt to take advantage of the young lady next to him whereas to Miss Gush Gush Chick, 'love' is what you fall in when you spy the latest clothes catalogue. The Bible has one or two thoughts on the 'L-word' (and get this-not one mentions puppy dogs, bling or hearts with arrows scrawled through them). So wrap your mind around this: Love-the real definition...</p>
<p>I may give away everything I have, and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned. But I gain nothing if I do not have love. Love is patient and kind...is not jealous, it does not brag...is not rude...not selfish...does not get upset with others...does not count up wrongs...is not happy with evil but is happy with the truth... It always trusts, always hopes, and always remains strong. Love never ends. There are gifts of prophecy, but they will be ended... There is the gift of knowledge, but it will come to an end. The reason is that our knowledge and our ability to prophesy are not perfect. But when perfection comes, the things that are not perfect will end.' (1 Corinthians 13:3-10 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[You who judge others do these very same things.' Romans 2:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>Heard the one about the woman who peered out her window every morning just to have a good gossip about the state of her neighbour's dirty washing? One morning she noticed it was sparkling clean. 'Maybe she's ditched that cheap washing powder,' she sneered. 'Or maybe I got up early and <i>cleaned</i> <i>our</i> <i>windows,</i>' piped up her hubby. Gotcha! </p>
<p>We need to be on red alert to 'dirty window syndrome'. Maybe you recognise the early symptoms in yourself: You 'tut-tut' over your mate's choice of boyfriend and in the next breath <i>you're</i> drooling over the school bad boy. You're quick to pull up your mate about her gossiping, but not so quick on <i>yourself</i> when using prayer as an excuse for tongue-twitching: 'Can we just pray for my friend, she's sleeping around...' You're shocked to hear old Scrooge never puts a penny in the collection, but <i>you</i> think nothing of short-changing your parents.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote about 'greed, hate, envy, murder, quarrelling, deception... gossip' (Romans 1:29 NLT), surely he didn't mean you, right? But he goes on to say, '<i>you</i> are just as bad... <i>you</i>...do these very same things.' Paul knows about our 'dirty window syndrome'-judging other people's dirty laundry through our own grimy eyes.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the speck of dust in your mate's eye, learn to deal with the plank in your own. Hmm, now where have we heard that before?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...we felt like grasshoppers next to them...' Numbers 13:33 NLT  	<br />When you come up against a giant, either your faith will cause you to soar or your fear will cause you to sink. The Israelites died about 30 km from the Promised Land, walking around the desert in circles. Why? Because they let their fear get the better of them: 'We even saw giants there... We felt like grasshoppers next to them.' If you're to see (and seize) what God has promised you, you'll have to conquer your giants. Now, you have the power to, but do you have the guts to? Joshua and Caleb looked upwards with the eyes of faith, even when everyone else started to look down and get depressed. 'The whole congregation...said...&quot;Would to God that we had died...in the land of Egypt...&quot;' (Exodus 16:2-3 KJV) These guys were on a serious downer! This is someone with a 'grasshopper mentality': (1) They constantly talk about life's injustices; about how they've been mistreated and misunderstood. To them Paul answers, '...endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.' (2 Timothy 2:3 NKJ) (2) They make excuses for not conquering in life. Sometimes they even put others down because they are stepping out in faith. To them Paul writes, '...in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.' (Romans 8:37 NIV)  (3) They complain about what they don't have instead of focusing on what they do. To them Peter writes, 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us...' (2 Peter 1:3 NIV)  Sound like anyone you know (including yourself)? Get to know God better. That's how to move from a grasshopper mentality to a giant-killer mentality! <br />SoulFood: Jer 51-52, Matt 7:1-14, Ps 137, Pr 15:15-17<br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2011 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=24868&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></span>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[...add to your faith, goodness...' 2 Peter 1:5 NIV<br /><br />If you think you can play fast and loose with the world's rules and expect your non-Christian mates to follow God's, you're dreamin'. Instead of preaching Jesus, live Jesus. If living Jesus means leaving that party early, set your mental alarm to leave when you should. If living Jesus means keeping quiet when everyone else is going gossip-mad, keep it zipped. And if living Jesus means spending a bit more on ethical clothing rather than penny-pinching at sweatshop city, splash the extra cash.  What you say will go in one ear and out the other; what you do will be noticed. Standing out from the crowd is top of the Kingdom Job Description. People know when you're wearing 'what would Jesus do' round your wrist but 'what I want to do' round your heart.  2 Peter 1:5-7 GWT tells us what to aim for: '...make every effort to add integrity to your faith; and to integrity add knowledge; to knowledge add self-control; to self-control add endurance; to endurance add godliness; to godliness add Christian affection; and to Christian affection add love.' See, you can't tell someone you're a 'good Christian friend' and then never invite them round for tea nor can you show 'good character' by partying through every Saturday night. Your best preach will be the one you live; so live Jesus.<br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 8-10, Matt 12:22-37, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 16:25<br /><br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2011 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=24894&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></span>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[You have been wandering around...long enough; turn...' Deuteronomy 2:3 NLT <br />Choices, choices, choices-they're all around you. Whether it's options, uni, job, church mates, what to do, where to go... the list sometimes seems endless, doesn't it? Do you ever feel like you're walking round in circles with all the choices, with no idea which way to turn to make sure you end up in the right place? And you know that it matters too-some of these choices are life-changers, and you don't want to end up doing the wrong thing, or in the wrong place.  You're not alone-Israel had the same problem in the Old Testament, wandering about in the desert, not knowing where to go next. God stepped in and told them what to do (read the whole story in Deuteronomy). Some of the stuff He told them to do probably seemed a bit scary or crazy to them-but what God said, happened. He'll do the same for you too, if you ask Him.  The question is: will you trust Him enough to turn around and go wherever He says, making the choice He tells you, even if it seems a bit scary or not the most logical option? It's worth it if you do-because that's when you'll end up where God wants you-and when you're in the place He wants, that's when He'll use you best to do His work through you.

<introtext><![CDATA[How are the dead raised? With what kind of body?' 1 Corinthians 15:35 NIV  	<br />There's no shortage of fascination with the afterlife, the supernatural, life beyond death. It's right there in films, in books and on TV. But how do we know what is really true? What really happens? Jesus tells us a few things about Heaven. First, it's real. Jesus said, 'There is more than enough room in My Father's home. If this were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?' (John 14:2 NLT) Secondly, you're invited. Jesus said, 'When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with Me where I am.' (v3) And third, there's only one way to get there: Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through Me.' (v6) In Luke 23 we read how 'they nailed Him to the cross. And the criminals were also crucified-one on His right and one on His left.' (v33) One of them went to Heaven when he died, the other didn't. One choose to reject Jesus: 'One of the criminals hanging beside Him scoffed...'(v39) But the other criminal believed in Jesus, saying, 'We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn't done anything wrong.' Then he said, 'Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.' Jesus said, 'I assure you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.' (vv40-43 NLT) Do you believe in Jesus or scoff at Him? Your answer will have a dramatic effect on whether you get to see Heaven or not. <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 20-21, Matt 10:21-31, Ps 14, Pr 16:6-7<br /><br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2011 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=24886&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></span>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Keep your lives free from the love of money...' Hebrews 13:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Wanna scare your careers adviser? Tell them you want to be a poet or a sleigh-rider or a Sudoku designer. Watch them flap as they say, 'Right...but what about something to fall back on?' You see, there isn't much money in poetry. Jobs in Sudoku construction are few and far between. Here's the thing though: why not follow your heart rather than the dollar? </p>
<p>It's true we all need money to survive but money isn't the be-all of life. Hebrews 13:5 NIV tells us to chill out on this score: 'Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, &quot;Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.&quot;'</p>
<p>Don't let finance dictate your future. People get all twisted up in knots, staying awake at night, stewing over money. It's as if money will solve all their problems. Cash is a mixed blessing because it gives us independence. Being self-sufficient means we no longer need God to provide, which in turn means we no longer automatically go to God for help, which in turns means we miss out on relationship with God as our provider. </p>
<p>Yesterday's devotional looked at you being made for a mission. That's the point: keep your focus on your mission, not your wallet. Billy Graham said, 'If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area of his life.' So: 'Keep your lives free from the love of money.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Two are better than one...' Ecclesiastes 4:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You've probably heard the story of Moses and the Ten Commandments before, but instead of focusing on Moses, let's take a look at his brother Aaron. The brothers worked together as they campaigned for freedom for the Jews, and as they crossed the Red Sea, and as they began their journey through the desert. Then it all went pear-shaped. Moses went up a mountain to spend time with God, leaving Aaron with the rest of the Israelites. He was gone so long that the people thought he wasn't coming back. The pressure grew on Aaron to provide a God they could see. It got too much and he ended up making a golden idol for them.</p>
<p>When Moses came back down and saw what Aaron had done, he confronted him. But Aaron blamed everyone else: 'You know how prone these people are to evil. They said...make us gods... they gave me gold and I threw it into the fire.' (Exodus 32:22-25 NIV) But Aaron wasn't the only one to struggle during the journey. Moses found that being the sole problem-solver was more than he could handle. His father-in-law had to tell him: 'You cannot handle it alone...select capable people...that will make your load lighter...' (Exodus 18:17-24 NIV) Ever wonder why Jesus sent His disciples out in twos instead of solo? Because when we've got the right person by our side, we have support, encouragement and-protection. Protection from what? Ourselves! If we're serious about walking with Jesus, accountability is a step we must be willing to take. So, who are you accountable to?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come...' Malachi 3:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>We've all played it and maybe even still do-hide and seek! You go off to hide and then your friend tries to find you and vice-versa. Playing it with small children can be scary. They can be so good at it, you start believing they must have been abducted by aliens-it's the only explanation, surely?</p>
<p>Do you ever sometimes feel that God is playing hide and seek with you? One minute being a Christian feels great; you have amazing experiences of God; you feel Him with you big time, all the time; you ask questions and you get answers; He gives you visions, pictures, words of wisdom; you hear His voice and then... ... ...nothing! It's like He's hiding-you can't see Him or hear Him anywhere. And it's usually at a time when you feel like you need Him the most. You turn to Him and it feels like He's gone. You're left crying: 'Where are you, God? I need you!'</p>
<p>Don't rely on your feelings. God promises: 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NIV) When things get tough, God promises: 'When you pass through the waters...they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned...' (Isaiah 43:2 NIV) If you're feeling like God has deserted you, know for sure 'the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...we become more and more like Him.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>When we're growing up, we all have our own ideas of who we want to be, how we want to dress, what we want to do. We form our own opinions and they're the ones that matter, we want to be our own person. It's never music to our ears when we hear: 'Ooh, you look just like your mum' from Auntie Ethel, and 'Oh, you sound just like dad' from Grandad Tom. Yeah, sometimes we want to dress like our friends, follow the latest trends and copy styles-but it's our choice, right? We're still our own person!</p>
<p>When we read in the Bible that 'we should become more like Him'-like Jesus-it can freak us out. It's not about growing a beard, moving to Israel and wearing a long robe (makes your school uniform suddenly sound very appealing, doesn't it?) And there's no need for that panic attack thinking all Christians are supposed to become clones of one another (imagine church services where the people look like they've been photocopied over and over!)</p>
<p>God's talking about Character Building, not Christian Cloning, when He says, '...throw off...your former way of life, which is rotten through and through... You must display a new nature because you are a new person, created in God's likeness-righteous, holy, and true.' (Ephesians 4:22-24 NLT) Make this your No.1 priority!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...we become more and more like Him.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>At the end of His life, Jesus declared His mission a success by saying: 'I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You gave Me to do.' (John 17:4 NIV) David writes, 'Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory...' (Psalm 115:1 AMP) The breath you took as you read that last sentence was given to you for one reason: that you might 'reflect the glory of the Lord...' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV) The way Moses led Israel changed after he prayed, '...show me Your glory.' (Exodus 33:18 NCV) We cross a line when we make such a request. When our deepest desire is not the things of God, or the favour of God, but God Himself, we cross a threshold. Less self-focus, more God-focus. Less about us; more about Him. This calls for the death of ego. It rubs us the wrong way. It's a truth we must constantly remind ourselves of: '...God made all things, and everything continues through Him and for Him. To Him be glory forever!' (Romans 11:36 NCV) And if you still haven't got the message: '...there is only one God, the Father, who created everything, and we exist for Him...' (1 Corinthians 8:6 NLT) Why does the earth spin? For Him. Why do you have talents and abilities? For Him. Whose Word matters? His. Whose will must be done? His, not ours. God's to-do list consists of one item: 'Reveal My glory.' Heaven's framed and mounted statement of purpose reads: 'Declare God's glory.'

<introtext><![CDATA[...we become more and more like Him.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>Eight times in the New Testament, we're told to 'make every effort' to be like Jesus. You don't just veg out on the sofa and wait for it to happen. The apostle Paul explains our three responsibilities in becoming like Christ: </p>
<p>(1) Changing our habits. Your character is made up of the sum of your daily habits. Listen: 'You were taught to leave your old self-to stop living the evil way you lived before. That old self becomes worse, because people are fooled by the evil things they want to do.' (Ephesians 4:22 NCV)</p>
<p>(2) Changing our thinking. The Greek word for 'transformed'-<i>metamorphosis</i>-is used today to describe the amazing change a caterpillar goes through in becoming a butterfly. It is a superb picture of what happens to us when we allow God to shape our thought life. As we spend time talking to God and reading His Word, we take on the beauty of Christ's character; we leave behind those caterpillar limitations. Paul says: '...be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' (Romans 12:2 NIV) </p>
<p>(3) Changing our clothes. God's Word says, 'Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves...' (Colossians 3:12 NIV) Most people wouldn't go to a party in a school uniform; you need to dress yourself in the right gear to make the most of the moment. So in life put on the right things: '...clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility and patience.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...along unfamiliar paths I will guide them...' Isaiah 42:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Don't ask God to bless your plans, ask Him to show you His-they are already blessed. When the time is right the plan will be clear, the people in place and the resources available. Peter writes: 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life...' (2 Peter 1:3 NIV) Did you hear that? Everything! God told Abraham when to leave home (see Genesis 12:1), and Jacob when to go back home (see Genesis 31:3). He even told Elijah where to find food in the middle of a famine (see 1 Kings 17:1-5). And His promise to you is: '...along unfamiliar paths I will guide them...' The path you are on today may be unfamiliar to you but it's not to God. He has already gone ahead of you. All you need is the faith to step out and follow Him.</p>
<p>God never changes. If He talked to people all through the Bible He'll talk to you too. Question is: <i>Have you learned to recognise His voice yet?</i> Nothing should be more important to you than learning to hear from God for yourself. Other people's ideas should only confirm or clarify what He's already shown you. If you have not heard from God you will be tempted to think that human ideas are His commands-and that could hurt you. Listen: God has a personal plan and a specific destination for you. Take the time to ask Him about it. His Word says, 'He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.' (Psalm 25:9 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[I will guide you along the best pathway for your life...' Psalm 32:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Solomon says, 'Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' (Proverbs 19:21 NIV) Even though your plans aren't perfect, if your heart's motive is right, God will make things work out for your good and His glory. Are you having difficulty sorting out your ideas from what He is saying? We all struggle with that, especially when the Bible doesn't give us specifics. For example, when it's time to go to uni or marry or get a job, what should you do? Listen: 'I will guide you along the best pathway for your life.' You say, 'That's nice, but I'd like a little more detail.' Ok:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Ideas go away but God's direction stays</i>. God moves at His pace and He invented you and time, so He can make it work! There is persistence in His leading. That is why time is on your side. Do not rush ahead of Him. </p>
<p>(2) <i>God's direction is impossible to follow without Him.</i> He plans it that way. Jesus said, '...without Me you can do nothing.' (John 15:5 NKJ) </p>
<p>(3) <i>God's direction usually begins with discomfort.</i> Listen: 'like an eagle that stirs up its nest...The Lord...led him...' (Deuteronomy 32:11-12 NIV) Eagles learn to fly when their mum pushes them out of the nest and over the cliff's edge. Can you imagine their thoughts? 'Mum, what are you playing at!' But it's only when the eagle is forced out of its comfort zone that it discovers it was born to fly, spreads its wings, releases its power and finds its place in the heavens. Has God been stirring up your nest? Relax! He's leading you! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...He will direct your paths.' Proverbs 3:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Here are some examples of when hearing God about something makes all the difference. (1) <i>Future choices</i>. When trying to decide what's next, look carefully at your options and ask God to make the right one clear. (2) <i>Before you make a choice based on someone else's idea.</i> Why? Because people's ideas aren't God's commands. Don't commit yourself to stuff you can't do and end up trapped by promises you can't fulfil. Be there for people, but be led only by God's Spirit. (3) <i>When someone's being awkward.</i> What people say can totally effect how we think. Don't make bad decisions because your mate is being moody-that can prevent you making the right choice. (4) <i>At a tough time</i>. Don't change your college course just coz it's a bit tough...take a minute and ask what God wants you to do. If someone asks you to do something, think first...is this something that is going to be pleasing to God? (5) <i>When you're tempted</i>. Don't just cruise along with the crowd. Often saying 'no' is the right answer. Think: 'Is this in tune with God's heartbeat?' (6) <i>When you have popularity</i>. A compliment is always nice but don't let it navigate your decisions. Flattery just inflates the ego and can make it tough to hear God clearly. Some people will be excited by your dreams because they don't have their own...but are you ready to carry passengers? It's wise to share your heart with people you know have a good relationship with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[For it is God who works in you...' Philippians 2:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>You can't put your life into compartments by saying, 'In this category I'm gonna do things my way, but in that category I'm gonna be led by God.' Every step you take must be synchronised with the beat of God's heart! Nothing is more important than keeping pace with Him. Listen: '...God...works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.' (Philippians 2:13 NIV) God works through us as we engage our minds, open our mouths, move our feet and use our hands to do what He has already put into our hearts. The moment you say 'yes' to God He gives you what you need to do what He asks. Check this: He doesn't show His will to you first, then call you next. No, He calls you, and as you move out and obey Him He shows it to you step by step, helping you as you go.</p>
<p>God is never content with the 'normal'! Never! Every day in different ways He will develop you into a greater God-carrier. You're not out for a stroll, you're on a mission. Again and again you will be given challenges and be put into situations that will mature you to the point where you have the same attitude, the same responses and the same desires as Jesus. When you start to understand that, walking with God will take on a whole new meaning. Realise that your walk with Him is the only walk that will ever satisfy you or fulfil your purpose for being on this planet.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[We...would prefer to be...at home with the Lord.' 2 Corinthians 5:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>The sense that we will live forever-somewhere-has shaped every civilisation in history. In the pyramids of Egypt, the embalmed bodies had maps placed beside them as guides to the future world. In AD 125, a Greek named Aristides wrote, 'When a Christian passes from this world, they rejoice...and escort his body with songs of thanksgiving as if he were setting out from one place to another nearby.' In 1952 young Florence Chadwick stepped into the Pacific, just off Catalina Island, determined to swim to the mainland of California. She'd already been the first woman to swim the English Channel both ways. The weather was foggy and chilly; she could hardly see the boats accompanying her. Still, she swam for 15 hours. When she begged to be taken out of the water, her mother, who was in a boat alongside, told her she was close and that she could make it. Finally, physically and emotionally exhausted, she stopped swimming and was pulled out. It wasn't until she was on the boat that she discovered that the shore was only about a kilometre away. At a news conference the next day she said, 'All I could see was the fog...I think if I could have seen the shore I would have made it.' </p>
<p>Heaven is not a myth; it's a magnet that pulls us in the direction of home. A home, which Paul describes as 'better by far'. (Philippians 1:23 NIV) No matter how tough life gets, keep your eyes on the heavenly shore; draw strength each day from God, and you'll make it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.' Colossians 3:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Gary Larson captured a common misconception of Heaven in one of his <i>Far Side</i> cartoons. In it a man with angel wings and a halo sits on a cloud, doing nothing. A caption reads: 'Wish I'd brought a magazine.' How come we talk so little about Heaven? Why has it fallen off our radar screens? Listen: '[Satan] began to curse God, His name, the place where He lives, and all those who live in Heaven.' (Revelation 13:6 GNT) Satan bad-mouths three things: </p>
<p>(1) God's person</p>
<p>(2) God's people</p>
<p>(3) God's place-Heaven. After being evicted from Heaven (Isaiah 14:12-15), it must be maddening for him to know we're now entitled to the beautiful home he was kicked out of. What better way for him to attack us than to whisper lies about the place Paul tells us to set our minds on? If we believe his lie we'll set our minds on this life, not the next. And we won't be motivated to take others with us. CS Lewis writes, 'The Christians who did the most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next. The Apostles...who set on foot the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle Ages, the English Evangelicals who abolished Slave Trade, all left their mark on Earth-precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world, that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at Heaven and you will get earth &quot;thrown in&quot;, aim at earth and you will get neither.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...we felt like grasshoppers next to them...' Numbers 13:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>You'll never know what you're made of spiritually until you come against something too big to handle alone. That's when you discover what you really believe. Moses sent twelve scouts to the Promised Land. They weren't the kind with badges on their sleeves for making campfires and tying knots, but spies sent to check out Israel's new homeland. They all saw the same thing: a land rich in honey, milk-and giants! Now that was literally a <i>big</i> problem! Acknowledging or knowing there's a problem isn't lack of faith. And it's not a sin. Paul said, '...we wanted to come to you...but Satan stopped us.' (1 Thessalonians 2:18 NIV) He knew there was a problem! The difference between the scouts was in how they saw the problem. Ten said, 'We saw the giants...and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers,' but two scouts called Joshua and Caleb said, '...don't be afraid of the people of the land...The Lord is with us...' (Numbers 14:9 NLT) Real faith feeds off the stuff the enemy throws at you. Like the scene with Neo from <i>The Matrix</i>, faith has its arm stretched and beckons with its fingers: 'Bring it on! The Lord is with me!' </p>
<p>The negative report of the ten spies caused three reactions in the people:</p>
<p>(1) Fear. Fear is irrational. It can make you forget every good thing God has promised, or done for you. </p>
<p>(2) Some wanted to go back to Egypt-back to how things used to be. </p>
<p>(3) Others wanted to settle in the wilderness. You've got to move with the cloud, otherwise today's manna is the last you'll see. </p>
<p>So, is the God you serve bigger than the giant you see? He says He is.  </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[Everyone followed their old customs...' 2 Kings 17:34 CEV<br /><br /><p>Old customs' are like habits. Things you get used to, and do without even realising it half the time. Here, the people were in bad habits-their 'customs' meant they weren't worshipping God properly, and weren't being obedient. They kept on feeding the habits every day by not changing things-and the longer you do that, the harder the habit is to break. </p>
<p>When a habit is really deeply rooted, it can mean you have to hit rock-bottom before you even realise it's all gone wrong. So habits are really important things to get right-and what better time to start developing good habits and getting out of bad habits than right <i>now</i>?</p>
<p>Now, by 'bad habits', I'm not talking about things like biting your fingernails or interrupting a teacher in class and, by 'good habits', I don't mean always using a tissue when you sneeze or saying 'please' and 'thank you'. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, those things all make sense-but even more important are the habits you get into when it comes to your relationship with God. It's the most important relationship of your life, so you need to get it right. Many of our habits and customs are set when we're young-so get them sorted now. How? We'll look at that tomorrow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Everyone followed their old customs...' 2 Kings 17:34 CEV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever noticed that you end up acting a bit like your mates when you've spent loads of time with them? Well, why not get into the habit of spending loads of time with God-every day, even-and maybe then you'll end up acting more like Him. Pretty good habit, hey? </p>
<p>Do you find it hard to read your Bible when all your favourite shows are on at night? Make it a habit that you don't put the TV on when you get in from school or work until you've spent at least ten minutes in your room hanging out with God. Have you got a habit of gossiping with your mates, and criticising people behind their backs? Instead, get into the habit of praying for the people you struggle with every day. (You don't have to be kneeling with your eyes closed to pray-you can do it silently in your head whenever you see them.) </p>
<p>Do you always press 'snooze' on your alarm on a Sunday morning, and end up missing church, thinking 'it's ok, there's youth group on Thursday'? Get in the habit now of setting your alarm earlier and getting out of bed and into church instead-where better to hear from God than in His house? When you're too old for youth group, it's better to already be in the habit of meeting up with other Christians regularly, than having to start afresh. Make your habits good ones today.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[They go from strength to strength...' Psalm 84:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Going from strength to strength.' Sounds like a pretty good plan really, doesn't it? I mean, who wants to go from weakness to weakness? No one! So, how do you actually achieve going from 'strength to strength'? Well, it's all about growing, changing and building up the right muscles. </p>
<p>Think about all the athletes training for the 2012 Olympics for a minute. When they're working out and training, they'll all have coaches nearby, won't they? It's the job of the coach to point out where an athlete's strengths and weaknesses are, tell them where they're going wrong, and what to change to get better. The athlete chooses whether to pay any attention to the coach or not-but chances are, if they don't, they won't become the best. The coach is an expert, and only suggests changes and training to help them get better. Yeah, it'll probably be hard work: they'll have to try new things and scrap old ways they thought were good. But if they're committed to being the best, they'll listen to the coach and they'll likely get better.</p>
<p>What's that got to do with you? Well, you may not be training for the Olympics, but you do have a top-class coach watching your every move, just waiting to give you advice. He wants to help you become the best by changing the way you're doing things, and go from strength to strength. Who? God the Holy Spirit. So what are you waiting for-ask Him to coach you today.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[...everyone who has will be given more...' Matthew 25:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>Every accomplishment in your life starts with a decision. It's not chance or fate that determines your destiny, but your choices. Jesus told the parable of the talents: a businessman gave three employees talents to invest. The first two doubled theirs. The third one buried his. Scared of losing it, he didn't even take a tiny risk. '&quot;You bad and lazy servant!&quot; his master said. &quot;You knew, did you, that I reap harvests where I did not plant, and gather crops where I did not scatter seed?&quot;' (Matthew 25:26 GNT)</p>
<p>God wants us to do the best with what He gives us, and that involves us making choices, and sometimes taking what feel like massive leaps of faith: 'without faith it is impossible to please God.' (Hebrews 11:6 NIV) Have faith that God will be with you when you make those tough choices, and that He's given you the skills to do what you need to. Don't waste the talents God has given you by being too scared to use them. Jesus ended His parable saying, '...to everyone who has, more will be given... Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away.' (Matthew 25:29 NKJ)</p>
<p>Your goal should be to 'maximise the investment' on <i>everything</i> you do. To get more, you must use what God's already given you. When you step out in faith, God moves, and extraordinary things happen. When you limit what you <i>will</i> do, you limit what you <i>can</i> do. Just think: if you don't act now, what could you be missing out on later?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you...' Philippians 3:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you get everything right first time? Be honest, and I bet the answer is 'no', isn't it? So why do you assume that others should? The people you admire and look up to won't always get it right first (or second, or third, or fourth...) time either! Paul understood that we <i>all </i>make mistakes, and sometimes we need to hear things loads of times before we eventually get it-which is why he said, 'It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.'(Philippians 3:1 NIV) He understood that you have to <i>keep</i> hearing and doing it in order to get it right.</p>
<p>So, next time you're in church or youth group, and the talk sounds familiar, or even when you're reading <i>word4U2day</i> and it's a favourite old theme popping up, instead of switching off and thinking, 'They're not still on about that <i>again</i>,<i> </i>are they?', why don't you listen, and ask God if there's still something you can learn from it? </p>
<p>If not, appreciate that there may be others who need to hear that message again. Maybe, the reason they're still 'on about it' is because<i> </i>God's told them too-and until <i>you</i> get what He's trying to tell you, they'll just keep on going! </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[...we are knocked down, we get up again.' 2 Corinthians 4:9 CEV<br /><br /><p>Do you ever feel like you keep getting knocked down, and as soon as you pick yourself up and brush off the dust, you're knocked down again? It makes you feel like a failure, but get this-YOU'RE NOT! </p>
<p>Pretty much every time you're knocked down, if you stop and look, you'll learn something. So although it may not feel like you're getting anywhere, when you look back you'll see that with each fall, you've taken a little step further forwards. It's so easy to focus on the negatives because the devil is spending all his time trying to make you feel like rubbish, a pathetic failure. You don't want him to win, do you? No! So next time you're knocked down and feeling beaten, try saying, 'Take a hike, Satan, you're not gonna keep me down.' Keep going with a smile on your face, thinking about what you can learn from the latest fall.</p>
<p>Remember too, that the things you do with ease now weren't that easy to start with. An article in <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>said: 'You've failed many times...you may not remember. You fell the first time you tried to walk... Did you hit the ball the first time you swung the bat?... the ones who hit the most home runs, also strike out a lot.' </p>
<p>Getting knocked down certainly doesn't make you a failure-but getting back up again is the key to becoming a success.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Nothing is hidden from the Lord, and He judges what we do.' 1 Samuel 2:3 CEV <br /><br /><p>Don't try and trick God-He can see right through you! He can look right past what you're doing to what's going on in your heart. Yeah, it's great if you're doing fab things for others, being a real 'good Samaritan'. But if you're only doing it to impress someone, then God won't think much of it. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you're not making an impact with God, what's really the point of whatever you're doing? God is the ultimate judge. He's the one who created you so He's the one whose praise you should be seeking. </p>
<p>Learn from Jesus' teaching at the Sermon on the Mount. 'Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in Heaven.' (Matthew 6:1 NLT) It's really not worth it, is it? While you're at it, why not go one step further-and act so that you're glorifying God, not yourself? Jesus also said, '...let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.' (Matthew 5:16 NLT) </p>
<p>Remember today's word-nothing is hidden from God, and He's the one who will ultimately judge you-so check out your heart today. Is it ready for God to look at?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Love is always supportive, loyal, hopeful, and trusting.' 1 Corinthians 13:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>Before you switch off, thinking, 'Mushy stuff? Er, no thanks!' just stop a second. Even if you haven't got that special someone in your life who sets your heart racing and makes you weak at the knees, you'll still have friends and family who you love. (Go on-admit it!-you do care, don't you?) </p>
<p>So maybe it's worth stopping for a second, and seeing what we can learn about loving better. Here are just two top tips:</p>
<p>(1)<i> Don't just use your ears to listen. </i>Listen to the things people don't say, as well as the words they do. If your mates and family feel like you're really paying attention to their lives, they'll feel more loved and valued-which has got to be a good thing, right?</p>
<p>(2)<i> Believe the best (and forget the rest!)</i> So you'll have probably seen them at their worst-but reminding them of all that isn't necessarily going to make them feel supported, is it? Instead, focus on the best, remind them of the good times, tell them they do something well. </p>
<p>Yes, it's still really important to let them know if they're doing something dodgy, and to correct them gently if they keep mucking up in the same way-but it's just as important to give encouragement, whether they need it or not. Who knows-you might just make their day! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Acts 20:35 NCV<br /><br /><p>Errr, what? How backwards is that? Just what is this verse going on about?! </p>
<p>Ok, don't panic-no one's disputing that it's great when you get an awesome present, and this verse isn't saying it's wrong to get prezzies at all. What it does teach us, though, is that it's really important to give, as well. That doesn't mean God is saying you have to save all your hard earned cents and splash the cash on a complete stranger. But maybe it's time you had a think about what you <i>could </i>give to bless others around you. </p>
<p>How about offering to babysit, doing the shopping for your gran, or helping out the younger kids at Sunday school in church? You may be thinking: 'Yeah, but why bother?' Well, the simple answer is, you should bother because God wants you to. That's all the reason you need. As a child of God (that's what you are, by the way!) you should want to please Him-and He loves it when His children give to each other. </p>
<p>But get this-the added bonus is that when you do give, you'll end up getting blessed too! I can't tell you how or when-that's not how it works-and that shouldn't be your reason for doing the giving (remember, God knows what you're thinking), but God loves it so much when we bless others to please Him, He blesses us too! Win-win all round. So what are you waiting for? Get giving today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[I will praise You more and more.' Psalm 71:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you ever watched a little kid learning to ride a bike? Maybe you even remember it yourself? There are tears and tantrums as they can't balance, fall off, get grazed knees, have to have training wheels or help from dad. It looks like they'll never get the hang of it, and they want to give up so often. But dad patiently keeps encouraging them, that it'll be worth it when they can-and, like the old saying goes, once you've learnt to ride a bike, you never forget. Before they know it, the kid is sailing off on their own, having fun with friends, enjoying the freedom that comes with cycling.</p>
<p>Praising God can be a bit like that-daunting to start off with, coz it seems like a mammoth task. (I mean, where do you even start, right?) However once you've started, and got it, it's great, and you may not even want to stop. It's so worth it when you do start praising. </p>
<p>The more you praise God, the more thankful you are to Him, the more you realise just why He needs praising, so the more you want to praise Him... you get the picture! So why not make the first move today? Start praising-just think of one thing you're grateful for. Then another. Before you know it, you'll be sailing off into the distance, praising God, wondering what took you so long, and maybe even enjoying it and encouraging others to give it a go too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[My mouth is filled with Your praise...all day long.' Psalm 71:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>Sometimes, it's the hardest times in our lives-the times when we least feel like praising God-that we really need to make the effort to do it anyway. It may feel like everything's gone wrong, things can't get any worse, and praising God is the last thing on our minds. </p>
<p>But just stop and think for a minute. Is ignoring God going to help at all? Um, no. Is whinging to God going to make you feel any better? Um, not really. So-why not give it a go, praise Him, and see what happens! </p>
<p>Check out the story in Acts 16 of Paul and Silas when they were in prison. They'd been badly beaten, were locked up when they didn't deserve to be, and were under special guard. Things couldn't have been much worse. So what did they do? Not what you'd expect at all. They didn't grumble or moan about the injustice of it-instead, then sang praise to God. At the top of their voices! </p>
<p>They trusted that no matter what, God was still an awesome God, and still worthy of praise. No matter how bad their situation was, God was still in control. And when they were singing and praying God moved in an amazing way. So today, why not stop moaning and start praising-it's not always easy, but it's powerful stuff, and God's worth every bit of it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[No...messenger [is] greater than the one who sent him.' John 13:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Corns and calluses, bunions and blisters, cracked heels, fungus nails and athlete's foot: feet can be disgusting! Their stinky, sweaty, smelly stench can make you throw up-have a sniff of your sneakers, if you don't believe me!</p>
<p>Peter knew this, which is why he said to Jesus, 'You will never ever wash my feet!' (John 13:8 NLT) Jesus washed all His disciples' feet that day and He explained why: 'Unless I wash you, you won't belong to Me... I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.'(John 13:8;15 NLT)</p>
<p>Now before you go running for a foot spa, Jesus wasn't saying: 'Be a chiropodist'! He was saying, 'Be humble, serve one another'. A humble individual does things without thinking, 'What's in it for me?' Being humble comes with benefits-we get:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Inside</i> <i>info</i>: God lets us in on stuff. Psalm 25:9 NLT says, 'He leads the humble in doing right, teaching them His way.'</p>
<p>(2) <i>God's help</i>: Life's tough and we need help. God promises to look out for the humble. Psalm 147:6 NLT says, 'The Lord supports the humble, but He brings the wicked down into the dust.'</p>
<p>(3) <i>To please God</i>: When you know God, you want to please Him and being humble is the way. The Lord says in Isaiah 66:2 CEV: 'The people I treasure most are the humble-they depend only on Me and tremble when I speak.' 'I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble...' (Ephesians 4:1-2 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[After you have suffered...He will place you on a firm foundation.' 1 Peter 5:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Lizards, snakes, and spiders have something in common. They leave their old skins behind. Snakes shed their skin by brushing against something, like a rock, creating a rip in their skin-usually by its nose and mouth. The snake then works on this rip until it can shed its skin completely. They leave a long old scaly snakeskin and slither away with brand new, bigger and better, skin.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 NLT tells us: 'anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!' This is just the beginning. We need to keep on growing up in this new life Jesus has given us.</p>
<p>Snakes don't just shed their skin once-they do it up to six times a year because if they don't, they won't stay healthy. We are a new creation and that doesn't change but we still need regular 'Spiritual Skin-Shedding Check-ups'. Staying away from church and letting your Bible gather dust can cause spiritual malnutrition and stunt your growth: '...let God transform you...by changing the way you think...' (Romans 12:2 NLT) 'Strip off every weight that slows [you] down, especially the sin that so easily trips [you] up.' (Hebrews 12:1-2 NLT)</p>
<p>Things can go wrong for the snake. Their skin can become too dry to shed and bits that stay attached become diseased. Growing up isn't easy but it's worth the effort-God promises '...after you have suffered a little while, He will restore, support, and strengthen you, and He will place you on a firm foundation.' (1 Peter 5:10 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Go! I am sending you...' Luke 10:3 NIV<br /><br />
<p>A missionary in Africa was once asked if he really liked what he was doing. His answer shocked people. 'Do I like this work?' he said. 'No. My wife and I do not like dirt... We do not like crawling into vile huts through goat refuse.'</p>
<p>This man knew that sometimes God asks you do the very thing you don't want to-and for him and his wife, it was stepping across animal poo! He wasn't happy about it, so why did He do it? He went on to say, 'But is a man to do nothing for Christ he does not like? God pity him, liking or disliking has nothing to do with it. We have orders to &quot;Go&quot; and we go. Love constrains us.'</p>
<p>It wasn't easy for Jesus to do what God asked either, but He never backed down. Are you doing what God is asking you to do? You're on a mission: 'We must keep our eyes on Jesus, who leads us and makes our faith complete. He endured the shame of being nailed to a cross, because He knew that later on He would be glad He did. Now He is seated at the right side of God's throne! So keep your mind on Jesus, who put up with many insults from sinners. Then you won't get discouraged and give up.' (Hebrews 12:2-3 CEV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[He always does exactly what He says.' 2 Corinthians 1:19 TLB<br /><br />
<p>The scenario: They seem too good to be true; laid-back, fantastically fit, genuinely interested in what you've got to say. After hooking up, you start to think the unthinkable-they're the 'perfect dreamboat date'. Unfortunately, they forget to mention they already are 'the perfect date'-somebody else's!</p>
<p>Why is it in life that anything that seems 'too-good-to-be-true' usually is? The 'perfect' couple splits up. The 'perfect' friend stabs you in the back. The 'perfect' preacher caught red-handed. It's hard when the people you love and respect let you down; it shakes your world and you're left with that nagging doubt, 'Can I trust anybody?'</p>
<p>Perhaps, without realising, you carry that distrust into your faith. You pay lip-service when it comes to believing God is good but deep down your heart hesitates. Best not get your hopes up in case this God stuff turns out 'too-good-to-be-true'.</p>
<p>People may let you down but God won't: 'He always does exactly what He says. He...fulfils all...[His] promises.' (2 Corinthians 1:19-20 TLB) Now there's a verse to hang your hat on when everything seems out of focus. When that long streak of trials and troubles seems never-ending, that verse reminds you to cling by your fingernails to the promises God has given you. Holding out during life's storms is a sure-fire way to cultivate character and fire-blast your faith. Cling to God; He's too good to <em>not</em> come true on His promise.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[It is time to seek the Lord...' Hosea 10:12 NKJ  	<br /><br />You can do it anywhere! In your bedroom, in the kitchen, in the garden, on holiday; by the pool, up a mountain, in church, in the shops or on the bus. You can do it with one person, a group of people or just by yourself. The important thing is that you do it! Sometimes you might not want to; you're not in the mood; you don't think you're good at it; you think you're too young or it's not really important for you to do it right now. Sometimes you want to do it but you're scared of doing it wrong, you're frightened you'll mess it up. But no reason for not doing it is going to cut it-you have to do it! It can be anywhere, but it must be somewhere! It can be anytime but it must be a set time. Without prayer, what do you have to draw on? If you're spending hours watching TV but say you've no time to pray 'it is time to seek the Lord.' If you're living comfortably with sins that once troubled you, 'it is time to seek the Lord.' Prayer-there is nothing better. If you've come this far with little prayer, inconsistent prayer, or no prayer, think how far you'll go when you begin to pray. 'It is time to seek the Lord.' <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 22-23, Matt 10:32-42, Ps 65, Pr 16:8-9<br /><br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2011 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=24886&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></span>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Seventy years are given to us!... But...soon they disappear...' Psalm 90:10 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Today we need to ask ourselves, 'What am I doing with my time?'</p>
<p>You might think it doesn't matter: 'I've got all the time in the world, I can do what I like when I like!' When we think like this, we act like this-our actions always reflect what we're thinking: 'For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.' (Proverbs 23:7 NKJ)</p>
<p>Thinking we have all the time in the world means we don't bother doing things now-we can just do it tomorrow! But tomorrow never comes. We waste our time; we never get as fit as we can, as healthy as we could be, we never read enough, we ignore our family and our friends. God drops to the bottom of the heap. 'What, prayer? Bible study? Church? Tomorrow, next week, once the summer is over, after Christmas... yeah, I'll do it then!'</p>
<p>We don't have all the time in the world. Listen: 'Seventy years are given to us! Some even live to eighty. But...soon they disappear.' So give up your 'I'll do it tomorrow' attitude, because tomorrow never comes. Start living now! Don't waste the time God has given you, don't miss out on being the best you can be: 'for we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.' (Ephesians 2:10 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[My entire lifetime is...but a breath.' Psalm 39:5 NLT <br /><br />
<p>What difference does it make, what I do with my time?' Good question! After all it is your life, isn't it? You never asked to be born, so you can do with it what you want, right?</p>
<p>But what if how you lived now and what you choose to do with your time affected your future... a life beyond death? In the big scheme of things, our moment in history is summed up by the psalmist who wrote: 'My entire lifetime is...but a breath.' But God promises us many times that it is possible to live forever-there is life beyond death.</p>
<p>Listen: 'For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 6:23 NIV) And in John 11:25-26 NLT, Jesus says, 'I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in Me will live, even after dying. Everyone who lives in Me and believes in Me will never ever die.'</p>
<p>Read the book of Ecclesiastes and you'll hear from the richest, smartest man who ever lived. Solomon had everything you could ever want and more! No one could outsmart him-he was the wisest around. But with all that he had and all that he knew even he came to the conclusion that life is 'meaningless', it has no point, no purpose-unless it's lived knowing God. Our time is wasted and gets us nowhere unless we use it chasing after God, doing God stuff.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...seven times he said, &quot;Go again.&quot;' 1 Kings 18:43 NKJ<br /><br />
<p>There's a strange little bit in 1 Kings 18. For over three years there has been a drought in the land. Elijah the prophet has just witnessed God embarrass the beliefs of all false-god followers at Mount Carmel. And then, after promising rain to end a record-breaking dry spell. Elijah bows before God and tells his servant to go and look for signs of heavy clouds. Trouble was, the clouds were nowhere to be found. Seven times Elijah told his servant to go back and look for signs of rain. Only on the last time did the sky show the smallest sign of a cloud. And yet a few verses later we read about a black sky, a rising wind and heavy rain.</p>
<p>This odd weather forecast story teaches us about the unseen nature of faith. Elijah believed for rain even though he lived in a world of catastrophic drought. Even though the sky showed no promise of rain. Even though-six times-nothing has happened. It would have been easy to match up what he's seen with what he's said and come to the conclusion that maybe he's wrong. Faith asks us to believe despite what we see. Faith asks us to persist on believing despite what results we're experiencing. Faith asks for God's reign even in what seems like a long spell of drought.</p>
<p>Have you got the faith to believe for revival in this country's long drought of hearing the Word of God?</p>

<p>As you sent Me into the world, I have sent them into the world.' (John 17:18 NIV) Know who said those words? Know who He was talking about? Yup, you guessed it: Jesus was talking you up for a serious mission.</p>
<p>God started a major bit of reconstruction work in the world with the mission of Jesus and now He wants you in on the job. Your mission is two-fold: to lend support to other Jesus followers and to make Jesus known to His non-followers. Here are some things to be aware of to help you:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Look within you.</em> What moves you? What are you excited about? Paul said, '...I am compelled to preach...' (1 Corinthians 9:16 NIV) Maybe the thought of opening your mouth in front of heaps of people gives you the shakes, but there'll be something that you feel compelled to do. Answer that and you have a good clue for your mission.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Look behind you</em>. What has life taught you? Your experiences could be the key to helping others. If you know what it feels like to feel alone and unwanted, part of your mission will be to get alongside others who are going through the same and show them love and acceptance.</p>
<p>(3) <em>Look ahead of you</em>. Where everybody else is blind, what do you see? Your mission is to say something with your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[I have called you by your name; you are Mine.' Isaiah 43:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Have you noticed how everyone seems to have an opinion about you? And how so many people are quick to drag you down? Sometimes it's too hard to ignore what they say and we let their words rob us of our self-worth. Our self-esteem hits rock bottom-words like, 'I don't love you anymore', 'you're stupid', 'you're useless', 'you'll never learn', 'I wish you'd never been born', 'why can't you be more like your sister?' can leave us feeling like old bubblegum that's been scraped off the bottom of a shoe.</p>
<p>God wants you to know how precious you are, how valuable, how important you are to Him. You matter-He loves you just as you are. Listen to some of the things God says about you and never lose sight of your true value, your true worth. No matter what opinions others may form of you, it's only God's opinion of you that really matters.</p>
<p>...the Lord who created you says, &quot;Do not be afraid-I will save you. I have called you by name-you are Mine... your troubles will not overwhelm you... the hard trials that come will not hurt you. For I am the Lord your God, the holy God of Israel, who saves you... I will give up whole nations to save your life, because you are precious to Me and because I love you and give you honour. Do not be afraid-I am with you!&quot;' (Isaiah 43:1-5 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[God has come to test you...so that you will not sin.' Exodus 20:20 GNT<br /><br /><p>Tests, exams: you can love them or hate them, pass them or fail them, but you can't avoid them! Sometimes they seem pointless, other times like your whole life depends on them!</p>
<p>In Exodus, Moses told the people; 'God has come to test you...so that you will not sin.' God had given them rules to live by, to test they were living right. Not a list of do's and don'ts to spoil their fun, but commands for their protection and profit. </p>
<p>Jesus teaches us the importance of passing God's test: 'Anyone who listens to My teaching and obeys Me is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. Though the rain comes...and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse, because it is built on rock. But anyone who hears My teaching and ignores it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will fall with a mighty crash.' (Matthew 7:24-27 NLT)</p>
<p>It's no good stashing our Bible in the back of the cupboard or skimming over the words and getting the general gist. We need to 'eat them up', know them and act on them if we are to pass the test of life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[God has come to test you...so that you will not sin.' Exodus 20:20 GNT<br /><br /><p>Chuck Swindoll tells the story of a bird named Chippy: 'Chippy the parakeet never saw it coming. One second he was peacefully perched in his cage singing, the next he was sucked in, washed up, and blown over. His problem began when his owner decided to clean his cage with a vacuum. She stuck the nozzle in to suck up the seeds and feathers at the bottom of the cage. Then the phone rang. Instinctively she turned to pick it up. She'd barely said 'hello' when-sswwwwPPPPP! Chippy got sucked in! She gasped, let the phone drop, and snapped off the hoover. With her heart in her mouth, she unzipped the bag. There was Chippy-alive, but stunned-covered with heavy black dust. She grabbed him and rushed to the bathtub, turned on the tap full blast and held Chippy under a torrent of ice-cold water, power-washing him clean. Then she did what any compassionate pet owner would do: she snatched up the hairdryer and blasted the wet, shivering little bird with hot air.'</p>
<p>Swindoll ends his story with these words: 'Chippy doesn't sing much any more.' In an instant, that parakeet's life went from Chirpy Chatty Chippy to Cheerless Choking Chippy. Life may throw you some tough tests, leaving you feeling like Chippy: vacuumed up, ice-blasted and blown to bits! But God doesn't want you to let them steal your song! '...the Spirit also comes to help us...' (Romans 8:26 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[God has come to test you...so that you will not sin.' Exodus 20:20 GNT<br /><br /><p>A little boy was playing in his sandbox. Sitting in the middle, surrounded by his toys, he began to dig when he came across a huge rock. He dug around it but the rock was too big and his hands too little to lift it. So he pushed the rock with his feet to the side, but he couldn't roll it up over the little edge to get it out of his sandbox. The little boy grunted, struggled, pushed and shoved-but his only reward was to have the rock roll right back, smashing his chubby fingers. Finally, he burst into tears of frustration.</p>
<p>All the while the boy's dad was watching. The moment the tears started, a large shadow fell across the sandbox. It was his dad. Gently but firmly he said, 'Son, why didn't you use all the strength that you had available?' Defeated, the boy sobbed back, 'But daddy I did! I used all the strength I had!' 'No, son,' corrected the father kindly. 'You didn't use all the strength you had. You didn't ask me.' The father then reached down, picked up the rock and removed it from the sandbox.</p>
<p>Sometimes things happen that appear too difficult, but God doesn't expect us to handle things by ourselves, He's always there to help. Psalm 46:1 NIV says, 'God is our refuge and our strength, an ever-present help in trouble.' With God we can get through anything, so don't sit and struggle on your own-ask for His help.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Be strong in the faith, just as you were taught, and always be thankful.' Colossians 2:7 NCV<br /><br />
<p>Once upon a time we all learnt to tie our shoelaces, perhaps with a little rhyme to help us along. But there definitely came a time when we no longer needed to ask 'how?' We just knew, so we stopped asking and just got on with it! We learn new things all the time, and when we've got it sussed we stop asking and just do it.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is about having a relationship with Jesus, getting to know God. What He likes, what He hates (yes, there really are things God hates-check out Proverbs 6). We learn what life's about, where we fit in, the things Christians should and shouldn't do. But there comes a time when we know it. We don't have to ask, 'What's that about?' because we just know. God expects us to just get on with it: 'Be strong in the faith, just as you were taught, and always be thankful.' (Colossians 2:7 NCV)</p>
<p>Don't wait around until you know everything about the Christian faith before you live it. That's never going to happen. Simply learn some, then do it. No more sitting around or hiding away.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[May integrity and honesty protect me, for I put my hope in You.' Psalm 25:21 NLT<br /><br />
<p>It might not seem like a big deal now, but later in life if you realise you don't have this, you'll realise what a difference it can make. It's a powerful force: it can stop you getting sacked from a job, prevent you getting locked up in a cell, prevent a marriage break-up and can even help out any children you may have. Yes, we're talking <em>integrity</em> again!</p>
<p>Guard my life...let me not be put to shame... May integrity...protect me.' (Psalm 25:20-21 NIV)You can't buy it and you don't get it overnight. It's like a muscle-the more you use it the stronger it gets. It's like a plant: the more you water it, the bigger it grows, the deeper its roots go. Which is why, even though it may not seem like a big deal now, you need to start doing something about it now!</p>
<p>Surf through the Old Testament and you'll bump into Joseph and David. They lived at different times but went through similar experiences-both met a 'strictly off-limits' sexy stunner when they were in a position to say, 'I'll have that, thank you very much!' Joseph said no. David said yes.</p>
<p>David's loss of integrity brought consequences. Later, once corrected and with a repentant heart, he wrote '...May integrity...protect me...' (Psalm 25:21 NLT) Wherever you are and whatever you're doing, decide to live a life of integrity-it will have a massive effect on your future.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Encourage him...' Deuteronomy 1:38 NKJ<br /><br />
<p>Did you ever dream of being a superhero? Come on-admit it! You spent hours designing your outfit and choosing your super power, didn't you? Well, you might not think of yourself like <em>The Incredibles</em> or <em>X Men</em> but God has given you a super power already. Really! Right now, today, you have the super power to give courage to everyone you meet. Awesome or what? All you need to do is start encouraging people.</p>
<p>It's weird, isn't it-if someone annoys us, we want to go in all guns blazing (and often do!) But when someone is really kind and goes out of their way for us, we're not usually so quick to rush in to say 'thank you'. Even random strangers can get a mouthful if they look at us the wrong way but the random stranger who's nice and friendly towards us, we hardly notice. It seems that offering them a word of encouragement is just a big 'no-no'!</p>
<p>Encouragement means 'to give courage'. God told Moses to encourage Joshua, because He knew by doing so, Moses would give Joshua the courage he needed to be the next leader of the Israelite people. When we encourage people we can make people feel big when they're feeling small, we can make people feel hopeful when they have failed. We can give people the power to keep on going when they've been feeling like giving up. Be a superhero and use your God-given super power-encourage!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[The Lord gave me just what I asked for.' 1 Samuel 1:27 CEV<br /><br />
<p>Hannah was the fourth woman in the Bible to find life really difficult because she couldn't have any children. Members of her own family kept mocking her because of it. But Hannah never lashed out at them, she just quietly kept on asking God to work a miracle in her life and give her a son. After many years God did! Hannah was so thankful! But the thing that is so great about Hannah was that she was always thankful to God, even before He gave her what she wanted. She had an attitude of gratitude-what about you?</p>
<p>Psalm 118:1 NIV says, 'Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever.' We need to have an attitude of gratitude to our Maker. This is more than a quick 'cheers for the grub, God' said before we eat a meal. It's about knowing that all we have, our very existence, is a gift from God. Being thankful to God in everything. Not something we simply say-but the way we live.</p>
<p>If you are truly thankful for your food, you will share it. If you are truly thankful for others, you will serve them. If you are truly thankful for the things you have, you will let others use them. If you are truly thankful for your intellectual gifts and talents, you will use them for good. If you are truly thankful for being born in a free country, you will help those who weren't.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress...' 1 Timothy 4:15 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Spiritual discipline'-two words most of us can't stand. What do they mean? They mean making ourselves do stuff that doesn't come easily in order to know God more. It doesn't sound like much fun, and often it's not. But it's absolutely essential if we want to get anywhere with God! It's important to remember that Satan will make you think it's really hard and not worth it so you don't even bother to try. In reality though, when you're closer to God and growing, it's worth everything you did to get there! Developing spiritual discipline is demanding, mostly done in secret and usually humbling.</p>
<p>Demanding? Absolutely. It means being harder on yourself than you want to be. You need to think about your speech, relationships and life choices. If they're not good enough, change them! Done in secret? Too right. Talk is cheap. Telling everyone everything that's going on is not wise. How do you know someone's wise? A good sign of wisdom is someone who thinks carefully before they speak! Humbling? Oh yes! Realising your weaknesses and all the areas you need to change and grow is never going to make you feel great! Spiritual discipline means that you stick with it while others make excuses and fall away. Listen to Paul: '...I run straight to the goal with purpose in every step... I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.' (1 Corinthians 9:26-27 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...I have acted with integrity.' Psalm 26:1 NLT<br /><br />
<p>To protect themselves from the barbaric hordes from the north, the people of China built the Great Wall. It was so high nobody could climb over it and so thick nobody could break through it, so they settled back to enjoy life. During the first hundred years of the wall's existence, China was invaded three different times. Not once did the enemy try to break down the wall or climb over it; they simply bribed the gatekeeper and marched in. Can you believe they could let this happen? What went wrong? Lack of integrity!</p>
<p>Integrity means doing the right thing-even when no one is looking. Integrity keeps us close to God. It stops us making foolish mistakes that damage our lives big time. It's why David writes to God in Psalm 26 asking Him to check him out and make sure he's living a life of integrity.</p>
<p>So here's your rough guide to living a life of integrity: Ask yourself the following questions: (1) Am I the same, no matter who I'm with? (2) Am I willing to make decisions that are best for others, even though another choice would benefit me more? (3) Can I be counted on to keep the commitments I've made to God, myself and others? (4) Do I do the right thing-even when no one is looking?</p>
<p>If your answer to these questions is either is 'no', 'sometimes', or 'hmm, not sure'-in short anything other than 'yes'-then ask God to help you get your integrity act together.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy.' John 10:10 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Using his own home as a demo, TV anchorman Brandon Brooks showed his viewers how to protect their homes from robbers. He installed double locks on all the doors, windows that can't be opened from outside, sophisticated alarms-the works. But what he failed to take into account was that thieves were also watching and learning the details of his security system and where everything was located in his house. The following week, while Brooks was live on air, they cleaned him out-because that's what thieves do!</p>
<p>Sometimes we can forget about that as Christians we have an enemy, Satan. Satan is a thief! Jesus said he 'comes only to steal and kill and destroy.' In John 8:44 NLT Jesus says, 'the devil...has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him... He is a liar and the father of lies.'</p>
<p>Right back at the beginning of time, the devil was so devious he managed to convince Adam and Eve (who had everything and who were with God every day) that, actually, God was holding something good back from them! Instead, he robbed them of all they had and they missed out on God's best for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Don't make the same mistake-run to God not away from Him. Watch out! Don't believe Satan's lies-get God's best for you. Jesus said, 'I have come that [you] may have life...to the full.'(John 10:10 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing.' 1 Corinthians 13:3 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Every teenager has a parent problem. It doesn't matter how great you are or how understanding they are, teens feel blamed for everything and parents feel their kids are not very helpful. There are loads of reasons for this-and it depends on which side of the story you listen to as to who seems more reasonable! But what happens when life gets so bad you're constantly at each others' throats? In fact, what happens when you're not getting along with other people too? Everyone has hurts and pains: undealt-with issues that can make you act or react a certain way. At some point those issues will surface. Then, who do you take it out on? Those closest to you. In times of need we often use the people we need most-those who love, care for and support us-as a verbal punch-bag. If you feel you're always to blame for things you haven't done, chances are the person blaming you is having a hard time and is expressing the pain they feel in a poor way. So how do you react? Well it's simple:  with love. In the midst of a fight with your mum, stop and tell her she's looking nice today. When arguing with your dad, ask him if he'd like a cup of tea. If your little brother's winding you up again, tell him you love him and mean it! It's impossible to fight with someone who is showering you with love and compliments! Love will calm a situation, stop an argument and bring you together. During your next fight, give it a try.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Pray like this...' Matthew 6:9 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Jesus had something to say about prayer: '...when you pray, don't be like those people who don't know God. They continue saying things that mean nothing, thinking that God will hear them because of their many words... [Instead] pray like this: &quot;Our Father in Heaven, may Your name always be kept holy. May Your Kingdom come and what You want be done, here on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us the food we need for each day. Forgive us for our sins, just as we have forgiven those who sinned against us. And do not cause us to be tempted, but save us from the Evil One.'(Matthew 6:7-13 NCV)</p>
<p>When we pray the way Jesus taught us, it sets us straight, puts life into the right perspective. What else?</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> It reminds us who we are and Who we belong too: we are in God's family and no one can ever change that! He promises: 'I am with you always.' (Matthew 28:20 NLT) <strong>Two:</strong> It leaves God in charge. He knows best: 'My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts.' (Isaiah 55:8 NLT) <strong>Three:</strong> It stops us worrying. God will provide for our needs. <strong>Four:</strong> It keeps us in check, keeps us forgiven and forgiving. <strong>Five:</strong> It protects us: the devil's got no chance against God. <strong>Six:</strong> It fills us full of God's hope: whatever's happening, God's got it sorted!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[The stream had become a river.' Ezekiel 47:5 CEV<br /><br />
<p>There's a book in the Bible named after a prophet called Ezekiel who saw visions-he imagined big things with God! His name means 'God strengthens' and he saw pictures from God. One vision was of a stream which became a river. A tiny trickle of water that was too shallow for paddling became a river so wide and deep it was necessary to swim it to get across. God wants you to be like Ezekiel with your thinking and imagination. Ephesians 3:20 GWT says: 'Glory belongs to God, whose power is at work in us. By this power He can do infinitely more than we can ask or imagine!'</p>
<p>This means if we're not thinking or imagining or asking for anything with God, we are cheating ourselves. You need to imagine big things and ask for big things if you want to see God do 'infinitely more than we can ask or imagine!' Joyce Meyer says, 'I'd rather ask God for a lot and get half of it than ask Him for a little and get all of it!' So start dreaming some wild dreams, imagining God doing massive, unbelievable, impossibly amazing stuff.</p>
<p>Start dreaming about the day you overcome the things you're struggling with: imagine God helping you conquer your addictions and fears. Ask God for what seems impossible: for the crime rate to come down where you live, for all forms of abuse happening in your town to end, for human trafficking worldwide to stop. Think BIG!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[do not...be anxious about tomorrow...' Matthew 6:34 AMP<br /><br />
<p>Jesus gives those of us who are worrywarts some very wise advice about the future: 'Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.' (Matthew 6:34 NIV)</p>
<p>Like a magnet, worry attracts the very things we fear, clouds our judgment and distorts our perspective. How do we stop it?</p>
<p>(1) Replace it: Do something else instead. The only way to break it is to replace it: '...whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things.' (Philippians 4:8 NIV)</p>
<p>(2) Dissect it: 'Fear involves torment.' (1 John 4:18 NKJ) Worry torments you; your imagination runs amok, conjuring up all kinds of scary scenarios. But pull it apart, dissect it-you see how illogical it is and it loses its power to control you.</p>
<p>(3) Rise above it: Worry is like being stuck in the clouds on a plane-you can't see anything-but when the plane ascends above the clouds you can see for hundreds of kilometres, it's all clear. When worry tries to fog you in, rise above, trust God: '...those who trust in the Lord...will soar...like eagles.' (Isaiah 40:31 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[...honour others more than you do yourself.' Romans 12:10 CEV<br /><br />
<p>We want the biggest piece of cake! We want to be picked for the team first! When we know the answer we want to be the first to say it! When we have an idea we want it to be used! We want to be told we're the best dressed, the funniest friend, the coolest, the smartest! We want to be noticed. 'It's all about me, me, me!'</p>
<p>God says, 'Honour others more than you do yourself.'</p>
<p>It's said that William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli were both great leaders. Gladstone was made Prime Minister of Great Britain four different times, the only person in history to achieve that honour. Disraeli served twice as Prime Minister. His greatest accomplishment was masterminding Britain's purchase of the Suez Canal. Both men accomplished a lot. <em>But what really separated them was their approach to people.</em> A young woman, who spent time with both men, was asked for her impression of each. She said, 'When I left the dining room after sitting next to Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But after sitting next to Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest woman in England.'</p>
<p>There's an important lesson here. Good leaders win the confidence, trust and friendship of people they lead by taking the spotlight off themselves and putting it on others. In fact, this principle will work for anybody. It's why God says: 'Honour others more than you do yourself.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[They...recognised them as men who had been with Jesus.' Acts 4:13 NLT<br /><br />
<p>It's easy to spot a true footy fan. They're not put off by anyone else's lack of interest in the sport. They wear their team's shirt with pride for everyone to see. They know when their team is playing and who the opposition is. They watch as many of the matches as they can. They sing the supporters' songs loudly and know the names of all the team and the coach. They stick by them, win or lose. Everyone around them knows they are a footy fan and can easily tell what team they support. They never try to hide it; in fact they don't shut up about it. Nothing can persuade them to do otherwise. Their words and actions say it all.</p>
<p>In Acts 4 we can read about Peter and John-they weren't footy followers but they had that sort of loyalty. Everything they did and said let everyone around them know, without question, that they were Christians. Even when they got locked up and threatened, they never gave up on Jesus, even when they were warned that 'they were on no account ever again to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.' But Peter and John spoke right back, '...we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.' (Acts 4:20 NIV)</p>
<p>What about you? Are you so sold-out for Jesus that everyone you meet knows by your words and actions Who you follow? Can they tell you're with Jesus?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[It is good and pleasant when God's people live together in peace!' Psalm 133:1 NCV<br /><br />
<p>Do you find that some people just get on your nerves? They totally do your head in! Even their breathing irritates you, and as for their ridiculous laugh and piercing personality-aargh! Just the sight of them is enough to spoil your day!</p>
<p>God says it is wonderful when brothers and sisters get along! And He's not just talking about your family here, but everyone in God's family. Yes, all that lot in church. In fact, Christians everywhere! Now it's easy to imagine how great life would be if indeed we did get along with everyone...but it's easier said than done, right? So how do we do what God is asking us to do?</p>
<p>First, stop focusing on the negative and concentrate on the positive: 'If people persecute you because you are a Christian, don't curse them; pray that God will bless them... Don't try to act important, but enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all! Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honourable... never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God. For it is written, &quot;I will take vengeance; I will repay those who deserve it,&quot; says the Lord.' (Romans 12:14-19 NLT)</p>
<p>Secondly, take responsibility for your own actions: 'Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe.' (Philippians 2:14-15 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[that Satan might not outwit us...' 2 Corinthians 2:11 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Satan called a worldwide convention of demons. He said, 'We can't keep Christians from going to church. We can't keep them from reading their Bibles and knowing the truth. We can't even keep them from forming an intimate relationship with their Saviour. Once they gain that connection with Jesus, our power over them is broken...</p>
<p>So let's steal their time, so they don't have time to develop a relationship with Jesus Christ... Tempt them... Over-stimulate their minds so that they cannot hear that still, small voice. Entice them to keep the TV, iPods and PCs going constantly in their home and see to it that every store and restaurant in the world constantly plays music with distracting lyrics. This will jam their minds and break that union with Christ. Give them Santa Claus to distract them from the real meaning of Christmas. Give them an Easter bunny so they won't talk about His resurrection and power over sin and death. Keep them too busy to go out in nature and reflect on God's creation... And when they meet for spiritual fellowship, involve them in gossip and small talk so that they leave with troubled consciences.'</p>
<p>It was quite a plan! The demons went eagerly, causing Christians everywhere to get more busy, going here and there, and having little time for God or their families, and no time to tell others about the power of Jesus to change lives. I guess the question is: has the devil been successful at his scheme? You be the judge! Does 'busy' mean: B-eing U-nder S-atan's Y-oke?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[God has arranged the parts...just as He wanted them...' 1 Corinthians 12:18 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Ads, magazines, billboards, TV: they tell us we're not thin enough, healthy enough, fit enough, tall enough, clever enough, rich enough, famous enough, talented enough! In short they tell us over and over that we're not good enough, but we could be if... we bought this, did that, went there! They can leave us feeling bottom of the heap, misfits, unacceptable, useless.</p>
<p>Listen to God instead. He made you, He knows all about you. Psalm 139:13-14 NLT tells us: 'You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!' Know that you matter.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us, '...we all share the same Spirit. Yes, the body has many different parts, not just one part... If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything? But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where He wants it... Yes, there are many parts, but only one body.' (1 Corinthians 12:13-20 NLT) We each have value just as we are and God has given us unique gifts and a special purpose so that the Body of Christ will function properly.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Examine yourselves...' 2 Corinthians 13:5 NKJ<br />When things go wrong, we have a natural instinct to blame everyone else. The 'it's-not-me-it's-them' syndrome kicks in. So that teacher at school you always seem to clash with is the one causing the problem, not you: 'They've just got it in for me, it's not fair!' Parents who give you a hard time are the ones causing all the trouble, not you: 'They just don't understand me, they need to lighten up!' Those friends you fell out with last week have got issues, not you: 'How dare they treat me like that!'<br />The Bible says, 'Examine yourselves.' God knows that it's so easy for us to do things our own way, not His way, and that we tend to blame other people when things go wrong.<br />Living the Christian life is not just about getting to know Jesus, but also about changing to become more like Him. Let go of the 'it's-not-me-it's-them' syndrome and let God handle your issues instead. Say goodbye to 'anger, bitterness, hate, impatience, greed-bad attitudes' and hello to God's 'love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control.' (Galatians 5:22-23 NLT)<br />Today, 'Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith.' (2 Corinthians 13:5 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Rev 1-4, Mark 10:13-22, Ps 117, Pr 12:20-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.' Genesis 12:3 NKJ<br />In order to bless all the families of the earth, Abraham had to start with his own family. After all, how could he be good news to the earth if he was bad news in his own home? Equally, if we want to sail the seven seas with the good news of Jesus, shouldn't we get it right in our own school, our own neighbourhood, our own home first?<br />For example, if we're a 24/7 walking mood machine with our own mums, how are we going to be with some hostile neighbours in a far flung desert land?<br />Matthew 25:23 NLT says this, 'You have been faithful in handling this small amount, so now I will give you many more responsibilities.' If you can be a blessing in your small beginnings, you can be trusted for greater blessings later. And there's no time like the present to start practicing.<br />So you want to be Billy Graham? Start by telling your mum what you learned at church this week. So you want to work with the street children of Mumbai? Start by babysitting for your next door neighbour's annoying kids. So you want to be a worship leader? Start by worshipping with your everyday living before picking up a guitar. Be faithful in the small and be faithful with the many. 'There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord.' (1 Corinthians 12:5 NLT)<br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 21-22, Mark 10:1-12, Ps 82, Pr 12:18-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...clothe yourselves...with the beauty that comes from within.' 1 Peter 3:4 NLT<br />Beauty isn't measured by the contours of your face or the smoothness of your skin. When it comes to beauty, get your viewfinder right: 'Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewellery, or beautiful clothes...clothe yourselves...with the beauty that comes from within.' (1 Peter 3:3-4 NLT)<br />There's a story about a top beauty company that asked customers to send a picture and a letter describing the most beautiful women they knew. One boy from a tough background wrote: 'A beautiful woman lives down the street from me. I visit her every day. She makes me feel like the most important kid in the world. We play board games and she listens to my problems. She understands me. When I leave she always yells out the door that she's proud of me.' The letter ended saying, 'This picture shows you that she is the most beautiful woman in the world, and one day I hope to have a wife as pretty as her.' The photograph wasn't some babe straight out of a commercial for hair shampoo, instead a toothless, grey-haired woman smiled from her wheelchair. The young boy clearly understood that beauty isn't found in a tub of cream or a can of hairspray.<br />Here's a beauty tip: trade in the amount of time you spend parading at beauty counters and preening in front of mirrors for doing something beautiful for your neighbour.<br />SoulFood: Ex 20:15, Ex 22:1-4, Pr 6:30-31, Luke 19:1-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<br />'...the leader should be like a servant.' Luke 22:26 NLT<br />You might not take too kindly to being told you should aim for the status of a dog. But if you stop and think about the beauty of a guide dog, it might become obvious why. Those loyal Labradors are trained for a single purpose: to serve a master. It's not as if Labs haven't anything better to do - they're happy enough lazing next to a sleepy fire or chasing a frisbee in the park or chewing the stuffing out of a sofa. But a Lab trained to serve the sightless puts all that aside. Alert at a traffic light or leading a safe path in the supermarket, they're always ready.<br />Guide dogs have been trained well to know their noble purpose-service. You are trained for a single purpose too: to serve the Master. Most world leaders are served by the poor; but our Bible tells us to flip this 180 degrees; the poor are to be served by us. 'If you help the poor, you are lending to the Lord-and He will repay you!' (Proverbs 19:17 NLT) Becoming great starts with the status of a dog-loyal to the Master.<br />National Day of Thanksgiving SoulFood: 1 Kings 18:16-20:43, Mark 9:38-50, Ps 113, Pr 12:15-17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Servant-hearted (2)<br />'Whoever wants to be a leader...must be your servant.' Matthew 20:26 NLT<br />The problem with the word 'servant' is that it conjures up images of downtrodden, poorly-paid domestic help, who scrub the underwear of lords and ladies for two cents an hour. Or our older brother forcing us to make him a cuppa, as we mutter under our breath, 'What did your last slave die of?'<br />'Servant' implies giving out for little thanks. 'Servant' implies hard work. Is Jesus therefore saying we need to become like badly-tipped waiters if we want to lead? Maybe our internal dictionaries need to get a new definition of 'servant'. Jesus, the Son of God, called Himself a servant: 'For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve...' (Mark 10:45 NLT)<br />One of the best examples of being a leader who serves is found at the Last Supper. Jesus knows this is His last meal before being crucified so it would be pretty understandable for Him to be wrapped up in His own problems. Yet Jesus isn't distracted by Himself, even under the most intense pressure imaginable. His attention stays focused on His team. His last evening is spent building others up with prayer and quality time. And when it comes to washing the roadside camel-dung off everyone's feet, it's not the hired help with towel and soapy water at hand - it's Jesus.<br />Christ-like leadership means the last shall be first and the first shall be last.<br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 16:1-18:15, Mark 9:30-37, Ps 108, Pr 12:14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to be a leader...must be your servant.' Matthew 20:26 NLT<br />You don't need captain's stripes or the seat closest to the front to be a leader. Leadership is as much a state of heart as it is a position. If you put others before yourself, then according to Jesus' thinking, you're a leader: 'Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.' (Matthew 20:26-28 NLT)<br />If you realise you're a team player, not the full enchilada, you're a leader. Jesus said, 'A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse.' (Mark 3:24 NLT) In other words, you can't sink someone else's end of the boat and keep your own afloat. Good leaders don't care who gets the credit. If you're so bad at stuff it brings you to your knees; you're a leader.<br />1 Corinthians 11:1 NLT says: '...you should imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.' When you're in way over your head and stuck for the next move, ask Jesus what to do. In Christ are all the answers and characteristics to imitate. When you're led by Christ, you'll find others following your lead. A real leader isn't found on a job bulletin board but in the faith and actions of the heart.<br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 14-15, Mark 9:14-29, Ps 101, Pr 12:12-13]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have played the fool...' 1 Samuel 26:21 NKJ<br />What do you want your last words to be? Something like: 'I leave my World Cup medals to my eldest, my Oscar to my youngest, and my Nobel Peace Prize to my darling in the middle...'<br />Whatever, chances are you've set your sights a little higher than King Saul who, towards the end of his life, said: 'I have played the fool...' (1 Samuel 26:21 NKJ) His words could so easily have been: 'I was a great king who was led by God to great things' but instead he played dumb when it came to obeying God. His life's turning point hinged on an attack by his enemies, the Philistines. In an attempt to get things moving, he cut corners by offering to God sacrifices that he was told should only be done by the prophet Samuel.<br />His disobedience was the start of a whole string of events that led to his defeat and death on a battlefield. Here's how to avoid playing the fool yourself:<br />(1) Don't put logic over loyalty. Saul rationalised, '...I saw my men scattering... you didn't arrive when you said... the Philistines are...ready for battle.' (1 Samuel 13:11 NLT) Listen to God first and trust Him-even if it doesn't make sense to you. He knows best!<br />(2) Don't put your feelings over faith. Saul was led by his gut reaction, 'I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering myself.' (1 Samuel 13:12 NLT) Note the words, 'I felt.' Some things can feel so right, yet be so wrong. Only trust your feelings when they line up with God's Word.<br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 12-13, Mark 9:1-13, Ps 128, Pr 12:10-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that your fruit should remain...' John 15:16 NKJ<br />When you're in the cemetery, every day is a lie-in day. So best use your God-given day while you've still got it! Life is short; eternity is long. You only get one chance at changing this planet and that's now. Elisha hooked onto this early. His beardy coach, Elijah, was approaching retirement, so he asked Elisha, 'What can I do for you?'<br />Now Elijah was a black-belt in miracles - he provided food for the poor, brought the dead back to life and had kings send for him. Elisha could have asked for wealth or position from Elijah. Instead he replied, 'Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit.' (2 Kings 2:9 NIV) The prophet understands that the only lasting legacy he can leave in this world is a spiritual one. What kind of spirit do you want to inherit: one that's rich in possessions but spiritually 'lite' or one that's light on possessions but rich with God?<br />Elisha chooses the double portion and gets it. Miracle man Elijah is recorded in the Bible at the hub of seven miracles. Elisha got double that with a whopping fourteen wonders next to his name. Thirteen of them Elisha saw with his own eyes. The final one occurred after he'd headed to Heaven - his dead bones brought someone back to life. Talk about leaving a legacy after you're gone!<br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 10-11, Mark 8:27-38, Ps 45, Pr 12:7-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...let us run with endurance the race that is set before us...' Hebrews 12:1 NKJ
<p>Quick but thick, Forrest Gump is a child-like guy who runs all over the planet for no reason. Early on in the film about him we see Forrest as a kid, running to and fro with big metal scaffolding strapped to his legs. The iron weights drag him down, so he can barely move. Then one day they fall off enabling Forrest to fly like the wind.</p>
<p>The writer of Hebrews describes something similar: '...lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and...run with endurance...' (Hebrews 12:1 NKJ) If we're going to fly like the wind for God, we need to have a bit of 'Forrest Gump' surgery.</p>
<p>Remember the three-legged race at school? Having your ankles tied to someone else's increased your chances of tumbling to the floor. It's the same with sin. Those little thoughts and habits tangle you up at your ankles, preventing you from flying for God.</p>
<p>Does God forgive you? Yes. Are you still saved? Yes. Are you getting the best out of life? No. Being a Christian is often compared to running a race. The better competitors keep in shape, train frequently and watch what they eat. If you want to stand out in the race you've got to keep your prayer life in shape. You must train yourself in the Word of God. You must watch what your heart and mind eat up.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife...' Ruth 4:13 NKJ<br /><br />
<p>Any  chick-flick worth its lipstick has plenty of twists and turns. 'Will  they/won't they?' is dragged out for a good eighty minutes of digital  drama and thirty minutes of soundtrack. Magically, with two minutes to  spare to the next showing, all plotlines are neatly tied together and,  hey presto, a theme song about 'love' floats over scenes of cuddling in  the sunset.</p>
<p>Often when it comes to fulfilling promises in our lives, God allows  the 'will it/won't it' bit to happen for a good chunk of our story. Just  when you think it won't, He takes two minutes to wrap up all the loose  ends. Suddenly, hey presto, promise fulfilled.</p>
<p>Naomi teaches the importance of timing: 'Do not make yourself known  to the man until...' (Ruth 3:3 NKJ) Ruth had waited a long time for this  moment; now she had to learn to be patient because, although God wanted  to bless her through Boaz, he was sleeping. It's hard to be all keyed  up about something nobody else is excited about; you want them to be  excited too. But sometimes God says, 'Wait.' We need to stop trying to  make things happen before their time. 'The vision is yet for an  appointed time...wait for it; because it will surely come.' (Habakkuk  2:3 NKJ) God may not respond when you think He should, but He will move  before the end credits.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife...' Ruth 4:13 NKJ
<p>Before the mushy scenes of kissing in the rain and holding hands on a beach, our <em>Ruth</em> movie must have the obligatory 'girly pampering' sequence. That's where our leading lady turns from geek to glamour (usually by removing a pair of specs and shaking out the bun in her hair). Best buddy Naomi tells Ruth to 'anoint' herself (Ruth 3:3).</p>
<p>In OT times, this meant more than a splash of perfume and a liberal spray of deodorant. Anointing was a sign of refreshment and renewal. Ruth wasn't getting ready for a hot date-she was getting prepared for the next significant part of her story. Do you feel on the threshold of something big and new? Take a leaf out of Ruth's book; refresh your attitude; renew your hope; anoint yourself for change.</p>
<p>Once Ruth is freshened up, our next shot sees her striding out in the perfect dress and accessories. Naomi had told her, 'put on your best garment.' (Ruth 3:3 NKJ) After all, if you want heads to turn, you've got to be dressed for success. Ditto; if you're going to turn heads to God, you've got to look the part. No, that doesn't mean splashing out on the most expensive designer clothes you can afford; it simply means getting in good Christian shape. Once we're wearing love, joy and compassion, The Director can cue lots of historic scenes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife...' Ruth 4:13 NKJ<br /><br />When it comes to our own story, we can often be in a mad sprint to cross the finish line marked 'and they all lived happily ever after'. The important stuff, though, is the bit just before then-the best lessons lie somewhere between 'once upon a time...' and the closing credits.
<p>If the book of Ruth were to be turned into a romantic chick-flick, the script would be geared towards Ruth and Boaz smooching as the credits roll. However the really interesting part for the audience would be how they arrived at that moment.</p>
<p>Our first pivotal point would be how our characters meet. Ruth isn't looking for just any guy; she has her sights set on one specific hunk. Her buddy Naomi (these films always have a meddling buddy, right?) has done the boyfriend research thing: 'he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.' (Ruth 3:2 NKJ)</p>
<p>Our first lesson of the story can be spotted here: when you want something, you've got to keep your eyes peeled for an opportune time. It's the same with prayer-do your research and keep your eyes open to what God is doing. If it's God's will, an opportunity will rise for the taking. Part of Ruth's movie is about recognising God's specific plans. Ultimately, that's your movie too: acting the leading role in a plot-line written for the Kingdom's 'happily ever after'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[Therefore go and make disciples...' Matthew 28:19 NIV<br />
<p>Very few of us have an anointing to teach and preach to large crowds, but that doesn't mean the rest of us can leave it all to the big-stage brigade. Unless your copy of the Bible came equipped with a personal exemption note from Jesus Himself, the Great Commission includes you.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you are the best 'Billy Graham' God could possibly put into your friends and family's lives. No, you don't need to carry a microphone or a portable stadium around with you-you just need to carry a few Jesus Principles in your heart.</p>
<p><em>Principle one: Friends not</em> <em>converts</em>. Jesus had a packed social calendar. He hung out at parties and dinners because he saw people as friends not converts. We need to love our mates, not see them merely as potential pew-fillers.</p>
<p><em>Principle two: Buddies not bores</em>. Banging on about the Bible with every breath will make you a God-bore. The best way to love someone might be a whole lot simpler than ramming the whole New Testament down their throat. A regular call, email or Facebook encouraging message might not seem like evangelism but loving people for who they are is definitely Jesus territory<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Principle three:</em> <em>Pray don't push</em>. It's not your job to 'save' anyone. Salvation is God's business. Telling someone you're praying for them while they face a tough situation might really touch them but sensitivity is obviously the key.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A spiritual gift is given to each of us...' 1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT<br />
<p>Yeah, so the brainy set may be able to finish the whole Maths exam in the time it takes you to fill in your name at the top of the paper. In Art, they might be imitating the brushstrokes of Picasso whilst you're concentrating on colouring inside of the lines. Or they might already be showering off from a brisk cross-country run while you're still tripping over your shoelaces at the start line.</p>
<p>True success is not measured against the achievements of others. No matter what you do, there'll always be a Stephen Hawking or a Usain Bolt, someone who is better than you. Success is more accurately measured in terms of God's purposes for your life. What has God assigned you, personally, to do? 'A spiritual gift is given to each of us as a means of helping the entire church.' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT)</p>
<p>Jesus said He was successful because He accomplished the work His Father had sent Him to do (see John 17:4). And Paul could say at the end of his life, 'I have finished my course...' (2 Timothy 4:7 KJV) By this standard, success may mean putting dreams of chasing fame and fortune on the backburner. It's being prepared to remain unknown and anonymous to the majority of the world but being famous in the eyes of God. Autographs and mansions are all very well, but they can't take the place of divine purpose.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Having gifts...let us use them.' Romans 12:6 NKJ<br />
<p>In high school, 'Sparky' flunked Latin, Algebra, English and Physics. He made the golf team but promptly lost his only match of the season...then he lost the consolation match. He was awkward socially-more shy than disliked. He never once asked a girl out on a date in high school.</p>
<p>One thing, however, was important to Sparky-drawing. He was proud of his artwork even though nobody else appreciated it. He submitted cartoons to the editors of his high school yearbook but they were rejected. Even so, he aspired to be an artist. After high school he sent samples of his work to The Walt Disney Studios. Again he was rejected. But Sparky didn't quit. He decided to write his autobiography in cartoons. The popularity of his cartoon strip eventually led to countless books and television shows.</p>
<p>You see, Sparky was Charles Schulz, creator of the <em>Peanuts</em> comic strip, the most famous cartoonist of all time. Like his main character, Charlie Brown, Schulz seemed unable to succeed at many things. But he made the most of his God-given talent, refused to quit, and ended up winning. God has 'graced' you to do certain things well. Work out what you're good at, practice it well, and be determined to serve God with your future.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.' Proverbs 11:13 NKJ<br />
<p><em>Embarrassing Bodies</em> is a strange piece of television. The programme works on the premise that Antony from Newcastle is too embarrassed to show his wobbly flesh to his local GP but will happily parade it in front of a million viewers. Hasn't Antony worked out that the man with the camera is betraying his confidence?</p>
<p>Sometimes we carry the <em>Embarrassing Bodies</em> syndrome around with us. A mate comes to us with a bit of a sensitive issue but instead of providing a warm shoulder to cry on, we broadcast it like that man with the camera.</p>
<p>Proverbs 11:13 NKJ says, 'A talebearer reveals secrets, but he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.' There's a severe shortage of people who can keep their lips zipped but the ones who can, live by these ground rules:</p>
<p>(1) Talk is cheap unless it's prayer. Instead of chin-wagging the juicy stuff on your free minutes, take the sensitive issue to God and hold your mate up in prayer. (2) Judge not. Who needs to hear your take-of-the-story anyway? Your friend doesn't need you going all Judge Judy on her. She just wants someone who'll listen. (3) Be aware. God promises how you handle others determines how He handles you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...wisdom is better than strength...' Ecclesiastes 9:16 NKJ<br />
<p>Shampoo companies say: 'Because <em>you're</em> worth it.' Careers advisors say: '<em>You</em> are in the driving seat.' Even clothes on shop hangers seem to scream: '<em>You</em> can be who <em>you</em> want to be (if you just buy me).' A lot of our world is geared to getting us thinking about ourselves. We're a self-absorbed, self-important race of people. Wisdom says: 'Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.' (Philippians 2:4 NLT)</p>
<p>The difference between a child and a grown-up isn't whether you watch <em>Play School</em> or not, it's how you think of others. A child can happily bully others into his own way but a grown-up thinks of others' needs as well as their own. Childish Christians treat God like the tooth fairy: 'What little present might He leave under my pillow tonight?' Prayer for them is like a shopping catalogue-page after page of stuff to bring them happiness. And church is like a musicfest-they hope their favourite songs are played.</p>
<p>Childish Christians play with God for their own purposes. Grown-up Christians get smart; they wake up expecting God to work through them in fresh ways. They make the 'me-first' mental shift to 'God-first'-praying like Paul, 'I don't think about what would be good for me but what would be good for many people so that they might be saved.' (1 Corinthians 10:33 GWT)</p>

<p>You can find out yesterday's top temperature in Los Angeles at the click of a mouse. You can find out the record for the longest three-legged distance run at the flick of a page. You can even find out what went through Alexander the Great's mind by watching a film. One thing you'll never learn from Google, the Guinness Book of Records or your local cinema, though, is wisdom.</p>
<p>...do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding? It is hidden from the eyes of all humanity.' (Job 28:20-21 NLT) Knowledge is easily accessible but wisdom is hard to pin down-unless you actively pursue it. When you know God, you know where to find it. You're never lost with a prayer at your disposal: 'If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and He will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.' (James 1:5 NLT)</p>
<p>You're never stuck if you turn to the most reliable source of wisdom, the Bible: 'The instructions of the Lord are perfect, reviving the soul. The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.' (Psalm 19:7 NLT) And you're never in a muddle with the Holy Spirit: 'Who can know the Lord's thoughts? Who knows enough to teach Him? But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ.' (1 Corinthians 2:16 NLT)</p>

<p>It's not that some people are brainy, it's just they know how to pass exams. Ask them if they understand the difference between 'Photosynthesis' and 'Photoshop' and lots of them will be left scratching the fluff on their chins. And yet they could probably still pass high school Science because they learned the right bite-size chunks to quote on a test paper.</p>
<p>Knowledge and wisdom are not the same. Having a head full of facts and quotes may come in handy for <em>Millionaire Hotseat</em> but it won't help you come to grips with life. Knowledge gives the correct answer; wisdom gives insight.</p>
<p>So when a best friend tells you she's thinking about sleeping with the college Romeo, a knowledge of human biology says there's a high probability she'll be left with an infection or a pregnancy. Wisdom says there's a high emotional price to be paid for this intimate relationship and she'll be left feeling used, hurt and regretful. Knowledge can quote relevant verses regarding sex outside of marriage. Wisdom understands the verses are there for <em>our</em> benefit. Knowledge says the verses must still be relevant. Wisdom knows people haven't changed and God, the designer of sex and marriage, still knows best and wants the best for <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>With wisdom, it's not what you know but Who you know.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they...searched the Scriptures daily...' Acts 17:11 NKJ<br />
<p>Guys, if you want to impress a girl, just pretend to be the romantic, sensitive type: 'Love is like the wild rose-briar...' You can't beat a bit of Emily Bronte, can you, girls?</p>
<p>Or girls, if you want to make a guy go weak at the knees, say stuff like: 'If Darth Vader had a fight with Rocky Balboa-who'd win?'</p>
<p>Actually, learning one line of poetry doesn't make you the perfect romantic; nor does knowing a few movies make you the dream girlfriend. Equally, paying lip service to God's Word without acting on it will not grow you in God. Anybody can learn a clever sentence or rattle off John 3:16 to sound holy. However, making a noise <em>like</em> a Christian and standing out from the crowd acting <em>as</em> a Christian are two different things.</p>
<p>The book of Acts says that the early Christians searched the Scriptures daily. What if they'd all had good intentions to read their Bibles but never quite got around to it? How would the apostles have got on then? Stephen would have been lost for words in Acts 7; Peter's heroic talks to the crowds would've fallen flat, and Paul's letters to the churches would've been at best cute penpal letters. These guys left a legacy that still stands today because they knew their Scriptures inside out. They lived out their Bible. How long have you been <em>talking</em> about reading your Bible?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it is in your power to act.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 3:27 NIV</span><br>Ever had this experience? Your excited about being a Christian and living for God when, WHAM! The warm fuzzy feelings suddenly fizzle. That's not bad or wrong. Feelings come and go all the time. What's bad is when we let those 'can't be bothered' feelings keep us from doing what is right. That's called apathy and God hates it (Isaiah 32:9; Amos 6:1). Apathy is one step away from a proper bad attitude, it always ends up destructive not productive. When a bad attitude infects our brains it spoils all the fun and poisons friendships. Somehow, even though it's not what you wanted you find yourself in a slangin' match with your best friend. The hurtful words are coming out your mouth faster than you can think to stop them. When did you stop caring about their feelings? Answer; when apathy arrived. 
The key to overcoming apathy is not by trying to crank up a bunch of ooey-gooey feelings. You need to say sorry and then start doing the things you did at first. That means doing these three things today and every day:
1) Talk to God in prayer (Ephesians 6:18) 
2) Listen to God by reading The Bible (Acts 20:32)  
3) Show love by helping others. This is why God says, 'Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help them'.  God doesn't want you to become a-pathetic. So don't go there!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...you planned evil against me but God used those same plans for my good...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 50:20 TM</span><br>Yesterday we faced up to the reality that life can be painful, that things in our lives can go horribly wrong. It did for Joseph (read Genesis 37 - 50)! At first you think, will anything ever go right for this poor guy? He gets laughed at, bullied, beat up and left for dead by his brothers before they decide to sell him. As a result he has to live in Egypt as a slave, his boss's wife tells lies about him and he's thrown into prison, where he's forgotten about! Nothing's gone well and it's not even his fault. What's going on?
At the end of his life, this is what Joseph says to his brothers, 'You planned evil against me but God used those same plans for my good'. Rather than get angry, bitter and plot revenge, Joseph put his trust in God. No matter what was happening, Joseph kept on living for God. Later, he recognized how God had worked in His life all along. God used all the mess to enable him to save the lives of thousands, including the lives of his family. He had no reason to be angry but every reason to be thankful. 
Romans 8:28 NAS says, 'And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God...' Remember today that no disaster, disease or delay is beyond God turning it into something good.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 2:23 NIV</span><br>In the short time it takes you to read this, thousands of people will suffer. Death, disaster, disease, loss, trouble, violence, hardship, tragedy, failure are some of the harsh realities of life. They bring with them, grief, heartache, depression, agony, disappointment, sorrow, sadness, pain, misery. The Bible tells us that people on this earth, will always suffer, because of sin. Even Jesus said, 'In this world you will have trouble' (John 16:33 NIV). So the question we should be asking is not, 'will I suffer?', but 'how will I deal with suffering?'
Look what the Israelites did, 'they cried out (to God) for help'. In Exodus 3 we discover that when God's people are hurting: He sees, He Hears, He cares; and He acts.  For years the Israelites had been held as slaves in Egypt and God promised to set them free (Genesis 15:16, 46:3-4). They had to wait a long time for that promise to be kept. God rescued them when He knew the time was right. God's rescue doesn't always come the moment we want it. 
If you're suffering today, remember that even though God has a different time schedule; He sees, He Hears, He really does cares; and He will act. Do you know someone who is suffering? Ask God to show you how He could use you to help them. God used Moses to set the people free from slavery. God will use you too.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:2 NIV</span><br>Get this; God doesn't get tired! (Psalm 121:4) So what's He doing taking a rest then eh? Could it be that rest isn't just about stopping when you're tired to 'recharge your batteries'? Could it be that God is telling us something important? When God rested, He was telling us we need to rest too! So how exactly did God do it? 
1) He rested after he had worked; sorry if you were thinking 'YAY I can rest all the time God says!'  We too need to work first and then rest!  
2) He worked 6/7 of the week and rested 1/7; when we come back from holiday, we can want to stay in 'holiday mode', and start dreaming of holidaying all year round. But God's way for our lives is about getting the right balance.  
3) He blessed His rest time; He set it apart as something different. He gave a rule to live by (commandment 4 in Exodus 20) that our rest must be a priority, something special, different than any other day.  
4) He used it to look back on all His work; we too need to regularly look back at what we've been doing and how we've been living, to avoid making the same mistakes. 
God was able to look back and call everything 'very good.' Can you look back on your last week and say the same? Take time to chill!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ecclesiastes 12:13 NIV</span><br>If anyone ever 'had it all' Solomon did. Knowledge, power, and the biggest bank account ever! On top of that his house was full of 100's of beautiful women, plus he was a famous writer, a connoisseur of fine wines and his dinner parties resembled 'lifestyles of the rich and famous'. In his spare time he built magnificent palaces, gardens and parks! But here's the amazing thing: Solomon never found fulfilment in his unlimited possessions, power or pleasure (and he really did try... read Ecclesiastes and see for yourself!). That's why he made this statement near the end of his life, 'Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.'
So there you have it. Solomon, one of the most powerful and people who ever lived - saying, &quot;Take it from a guy who's tried it all: This world, despite all its glitz and glamour, cannot fill the empty place in your soul. Only a relationship with God will satisfy your deepest longings'. So, what about you? Have you found the ultimate fulfilment that only Jesus Christ can bring? Open your heart to Him. Ask Him to forgive your sins and fill you with His life and love. Then spend your days getting to know Him. That's the smartest move you can ever make. And that's the way to true riches.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...thank God no matter what happens. This is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Thessalonians 5:18 TM</span><br>'Carpe diem', that's Latin for 'seize the day'. It means live for today, not tomorrow. We can often spend today looking forward to tomorrow. We decide we don't like the now, so daydream about the later. We find ourselves saying things like: 'I can't wait till the weekend', or 'things will be so great when I finally leave school.' Or 'once I get my license, my life will be perfect!' We focus on the future. If we always live like this - thinking mainly about tomorrow - we'll never be satisfied, because tomorrow never comes does it? 
When things go wrong, we often look ahead to better days; try to avoid what's happening now. There's a problem with this futuristic obsession: It shields us from what really is (reality) by filling our minds with what might be (fantasy). The result is sad; we miss out on life, because we never stop to think about what's happening now! God doesn't want you to miss out, which is why he says, Give thanks all the time, 'no matter what is happening'. When you do this you recognise that every moment of every day He is there with you. Nothing is outside His understanding. When life is sad or difficult, taking time to thank God you realise He is there protecting you, loving you, encouraging you, supporting you. If you're always looking ahead you'll miss out on knowing Him. So seize the day; give thanks!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Observe people who are good at their work- skilled workers are always in demand and admired; they don't take a backseat to anyone.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 22:29 TM</span><br>On a list of your favourite words, responsibility is probably propping up the bottom along with exam and dentist.  But think how life would be without any responsibilities. Your parents wouldn't have to provide you with a home, there would be no laws against anything at all, you couldn't do anything that involves working together; so no team sports. It's absolutely right to be thankful that God has created you to be responsible, hard working and skilled at what you do best. 
Some people think that work, taking responsibility, is something that came after Adam and Eve got chucked out of the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). Because they messed up, sin entered the world and so now we have to work. Gutted! But this isn't true; God actually designed us to work and be good and skilled at what we do right from the start. God put Adam in the Garden '...to work and take care of it' (Genesis 2:15). He wasn't expecting Adam to make a naff job of it either! He 'put him in charge'. More importantly we know that God Himself works and rests (John 5:17, Genesis 2:2-3) so there is no way we can excuse ourselves. Work is one of our God-given responsibilities.
Every day has 24 hours filled with opportunities to serve and to become better at what you do. So don't be scared of the 'R' word!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 15:4 NIV</span><br>Maybe the toughest decisions you face during your teenage years are the ones involving your personal values eg what principles will you live you life by? Childhood means everybody else tells you what to think and how to act. Adulthood means it's your call. Will you take on board the ideals of your parents? That might be a good thing; or it might not! Will you launch out on our own? No-one can live your life for you. You have to decide.
Values aren't just something we think about but stuff we do. Our values cause us to act in a certain way. God unpacks many values in the Bible, teaching us how He wants us to live. Here's just one of them: 'The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.' Do you ever think from one day to the next about the words you create with your tongue? Do you want your voice to be a voice of healing or a voice of destruction? The answer might seem obvious to you now but would it be obvious to someone on the receiving end of one of your rants!  
Don't just think about this verse today. Take some time to write down the values you have about family, money, sex, relationships, friendships, education, work, church. Do your values match what God says? Listen to God's values and live them!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 10:4 NIV</span><br>Years ago a farmer on the Atlantic coast found it really difficult to find workers. No-one wanted to work for him because of the dreadful storms that hit the area. The farmer interviewed yet another man, 'Are you a good farmhand?' This man replied, 'Well, I can sleep when the wind blows.' The farmer didn't understand his answer, but was so desperate for workers, offered him the job. To his astonishment the guy accepted and worked really well. Then one night the farmer woke up to the sound of the wind howling. He jumped out of bed and went to the farmhand's room, 'Get up, Get up! A storms coming, tie things down before they blow away'. The man rolled over and firmly said, 'No Sir! I told you I can sleep when the wind blows.' Enraged the farmer ran out to see to the farm without his help. To his amazement he discovered that all the haystacks had been covered, all the animals where locked away safely, everything was tied down, nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired farmhand had meant, and he returned to bed, to also sleep whilst the wind blew.
When you work hard you are prepared and have nothing to fear. Work hard at reading your Bible. Then whatever life throws your way, you can 'sleep when the wind blows' too. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The wicked man earns deceptive wages, but he who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 11:18 NIV</span><br>A man asked for a member of his family to be left unmentioned in a book that was being written about his family history. The reason was that he wanted to hide the awful truth that this relative had been sentenced to death by electric chair for committing murder. 'No need to do that', said the biographer. 'I can report the situation in such a way that there will be no embarrassment to you. I'll just write that his death came as a real shock.' OK, sick joke alert! But seriously, the Bible teaches us that once we've died, there's nothing else that can be done in order to get us ready to meet God (Hebrews 9:27). It won't matter what people write about you or say about you to make you look good. God knows all about you, and you will be judged by Him.
Life can seem so unfair sometimes; some people get away all sorts of bad stuff, others make lots of money from doing wrong things, innocent people suffer. But remember, ultimately God is in control, He will be the judge, and the rewards some dodgy people appear to be getting for doing wrong, God promises, won't last long. 'Evil people get rich for the moment, but the reward of the godly will last.' Concentrate on being the best you can be and let God be the judge of others.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 6:6 NLT</span><br>Lots of peoplel have dreams about being a superhero like Batman or Spiderman or maybe even the Incredible Hulk! But what about Antman (or Antwoman!)? How does that sound? Yes, Ants, those pesky little things that make us feel seriously grossed out if we find one nibbling on our jam tart in the kitchen! We instinctively want to squash them if we see them; we don't much care for them being around do we? But God says learn from them. He is thinking about the superhero Antman! Now before you get carried away designing your superhero outfit, listen to what God wants you to learn (proverbs 6:6-8).
1) The ant works hard: No-one has to tell the ant what to do. They have no Boss telling them, but they see the need and get on with their job.  2) The ant prepares for the future: They don't just live for today, but make plans for the year ahead. 3) The ant is focused: The ant knows what it should do, it has purpose.
God wants you to live the same: a) to work hard, not because some teacher or boss or parent is breathing down your neck, but because you want to b) to plan for the future, not just living in the moment, but thinking about where you're going c) to be focused, determined to live your life being all God intended you to be.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Slack habits and sloppy work are as bad as vandalism.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 18:9 TM</span><br>Ok so we all like to sit in front of the TV sometimes, or turn off the alarm and go back to sleep. We don't always do things when we should, 'I'll do it later!' we say. Does that make you lazy? The Bible's very clear that being lazy is as bad as vandalizing. Laziness is destructive! So we don't want to fall into that trap! Do we? (The answer is no - you don't!) So let's have a lazy checklist, so we can stop ourselves from hitting the destruct button by falling into the laziness trap.
L is for Lame: Lame excuses that you make up for not doing things! A is for Always: Always being the one other people have to clean up after! Z is for ZZzzz: ZZzzz - Are you spending far too many mornings having another lie-in? Y is for YoYo: YoYo describes your emotions that bounce up and down all the time - and when your down nothing at all gets done because you 'just don't feel like it!' 
So does that sound anything like you? Are you L-A-Z-Y? Make a change today or these lazy habits and attitudes will become become a way of life, which means you're headed for a life of destruction. God wants you to value yourself far more than this. He sees your potential. You can do it. From today let's agree lazy days are over! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.' </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ecclesiastes 2:21 NIV</span><br>We're often told to 'build a good life for ourselves'; to 'look out for number one'. to get good qualifications, a good career, a house, a car, get married, have kids, have holidays abroad, nice clothes, lots of money. But at the end of the day, we're all going to die and then what? What was the point of living like that? It all seems pretty pointless don't you think? 
Jesus warns us against living such pointless lives, &quot; Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&quot; (Matthew 6: 19-21 NIV)
God doesn't want us to build our lives getting things that we can't take to heaven with us, or doing things that will mean nothing in heaven. He doesn't want you to live a pointless life. So when you're thinking about what to do with your time, your money, your life. Ask yourself this, will it make a difference in the light of eternity?
You only have one life to invest in the eternity to come. Don't not miss the opportunity. Today make sure that what will be most important to you five minutes after you die, become the most important to you now. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 26:12 NKJV</span><br>Sometimes what God asks us to do, can seem totally ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous! Are you up for that? Isaac was; he was well up for whatever God asked of him.  Then he was in a land that was suffering from famine and God told him to stay put. Sensible people don't spend months doing the back-breaking job of planting seeds in a land where there's very little water. Not only is it bad for business, but you and your family are likely to die in the process!  Even so, Isaac chooses to obey God, and God kept His promise and business was booming!
Unfortunately this just made the guys living around Isaac (the Philistines) mad with jealousy and they deliberately started to trash all Isaac's hard work. He could have fought back, big time. They were breaking the law! But he chose to be patient, he followed God's way, and as a result he got a bumper harvest and the people were able to live together in peace. What seemed ridiculous turned out better than ever!
We too can find ourselves in situations where it's so hard to give when you have so little, or so hard to be patient with people who are deliberately causing you trouble. Remember God's way won in Isaacs's life, so God's way will win in your life too. Are you up for the absolutely ridiculous today?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:4 NIV</span><br>A couple of weeks ago we were looking into what Jesus really meant when he called people 'hypocrites'. We found out that it was all to do with the ancient Greeks and their love of acting and theatre. Let's have another look at this today because there's more for us to discover... In Matthews Gospel Jesus actually mentions four types of Hypocrites: 
1) The Poser;the Christian who makes themselves 'look good' by acting like they care about others when really they couldn't give a stuff 
2) The Pusher; the Christian who pushes other people into doing what they don't do themselves 
3) The Preventer; the Christian who is so obsessed with their own petty issues that they stop other people from experiencing God 
4) The Preoccupied: the Christian who is more bothered about how they look on the outside than who they are inside.
So what's all this got to do with today's verse? Well Jesus is letting us know that He wants us to help anyone and everyone around us who's in need, anyway that we can, BUT, with the right motive! He doesn't want you to put on an act and do things to make yourself look good, that's being a hypocrite! Do it because you love Jesus and want to be more like Him. Then you'll find God smiling over you, saying 'that's my kid!' And get this....He'll give you a reward EVERYTIME!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 11:29 NIV</span><br>Sometimes teachers get it wrong: The famous French sculptor Rodin was described by teachers as, 'the worst pupil in the school!' Albert Einstein's teacher described him as &quot;mentally slow, unsociable and adrift forever in his foolish dreams.&quot; He was expelled! Thomas Edison, the guy who invented the light bulb had a teacher who said, 'he was too stupid to learn anything!' The famous opera singer Enrico's teacher said, 'he had no voice at all and could not sing!' Beethoven's teacher called him 'hopeless' as a composer.
Miss Phillips, a teacher of Peter J Daniel, constantly said, &quot;Peter. J. Daniel you're no good, you're a bad apple and you're never going to amount to anything.&quot; Peter was totally illiterate until he was 26. Now he owns the street corners he used to fight on and published a book: Miss Phillips, You Were Wrong!
Jesus is the greatest teacher of all, He never gets it wrong! He knows everything about you, He sees your potential, He never listens to what others say about you, He knows you! Today He is saying, 'Hang out with Me, learn from Me! I'll show you how to get the best out of your life. Don't try and work things out on your own, don't try so hard! Walk with Me, work with Me; watch how I do it. Keep company with Me and I'll teach you the best way to live life!&quot;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I pray...that your heart may be enlightened...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:18 NIV</span><br>Imagine - you're having the worst day ever. Your best mate's been killed, and to top it all his body's been nicked from the grave. You're walking along with a mate, wallowing in your sadness, when some bloke comes along and starts chatting. Most people would probably want to tell him to get lost and leave them alone - even if he was trying to be helpful! 
That's probably what the disciples were thinking in Luke 24:15 - 16. But how glad to you think they were that they didn't ignore the guy walking by them, when they found out it actually was Jesus! They'd been so focused on how bad they were feeling, they'd not even realized it was Him! When the disciples did actually look to Jesus, and recognize him, suddenly things changed. They went from fear to courage, pain to joy, despair to hope - all because they'd got back their focus on Jesus. And that is the story of Easter - no matter how bad things may seem to be, how bad your day is going, when you fix your eyes on Jesus and focus on Him, He'll fill you with hope. Don't be so focused on what's going on that you lose sight of what matters - Jesus.
That's why Paul writes ' I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called' (Ephesians 1:18 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...He has given us...a living hope...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 1:3 NIV</span><br>They'd seen him dead. Dead as a corpse can be; white, cold, without breath, without life; and now, here they are, stood in an empty tomb, with two strangers saying, 'Why do you look for the living among the dead?'.  What kind of sick joke was this? Jesus deserved better than this. They couldn't leave Him alone when He was alive, and now, they're still at it, when He's dead. Unless....unless...something miraculous did happen that Sunday morning two thousand years ago. What if God really did have a masterplan? What if Jesus was who they said He was? What if human kind was about to win history's jackpot; reassurance of life after death. Easter Sunday is the celebration that Jesus was and is raised from the dead, and that here was the beginning of a new world which we can start to share in now. As we experience Jesus' risen life, hopefully it will rub off on others. Hopefully today of all days, we can see the life that Jesus is bringing to dead places and dead situations. We are all asked, 'why do you look for the living among the dead?' Only this time, we can answer, 'because we have seen the living One in our life, we want to see the living One bring life to the dead hopes and lives of those placed around us'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...He has given us...a living hope...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 1:3 NIV</span><br>It's a bit of a funny old day, Easter Saturday. The worst day, actually, because it's the only day, when in the Christian story, Jesus is not alive. Where did he go for those 24 hours before his great come-back? Well, we discover today that what frightens us most, death, is another place that Jesus has been before us. We're not alone, he understands, He's already been there!
We try to out-think death by putting our faith in medicine and science, with all its advances. We get fit, we eat right, we look after ourselves, and still death, eventually, despite all our efforts, catches us eventually.  But get this: there is nothing to fear. You see, the Man beaten to a pulp by the strongest of soldiers. The Man whipped, flogged and paraded through town. The Man hung on a cross dying the worst, agonizing death ever; well, by Sunday He's back! He's looked death square in the eye and come back with the greatest story ever told; resurrection. And what's more, He invites us into the tale, saying we can do the same, if we just have a little faith. If you've ever wondered if there is anything after we die, here's the evidence. That's what the Saturday can become all about; facing death, knowing it is not the end, but that resurrection is round the corner.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...God...reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 5:18 NKJV</span><br>We see the golden arches of McDonald's and we think 'Big Mac'. We see a swoosh on a pair of trainers and think 'Nike': but what about the cross? What does that symbolize? A bling item we hang round our necks? A religious shape hung outside a church? Or a death penalty of its day?
How can we make sense of this picture of Jesus hanging from a death penalty? Firstly, we now know where God is to be found; He's on a cross. When we face raw suffering in a hurting world and we ask that million dollar question, 'where is God in all of this?' or our soul cries, 'where is God when I need  Him most' the answer is hanging from the cross. Hanging from that same pain we are feeling. 
Secondly, we see a crucified God who takes responsibility for our mess. An exchange is made as the ultimate price is paid for our ransom; blood money. In order to be restored to the Father, the Son stretches His arms across a large cross-beam, and we are able to walk across this bridge into the Father's arms. 
Thirdly, we see God is staying with us to the very end of our wounded road. A miraculous exchange brings about change as we are released to grow into our God destinies. Thank Jesus today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I have learned the secret of being content...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:12 NIV</span><br>Michael Drosnin wrote a book about a man who wanted more. More wealth, so he built a huge financial empire. More pleasure, so he paid for the best women money could buy. More adventure, so he set air speed records, built and piloted the world's most unique aircraft. More power, so he got political clout that was the envy of senators. More glamour, so he owned film studios and hung out with stars. Drosnin tells how this man's life ended: 'He was a figure of ... power, ready for the grave. Emaciated ... thin scraggly beard ...  sunken chest, hideously long fingernails in grotesque yellow corkscrews ... Many of his teeth were black, rotting stumps. A tumour was beginning to emerge from the side of his head...there were innumerable needle marks. Howard Hughes was an addict. A billionaire junkie.' All that, and he still wasn't content. So here's the question: If he'd pulled off another deal, made another million and tasted another thrill, would it have been enough? No. We think we'll be more grateful if we get more, but it's not always the case.
The same man who wrote, 'I have learned the secret of being content' also wrote, 'In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you' (1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV). You cannot make yourself a more grateful or content person, but you can pray for it and open your heart to what God will do. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I have learned the secret of being content...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:12 NIV</span><br>So, what's the secret of being content? Here are three things that may help you on your way... 
1) Learn to be happy with less. Happiness isn't about getting what you want, but about enjoying what God's given you. Make a list of good things in your life, and thank God for them today. Paul said he had learned to be content, 'Whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength.' 
2) Remind yourself things could be worse. Snoopy was lying in his kennel one Thanksgiving Day, mumbling about being stuck with dog food while all those humans got to be inside with the turkey and gravy and pumpkin pie. 'Of course, it could have been worse,' he finally reflected, 'I could have been born a turkey.' Reminding yourself 'It could be worse' can really help you to develop contentment. 
3) Know that you're going for spiritual contentment, not just stuff. We may want more stuff, but underneath that is what we really want; God, the perfection of heaven - and that's to come. You're unlikely to feel totally content, as this world isn't your ultimate home; heaven is. 
Today, try flipping your discontent on its head, and using it to pray 'Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Matthew 6:10 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 2:14 NIV</span><br>Pastor Jon Walker writes: 'Spirit warnings alert you to impending danger. A friend of mine was driving towards a green light when he was strongly prompted to hit his brakes. As he did so a truck ran a red light. Had it not been for my friend's instant obedience he'd probably have been killed. Spirit 'stop signs' red-flag you not to go somewhere. A dog I owned...was used to being on a lead and when I took him to a neighbour's field to run, I'd simply say &quot;No&quot; when he approached a place he shouldn't go. He'd done nothing wrong, and my warning wasn't a rebuke; it was a caution for his own protection. Spirit timing is God telling you the time is not right. In university I planned to buy a computer through a discount programme . . . however, they told me it had been discontinued. I was very angry at God. Two months later the university reopened the programme offering upgraded models bundled with software that cost extra two months ago; the whole package was cheaper than the previous one...Turns out God knows what he's doing!' 
Be sensitive to Spirit signals. Trust God's Spirit to guide you in the decisions and details of your life. Keep a list of the times He has prompted you; it'll remind you to obey in the future. Remember, God's promptings always line up with His Word; even when they don't line up with your ideas!]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;Come aside...and rest a while.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 6:31 NKJV</span><br>Check out Jesus' life in the gospels; Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; and you'll see He sets us an amazing example. He was so controlled, even under extreme criticism. He never wavered from following God's plan. 
The good things in life aren't always the right things, and that's hard. You might be chasing after something that God wants you to leave, or vice versa. So how do you know what God wants? Follow Jesus' example, and get away! (Luke 4:42). Go to a deserted place, and meet with the Lord. Now, that doesn't mean you have to go and sit in your little brother's sandpit in a heatwave; it just means a quiet place to think, pray, refuel and listen to God.
It's easy in the busy-ness of life to get carried away doing everything at 100mph. We treat our brains like a Ferrari, thinking they're at their best when they're fastest. Everyone around you might tell you that time is money; and the devil loves that. If he can keep us so busy with life, surrounded by crowds and noise with no time to think, we won't be spending that quality time with God, which is what he wants.
Jesus turns the tables on the rest of the world, and says 'come to me' So will you? Will you stop, get away from it all, and check that you have been saying yes to the right things, according to God?]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Physician, heal yourself!...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 4:23 NKJV </span><br>In the Old Testament, a priest couldn't serve in God's house if he had a scab. Why? Because when you've a scab you're a health risk. We all have 'scabs'. It could be some pain in your life or an issue you haven't dealt with that still hurts. 
If you went to the doctors, and he tried to see to you while he had a huge gaping, bleeding, oozy cut on his head, you wouldn't really listen to what he was saying, would you? You'd think he needed to sort himself out first, before he sorted you. It's the same with you when you're witnessing to your friends, and working for God. It's hard to help your mates sort out emotional issues, when you've still got unresolved issues from the past. It's hard to talk about victory, and complete forgiveness to others, when you feel defeated by an old issue. Now, that doesn't mean you can't work for God if you have issues - completely the opposite in fact - often the broken become the best at mending. But you do need to be at least dealing with your issues not ignoring them. It's not wrong to have a wounded heart, but it is wrong not to deal with it. So spend some time with God and let Him heal you and make you whole, so you can be more effective in your mission to others.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...for...a time like this.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Esther 4:14 NIV</span><br>Did you know the Bible has a beauty queen in it? Not only that, but Esther also married a king, uncovered a plot to kill all the Jewish people, and saved them. Quite a life! Her story shows us how important it is to be in the right place, and let the right people influence you. Remember these two things:
1) Where you are today is no accident. If you think of your life as a swimming race, there's no time for you to just tread water - you should always be going forwards. Don't think that there's gonna be a better time, or more important opportunity - you don't choose your time, God does. He's got you where you are for a reason, so that when He calls you to do something, you're either in the right place to do it already, or on your way there.  
2) God sends special people to guide us. Mordecai was Esther's mentor, her accountability guy. Without him, she may not have ever realised what her calling was. He helped her actually get stuck in and do what God wanted.  Who is your Mordecai? Who helps you understand where you are, knows you well enough to give you a gentle kick up the bum if you go off on one? Who will encourage you when you feel ready to quit? None of us are perfect - that's why God sends friends, we really need them!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Peter heard him say, 'It is the Lord'...and jumped into the water.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 21:7 NIV</span><br>Imagine: you've been up all night, sat in a stinky boat in the middle if the lake, fishing; that's your job, it's what you do. And what have you caught? Diddly squat! Then some bloke, who isn't a fisherman, tells you to throw your nets the other side of the boat. You'd be a bit reluctant, thinking 'who does He think He is, telling me my job', but you do it anyway; and wow - not only one, but 153 fish leap into your nets! Just one question: Who is this man? One word from Him, and things change for the better. Answer: It was Jesus. 
Peter's so excited that he leaves the fish he's been slaving all night for without a second thought, leaps off the boat, and runs through the water to Jesus. For Peter, even though his nets were full, he'd achieved his goal, he didn't stay and guard his blessings. He went overboard and committed himself fully to God. Could you do that? It's a challenge for you today. When you've got what you want in life, don't just watch over it, but be willing to leave it for Jesus. 
Peter felt like he was giving up everything when he left his boat, his mates, his fish and jumped in to see Jesus; but when he got there, Jesus was cooking...fish! God knows what you need, He has it, and He'll give you it. So go on; jump out of that boat.]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...do not be like the hypocrites...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:5 NIV</span><br>Hypocrite. Have you ever called anyone that? Do you know what it actually means? The word came from a city built by Herod the Great when Jesus was just a wee boy, which had a huge outdoor theatre. The actors who performed there wore masks for each character, and were called 'hypokrites'. So 'hypocrite' basically means to wear a mask to impress or deceive other people. 
Jesus was the only person in the New Testament who used the word 'hypocrite', and he used it to refer to three specific things; giving, praying and judging. Matthew 6:2 basically says: don't tell the whole world when you give someone something, just to make yourself look good. Matthew 6:6 tells you that when you pray, it should be between you and God; not done to show off to others. Remember prayer is a conversation between you and God; you wouldn't shout out all your other conversations in life, would you? Finally, Matthew 7:2-5 reminds us that if you make a big deal out of judging others, it'll come back to bite you on the bum! You're not perfect, but don't try and make yourself look better by picking on other people's faults.
So the word for you today is, don't be a hypocrite. Be real in your giving, praying and judging. Don't wear a mask to impress or deceive those around you; let them, and God, see the real you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...having done all...stand...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 6:13 NKJV</span><br>Have you ever watched 'Unbreakable' on Channel 5? You see a bunch of nutters, doing crazy stuff, fighting to survive; and what for? Nothing! There's no prize at all; it's crazy. You'd think with the amount they go through, there would be an amazing prize.
As a Christian, you'll face some pretty tough fights too; with the devil. But you'll be pleased to know that when it comes to fighting with the devil, there is a prize! 'Blessed is the man who endures...when he has been approved, he will receive the crown...' (James 1:12 NKJV). 'Endures' means you're being tested; can you stick it out? 'Approved' means that with victory comes great things. So although it's tough when you feel like you're being attacked by everyone and everything, and you're stretched to your limits, stick with it. 'Having done all ... stand'. 
You may ask how long the attack will last, but there's no set answer, Daniel's prayers took three weeks until the angel came (Daniel 10:13). The enemy is relentless, so you must be too. Don't give up. Pray, pray and pray some more. Your persistence will overcome the enemy's resistance ... in the end. '...you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise' (Hebrews 10:36 NKJV). So stay there, keep fighting, and God will come to your aid.]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 40:31 NIV</span><br>When you pray to God, do you get a text from Him a few minutes later saying when and how He'll answer your prayer? Not likely! But God does promise that if we wait on Him, He will give us strength. Think of it a bit like papier mache; did you ever make it at primary school? You know, where you stick newspaper to a balloon. Newspaper itself isn't strong; it's well easy to rip. But the more layers you put on, the stronger it gets, until in the end, it's almost impossible to break. You're a bit like that balloon. Every time you wait on the Lord, another layer of paper is added, and you get a bit stronger. So if you're feeling like things are tough and you can't do it yourself, just wait on Him, read your Bible, pray; you will get stronger.
Don't panic; 'waiting' doesn't have to be all about sitting cross legged in silence, meditating. Sometimes it can be proactive too. If you're 'waiting' on someone in a restaurant, you're seeing to their needs; so sometimes, weird as it sounds, waiting on God involves proactively doing God's will, and serving others. Do you need more strength? Well grab hold of this promise that's yours as a child of God: 'Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart...' (Psalm 27:14 NKJV). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;Blessed...are those who hear the word...and obey.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 11:28 NIV</span><br>Loads of your mates may say success is measured by who has the latest PS3, Wii, iPod, clothes...  the list goes on - but Jesus disagrees: He said, '&quot;[Real]...life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses&quot;' (Luke 12:15 NKJV) but by how you live. So how do you make sure you live well?
1) Challenge yourself. Examine how you spend your time. After a stressy day at school, it's easy to just switch off and veg out in front of the TV. Why not take time to read God's Word and pray, even when you don't feel like it. 
2) Reach out to others. The smallest good deed in action is worth way more than the hugest good idea, so - help others. The enemy doesn't like you walking what you talk, but God loves it! He always gives you a chance to put into practice what He's taught you. Jesus said, 'Blessed...are those who hear the word...and obey.' 
3) Be more patient. There was a guy who got the ferry to work, and was always on time. One day he overslept and worried he'd be late. So he sprinted to the dock, saw the ferry two metres from the edge and did a huge leap to land on the deck. Great! ...only, seconds later the ferry actually docked; what a prat he looked! Don't always be in a hurry. The Bible says: 'Patience...can...overcome any problem' (Proverbs 25:15 CEV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If you know these things...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 13:17 AMP</span><br>How much have you got in your piggy bank? Some people think the key to happiness is money, and they spend their whole lives stressing about where to save, where to invest and thinking of ways to get more. Although that can be important, what's more important is working out how you're going to invest your life.
Three top ways to invest your life are:
1) Making time for friends and loved ones. 'Let no one seek his own, but each...the other's well-being' (1Corinthians 10:24 NKJV). Don't always put yourself first; ask your mates how they are, and spend time listening to their answer. 
2) Giving thanks. If you're finding it hard to be grateful for what God has given you, look around you and be grateful for what He's protected you from. The enemy doesn't have to steal anything from you to get between you and God, just make you take things for granted. Thank God for what He's given you today. 'From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another' (John 1:16 NIV).  
3) Practicing contentment. Paul writes, '...whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things' (Philippians 4:8 NIV). Don't wish your life away, always wanting more things. Count your blessings today, and be content with the life God has blessed you with.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Wisdom? She kicks off with respect for God. Only idiots write off wisdom and training.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 1:7 The Street Bible (Paraphrase)</span><br>Do you think Carol Vorderman got to be a whiz at maths by ignoring her teachers? Or Beckham got to be so good at bending balls by laughing at his footie coaches? Did Leona Lewis get to top the charts by never having a singing lesson? No; of course not! If you want to get good at something, you have to learn, and the best people to learn from, are those who are already good at it. So if you want to develop your Christian life, a good place to start is by finding someone you respect who can help you through stuff, who can help you learn. This proverb suggests your parents may be a good source of wisdom; now, you may see them as a pain, always telling you how to do stuff and getting on at you, but, hard as it may be to admit, they probably come up with some good advice sometimes! Listen to what they're saying, and weigh up whether it actually could be wise to follow their advice.
Just like Carol, Leona and Beckham got to be good at what they do by studying hard, practicing, and seeking advice, so should it be for you with your Christian life. To get to know God better, study His word, learn from others and respect Him. So don't be a fool; get some training and advice, and wise up.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He lived the way God wanted.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Kings 22:2 TM</span><br>A violent leader, filling a city end to end with blood; his father, killed by his own officers - it sounds like a trailer for an 18-certificate movie! But actually: it's the story of Josiah's dad and granddad. 
What a start in life! You'd think there was no hope for him with a family like that, but &quot;uh uh&quot;, you'd be wrong. Josiah was just a kid when he became king (only eight years old) and he chose to live righteously, to live for God, and didn't stop living that way all his life (check out 2 Kings 22). What's the point? We can't pick our parents, but we can pick our role-models. Your parents may have given you your DNA, but God can give you a new birth and a new beginning. You're God's child so you get His DNA. Ephesians 5v1 says 'You are God's children whom he loves, so try to be like him'. Just like Josiah, you can't control the way your family or mates respond to God, but you can control the way you respond to Him. Your past, your history, doesn't have to be your prison; you have a say in your life, a choice in the path you take. If you choose well now, maybe someday, years in the future, someone will be thanking God for the history you left for them, for your legacy. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I will give it into your hand...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 8:18 NKJV</span><br>Imagine squaring up to the school bully with Ricky Hatton two paces behind you. The mouthful of abuse old bully-pants screams your way, wouldn't faze you; you've got Ricky Hatton fighting your corner. The flexing of Mr. Bully's rather gigantic pecs wouldn't worry you; you've got Ricky backing you up. In fact, wouldn't you be tempted to make the first move; Ricky won't let you down. How brave would you be if Ricky Hatton had you covered. Well, duh! Don't you know that God has got you covered? Whatever battles you're facing at the mo, God is fighting your corner. That doesn't mean we go looking for trouble, that's not God's way, is it? Remember, Jesus prayed, 'Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven'. However, it does mean, when we know God is taking us out of our comfort zone to tackle some unjust bullying situation, we can trust that God, Himself, is backing us to the hilt. 
Before going into battle God said to Joshua: 'Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.' Joshua kicked some butt. Not because he flashed his 'God card' everywhere he felt like it, but because God, Himself prompted him to fight this particular battle. Likewise, don't mouth it off in the name of Jesus, unless Jesus has prompted you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Keep your tongue from evil...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 34:13 NIV</span><br>Imagine, '&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, the Director's cut'. The DVD extras of the bits they never used. Including the scene where Jesus stitches up Judas before he can reach for his pieces of silver. Or the scene where Jesus becomes the last Samurai, and together with Peter they chop off all the lynch mobs' ears. Or even the deleted 'resurrection scene', where Jesus comes back to life, but this time it's personal; He wants revenge! It just doesn't fit with the rest of the story does it? It doesn't sit with His teachings. It stands against all the Christian faith has to offer. When Peter sliced off the High Priests' ear, Jesus rebuked him and healed the man's ability to hear. 
What about us? Do the things we say or do just stand against all the Christian faith has to offer? Do our habits not fit with the rest of the story? Do we cut off people's ability to hear the message of God through the hurtful words we speak?   We can't just fly off the handle whenever we feel like it. We must be sensitive to God: If He tells us, 'Say nothing,' we must keep schtum. How many times do we show the DVD extra bits, that just aren't part of the story? When we get off script we ruin God's story. Stick to the facts. Stick to the story.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Simon Peter said to them, &quot;I am going fishing.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 21:3 NKJV</span><br>Some conversations make you just want to die inside by the power of 'The cringe!' Like, when your Mum has had one too many Bacardi Breezers and she slurs out the corner of her mouth 'Let me tell you how me and yer Dad first met'. Er, let's not! Too much information. Thing is, when you're feeling 'loved up', you can't help but want to relive that first romantic encounter. You may even visit that 'special place' to spark off those special memories. Perhaps, that's what Peter was doing, the night he decided to go fishing. With Jesus out of his life, (or so he thought), a trip to the place where he first met Him, might spark off some memories of the incredible journey they had shared together. Does this ring any bells with you? Do you feel like Jesus is now out of your life? Well, get back to the place you first met Him: The cross. Lay it all down at the foot of the cross, remember your first love, recommit yourself to Him. 
Some people think, Peter may have returned to what he was doing before he met Jesus: Fishing. But the story says he caught no fish.  Are you discouraged? Thinking of returning to your old life before you met Jesus. There's no fish there anymore. That old life is an empty life. Stick with God, take heart. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens...his friend</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 27:17 NKJV</span><br>Every single town high street has one. The weird busker bloke sitting there with a thousand instruments strapped to every orifice. A mouth organ wrapped round his gob, a bass drum by his size tens, a guitar nestled to his coat, and a pair of cymbals tied like a backpack. He calls it a one-man-band, but it sounds more like a loose fan-belt. Wouldn't he be just better off joining fellow looneys and forming a band. What if The Beatles or Girls Aloud was one strange bloke, chewing on a pasty, and banging out a racket with every available limb- how many albums would they have sold then? To make beautiful music, it's better to share out the instruments, share out the parts. Singer Bono said this:
 'I would be terrified to be on my own as a solo singer...I surround myself with...a band...you're only as good as the arguments you get. So maybe the reason why the band hasn't split up is that people might get this: even though I'm only one quarter of U2, I'm more than I could be if I was one whole of something else.' Solomon says something similar: 'As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens...his friend' (Proverbs 27:17 NKJV). Don't you get it yet? There's something about coming together with other people, if we want to create something beautiful.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>They committed themselves to the teaching of the apostles, [and]...life together...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 2:42 TM</span><br>Don't you just hate those American style stores where some Saturday girl reels off in your face, 'Have a nice day'. She couldn't care less whether your day consisted of being repeatedly poked in the eye with a biro, she's just told to say it, because that's the company line. Not so fast though, perhaps we do the same with people at church. Have you ever said, 'I'll pray for you' knowing full well you won't, you just said it because that's the company line. Don't you think that person can tell the difference between the company line and somebody who is genuinely concerned for their welfare? Don't you think God knows the difference? When we commit ourselves to each other like the early church did, actions speak louder than words. We pray for someone, not out of duty or because it's on the job description, we do it because we feel their hurt, we want God's good in their situation, we love them as we love ourselves.
When a man and a woman commit themselves to each other in marriage, they're committing themselves to the bad times as well as the good, that's why we have the famous line, 'For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse'. What if we were to commit ourselves like that to the people God has placed in our church. For better or worse.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Love cares more for others than for self...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;> 1 Corinthians 13:7 TM</span><br>A bad footie team is a bit like an old bra. No cups and little support! OK, bad Dad joke alert, but perhaps there's a little wisdom in it for us, as a church. See, wherever there's a group of people bunched together, there's a team. Whether it's Alex Ferguson's army of trim, toned, well groomed professional athletes or your church's rabble of cardigan wearing, comb-over hair-do'ed, misfits; wherever there is people, there's a team. 
Do you ever wonder whether there are days where Cristiano and Wayne fight over the hair gel?  Or whether Rio and Ryan argue over the finer details of the 'predestination' theory (OK, that's probably a no). Whatever differences they may have in the dressing room, gets left behind when it comes to the real action on the field. They're fighting for a greater cause than themselves. Shouldn't that be the way in our church. Don't we have a greater fight on our hands than worrying over whether we sing a hymn with an organ or a song with a phat bassline.  Top teams are made up of stars with strengths, and weaknesses. The trick is to cancel out weaknesses by playing to your strengths. What is the greatest strength of the church? LOVE!!!  When we realise the game is not just about us, its about others, we tap into the manager's top tactics.  To win the cups, we need to support each other.

When somebody hurts you, you may want to hurt them back, twice as hard. But where does that get you? Does hurting them heal your wound? No. Does humiliating them make your humiliation any easier to stomach? No. What about holding a grudge? Who feels the weight of that? Them? Or you? Bitterness can pour salt into our gaping wounds. It takes control of our moods, it robs us of our joy, it kills our attitude, it destroys our relationships. So, what's the antidote for hurt? Forgiveness. 'Ah, but you don't know what I've been through' you say. Nobody ever said this 'forgiveness' business was going to be easy. It's not. That's why we need to tap into God's power through prayer. If you can't forgive somebody, start by praying, 'Lord, I can't forgive in my own, natural strength, help me to press into Your supernatural strength to forgive in this situation'.  But why forgive at all? Jesus said, '...there is a connection between what God does and what you do. You can't get forgiveness from God, for instance, without also forgiving others' (Matthew 6:14-15 TM).
Hard teaching, but Jesus was willing to back it up with His life. Even from the cross He prayed, 'Father, forgive them'. How about you? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...The gift of God is eternal life...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 6:23 NIV</span><br>Ever feel 'there must be more to life than this?' Ever wondered what happens after you die? Do you long to get right with God? Your soul is hungry for the life Jesus can give you. Follow this:
Step 1: '...we've compiled this long and sorry record as sinners...and proved that we are utterly incapable of living the glorious lives God wills for us...' (Romans 3:23 TM). Face it, we need help from God to live right. 
Step 2: 'Work hard to sin your whole life and your pension is death. But God's gift is real life, eternal life, delivered by Jesus' (Romans 6:23 paraphrase). Jesus has bought you a ticket to life before and after death. He's paid for it by giving his life for you on the cross. 
Step 3: '...God put his love on the line for us by offering his Son in sacrificial death while we were of no use whatever to him' (Romans 5:8 TM). You can't buy the ticket off Him, all you need to do is accept the ticket as a gift from one friend to another. 
Step 4: '&quot;...God has set everything right between him and me!&quot;' (Romans 10:9-12 TM).
Now pray these words: 'Lord Jesus, I'm sorry for trying to go it alone. I place You in charge now. By faith I receive Your ticket to life now and forever. Thank You for setting everything right between You and me, amen.']]></introtext>

You know that bit when the first to buzz in gets to answer the question and The 'Migglethwaite family from Doncaster' buzz, but haven't got a clue, and lovely Vernon tells them, 'I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to hurry you for an answer'?  Well do you have your own 'Family Fortune' moments? Pushy people who pressure you for an answer, but you've not got a scooby-doo what to say? What about when old clever clogs in RE pressures you into an answer to, 'If God exists, how do you explain evolution?' Now, you know you've heard some vague explanation to this at Church once, but you'll be blowed if you can put it into words now, what do you say? Are you like Maureen from Doncaster, you end up opening your mouth for the sake of an answer? Or do you hold your tongue?  Sometimes it's wise to wait, to say, 'I don't have the answer right now but I'll look into it'. 
If you ask Him, God will tell you what to say and when to say it. His promise is: 'I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand...' (Isaiah 51:16 NIV). Family Fortunes moments may shout, 'Don't just stand there, say something' but Wisdom says, 'Don't just say something, stand there!' ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>To me...grace was given, to preach...the unfathomable riches of Christ.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 3:8 NAS </span><br>If its not, 'Kum-by-ya' it's 'Amazing Grace'. Anyone who can barely tune a guitar and strum a chord has probably tackled it. A song so famous, it must've just always existed, right? It fell from the sky one day and landed on a worship leader's fretboard, right? Actually, no. 
John Newton showed no early signs for musical masterpieces. A rough sailor, in trouble with law, at odds with authority, and always the first to diss a Christian, he cared only for himself. One night, however, he woke to find his PJ's soaked with salt water, his boat was sinking fast, his life moments from ending, when he turned to the Lord, asking for forgiveness and new life in Christ. 
The rest is musical history. The song Newton wrote about this episode in his life went a little like this: 'Amazing grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see. Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come; 'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.' How amazing is grace! How amazing is Jesus! Maybe, you feel a little like John, perhaps circumstances are drowning you at this moment. Take a note from Newton, remember, God's amazing grace is just a prayer away from rescuing you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;All that the Lord has said will we do...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 24:7 NKJV</span><br>So you've bought Nigella's new recipe book. You're going to make the world's greatest 'Super-double-whipped-cream-marshmallow-chocolate delight'. You read the recipe five times over, you memorise it, discuss it with friends, you copy it out in a journal. What more do you need to do?  The cake will bake itself, right? Of course not! It's no good merely studying the recipe! In order for the cake to rise, you need to act on the words on the page, apply what it says to reality. It's the same with God's word. We can study it at church, we can memorise favourite verses, we can create amazing pictures in our journals, but at some point don't we need to act upon it? It's not theory, it's practical.  'Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says...the man who looks intently into the perfect law...not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it - he will be blessed in what he does' (James 1:22-25 NIV). If we think reading, knowing, and even believing God's Word is all there is to it, we end up with cake on our faces. God wants us to get the most out of life, He's not interested in us being 'Bible nerds' who can quote every scripture, He's interested in seeing His Word come to life in our lives.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...My words will by no means pass away.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 13:31 NKJV</span><br>Some recipes just can't be improved upon. You don't melt a mars bar on top of fish and chips. You don't add curry sauce to a big mac. You don't do an ice cream any favours by dipping it in salt. They are all recipes that need no updating. The Word of God is the same. 'Heaven and earth will pass away, but My Words will by no means pass away.' When we eat the Word we get tried and tested, 100% pure perfection. No added preservatives or any of that junk. We get a diet that we know will do us good.
Joshua says: '&quot;Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night...do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful&quot;' (Joshua 1:8 NIV). In other words: Eat, drink and be merry. Note how he says 'meditate' on it. Meditation is when we allow our brains to have a good chew on God's word. Watch how your Alsatian can get the most out of his chewed up little bone, how much more can we get when we chew over God's wisdom. Note, also, the word, 'success'. Any athlete wishing for Olympic glory watches what they push through their face. Paula Radcliffe wouldn't get far on a kebab, and neither will you. To stay the distance you need regular helpings of the Word. ]]></introtext>

We need to be careful what we digest. It's not just our stomachs either, we need to watch what we feed our brains. Our fave mags may give us the lowdown on what's hot and what's not, but there's not enough substance their to sustain us. Our spiritual lives need a good dose of iron and all the right ingredients. We need to tuck into our Bibles for a healthy feed. It's a diet of a) POWER. Read Luke 4 to understand the power of Jesus' Word. It's a healthy tale of forces submitting to God's Word  b) FORCE. '...by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed...' (2 Peter 3:5 NIV). God didn't call in the builders when He made the world, His Word alone was enough to create all that exists c) LIFE. 'The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life' (John 6:63 NIV). When you eat the Word of God, it can't just sit there and do nothing, it comes to life. It gets to work in you and starts to produce results.  So don't just sit there drooling, tuck in, feed your face with the Word.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Give, and it will be given to you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 6:38 NIV</span><br>Three reasons to hang on to your purse strings: 1) with the credit crunch in full bloom you'll need every penny you can get  2) it's a tight month you can always give a little next month  3) wait til you've landed that dream job with that dream salary, then give! 
If you're not going to give, feel free to choose any of the above as your reason. For those of us, who want to give, feel free to choose one of the following: 
1) When we give - we get! Jesus said, 'Give and it will be given to you...the measure you use...will be measured to you' (Luke 6:38 NIV). Test Jesus in this, put your money where his mouth is, see what happens. 2) We get back more than we give. If a bank lends you money, they whack a load of interest on top - so in effect, you always pay back way more than you borrowed. The Bible says when we give to the poor we lend to God (Proverbs 19:17). Imagine that- loaning to God! What kind of interest does God pay back? 
3) We get into good habits. Giving is not just how the church raises its budget, it's how God raises His children. Parents want to raise their children to cultivate beautiful qualities such as: generosity. Our heavenly parent is no different. So, pick a reason!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He cancelled the record...against us...by nailing it to [Christ's] cross.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 2:14 NLT</span><br>So what do you think of when you hear the words, 'criminal record'? Your Dad's 'Phil Collins' Greatest Hits collection'? A special certificate awarded to those who break the law? Or a long list of sins committed by your good self? 
However good we may think we are, we're never good enough by 'holy' standards. So you might not be on par with the Kray Twins when it comes to dodgy dealings, but can you honestly say, 'I've never told a lie', 'I've never slagged someone behind their back', 'I've never in my darker moments wished someone would get run over by a bus'? The Bible says we've all fallen short of God's standards. We've all created our own list of sins, our own catalogue of wrongs, our own criminal record. So what is the sentence for all this rubbish? Community service? Probation? Life imprisonment? Actually, there's no way we could ever serve our sentence. How can imperfect creatures like us satisfy the holy perfect standards of God? The answer is we can't. But we know a Man who can! We know a Man who did. He's served our sentence for us. He's paid our bail. He's got us off the hook. His name is Jesus. When Jesus hung on the cross, a penalty was being paid. A death penalty. Our death penalty. Our criminal record was being wiped clean by the blood of the lamb. Er...praise to Jesus, anyone?

Burn your toast and spill your coffee down your school uniform as you scribble down bits of unfinished homework in between watching the telly and listening to Chris Moyles. Start your day off like that and is it any wonder you're fit for a panic attack before you've even caught the school bus? The way we get up can set the mood for the rest of the day.
What if, tomorrow, you were to set your alarm 20 minutes earlier? What if, the first thing you did was say, 'Morning God, thanks for the night's kip and thanks for a new day, help me find the beauty in this morning, and help me not embarrass myself or your name by my attitude today. Amen'. Try it. Note down any differences about your day. See if your worries are put into perspective. Can starting your day with God alter the way you close your day with God? 
Tomorrow morning, sprinkle this Scripture on your cornflakes: 'Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14 NIV).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...the wisdom that is from above is...peaceable...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 3:17 NKJV</span><br>Peace, man, peace! When we think of 'peace', our heads might jump to a picture of a middle-aged man with long, girly hair, puffing on a pipe full of 'waccy-baccy'. It's as if the hippies copyrighted the word. But the Bible had a lot to say about peace long before those hemp wearing tree-huggers got a whiff of it. James 3:18 tells us that God's Word is 'sown in peace'. Colossians 3:15 tells us 'the peace of Christ keep you in tune with each other...' Even Jesus, himself, promises us, 'My peace I leave with you'. So, why the big deal? Because it's God's way. And what happens when we live God's way? We develop care and concern for others. We gain a kick in our step. We get passion and compassion for those in need. We want to bring peace to the places where there's destruction. 
The world's way is to 'look after number one', God's way is to 'discover the beauty in everyone'. Do you know someone who seriously tests your patience? You know the type, they could turn Ghandi into the Karate Kid, they just have that knack of winding people up. Well, next time they're testing your peace,  rather than hit back in retaliation, ask God to reveal their beauty to you, ask God to show to you how He sees them. Exercise self-control and keep your peace!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...whoever sows generously will also reap generously.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 9:6 NIV</span><br>So it's Saturday afternoon, you're in town and ready to throw some serious money at TopShop. You're within sight of the inviting entrance when a bearded bloke selling the Big Issue rustles his latest edition in your direction. You pause for a second, then do the right thing, handing over a crisp, clean note, with a smug sense of self-satisfaction. Your warm glow is slightly chilled when he starts feeling around his deep, empty pockets for your change. He smiles as he tells you, 'Sorry, luv, I don't seem to have any shrapnel on me'. What do you do? a) tell him, you'll buy a copy later, once you have change from your latest purchase b) laugh into his bearded brow, telling him it'll be a cold day in hell before you part with a tenner for a copy of a mag you'll barely skim over c) sow generously. Tell him, 'that's alright mate, you keep the change. God bless you'. 
When we sow generously, there is always a cost; if you were to part with your hard earned cash (like in option c, above), it may mean not being able to afford those 'to-die-for' jeans, but as we ditch one purchase we end up with the better buy. We buy the happiness of others and in return bless ourselves, because if we believe the word of God, 'whoever sows generously will also reap generously']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The...many parts...form one body</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 12:12 NIV </span><br>Have you ever tried painting with your eyes closed, swimming without your legs, or having a conversation without opening your mouth? They're all possible, but really difficult! It's much easier to use your eyes, legs and mouth. But what does that have to do with 'church'?
Well, there may be people in your church that you struggle with, that you never speak to - maybe even avoid. Sometimes, you may think it's better if you don't even go to church, 'cos everyone's so different to you'.
This passage is saying that's not the way to go about it at all. Just like you work better, when your body is working together, and you don't isolate one bit, 'church' is the same. The Bible talks about us as all being different parts of the same body - and all the parts are important, and help things to be done better. So rather than trying to go it alone, you'll find life easier if you've got the other bits of the body to help you through it. You'll be helping others too - 'cos if you're not there, that means there's a bit missing for other people! Just as much as you need them, they need you - so don't be disheartened, but encouraged by church, and embrace all the differences that people have. God made us all that way for a reason, so that together we can do stuff well.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...shine like stars in the universe.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:15 NIV</span><br>Have you ever had a really bad day? All you want to do is have a go at everyone, to make them feel as bad as you do?
Here, Paul says 'DON'T!'. Don't try to drag others down just because you're feeling manky. Instead, build them up. Even though it's really hard, try and be positive. Remember, no matter how bad your day is, you've got a message of life; eternal life. That message isn't just for you, you know; it's for everyone. And it's your job to help share that message, to make sure that everyone gets a chance to hear it and choose how they're going to respond to it. You can't get away with thinking that it's your mates' job, or expecting your youth leader to tell everyone. Not even your vicar will do it for you. It's your job. Yours. And what's one of the best ways to do that, to show others what God can do for them? By standing out from the crowd. Not for being grumpy, but for being positive. By shining like a star, being the light in the darkness. The message of God is a message of hope. Today, why don't you try and be positive to those around you, and share with them the best news in the world! No-one else can make you shine; only you can do it, with God helping you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 6:26 NIV</span><br>There's a story of a little boy whose mum died. Every night he toddled into his dad's room to ask if he could sleep with him. Only when his father promised to sleep with his face turned towards him, did the little guy feel safe enough to doze off. He needed to know his dad was looking out for him. When we're struggling, we need to remember that God is looking out for us, His face is towards us. It's not just when we're struggling either, but God watches over us, guides and protects us 24:7. How awesome is that?!
The most common promise in the Bible is, '...I will be with you...' (Joshua 1:5 NKJV). God made that promise to Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Mary and Paul; quite a list! And that promise kept them going through the stickiest of situations! David said, 'Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me...' (Psalm 23:4 NIV). God used all sorts of ways to remind His people He was with them constantly; from the manna in the wilderness to the pillar of cloud and fire that went before them. How is God reminding you He's with you today? Remember, 'Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged...the Lord...will be with you' (Joshua 1:9 NIV). Be at peace; God is looking out for you!]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 16:5 NKJV</span><br>Back in the good old days of Bible times, the people of Israel were always scrapping with the neighbouring nations. David's seven brothers were all in the army but none of them would fight Goliath; why? Three reasons:
1) They let the fear of others get to them. Fear is more contagious than the 'flu. If you listen to it long enough you'll get infected. Listening to Goliath and his scare tactics wore down David's brothers. Who are you listening to? Get God's opinion, build your life around it and let His Word to settle every issue.  
2) They didn't have a personal track record with God to rely on. David's little battles prepared him for the big ones. He killed a big lion as a boy, a bigger bear later, and Goliath was massive. Was he freaked out by it? No. Listen: 'The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and...the bear...will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine' (1 Samuel 17:37 NKJV). He relied on his 'God moments' from the past, and you can do the same. 
3) They may have been fit, but they weren't going for God. You've heard the phrase 'don't judge a book by its cover' - well, people might, but God doesn't. He goes straight to the heart (1 Samuel 16:7 NKJV). David's heart was moulded by years of spending time with God. Can you say that too?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I've got my eye on the goal, where God is beckoning us onward-to Jesus.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:14 TM</span><br>Did you watch any of the Olympics back in the summer? Thousands of people meeting together, trying desperately to be the best and win the gold medal. Now, do you think that any of the people who actually won gold just turned up on the day with no planning? Did they just wake up and decide they fancied winning a medal that day? Of course not! Your relationship with God is a bit like a race, so follow these key tips to help you get it right:  
1) Be prepared. Make sure you know your race, and know your prize. 
2) Good foundations lead to good results. You won't get there without training, and doing your homework on what obstacles you might come across. 
3) Being 100% fit gives you the best head start. No athlete would go into a race without being fit for it, so exercise in your bible reading and praying. 
4) Keep your eye on the goal. Focus on your prize; an eternity with Jesus. Watch a sprint race on TV; all the athletes are so focused on the finish line that nothing distracts them from getting there.
It might feel like those around you are running a different route, or following a different training programme. You may even feel you're in the wrong race sometimes. Don't let that distract you from God's plan for you. Stay close to Him, know your race, focus on the prize; and you'll get the gold.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Every man shall give as he is able.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 16:17</span><br>There are over 2,000 Scriptures in the Bible on money and giving. Check out Deuteronomy 16:17 and 2 Corinthians 9:7 as just two examples of passages that are relevant to all Christians - even you!
Now, you may be thinking &quot;but I don't have much money - only my pocket money, allowance, or a bit from my Saturday job&quot;. That may be true, but no matter how much money you have - or haven't - got, these passages are still important. 
Firstly, you need to recognise that whatever you have, God still asks you to cheerfully give with it. That doesn't mean you have to give every penny away - it just means don't be selfish with it and keep it all for yourself. Think about putting a bit in the collection at church, or giving to a charity who you think do good work, because you want to help. 
Secondly, these passages aren't just talking about money. Think about all the other things God has given you - gifts, talents, skills - and think about the ways you could use those 'as you are able', and how you can give of those gifts cheerfully. That may mean offering to help with the Sunday school or kids church, if you're good with kids, or singing in the band if God's given you a good voice, or helping serve tea if you've got a gift of hospitality. 
So have a think today - how can you give with a smile on your face?]]></introtext>

Holiday time's great isn't it? Taking time off from the humdrum routine of school, college, uni or work - we love it!! But God is quite clear that there's one thing that we should never take time off from and that's being a Christian. What!! No time off? - EXACTLY! 
Living as a child of God is 24/7 - no time off included. God wants us to always be ready - not only speak to anyone who'll listen about Him, but also to show His love through what we do and what we say.
That means being a Christian not just on a Sunday, but when you're at home....yes even when your little brother has just robbed your diary and blabbed it to mum, yes even at College when you discover someone's been spreading nasty rumours about you, yes even when your stuck behind that doddery old man in the queue at the shop. God wants you always to be ready to let people know by your words and actions how much Jesus loves them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>all you who... walk in the light of your fires... will lie down in torment</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 50:11 NIV</span><br>When the darkness around you is part of God's plan don't try to create your own light: 'You who live in your own light...will soon fall down in great torment.' Abraham tried that when he sensed the light of God's promise of son going dim over time. Tired of waiting, he decided to go get it on with his maid instead of his wife - errr - big mistake Abe! And what about Peter who promised to follow Jesus to prison and to death (Luke 22:33)? When darkness fell he didn't wait for instructions and ended up chopping off an innocent man's ear! 
Let's get one really important point clear: when you're in darkness by divine design you don't have to be scared, God will bring you through, night always gives way to morning! The Bible gives us great promises: '...weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning' (Psalm 30:5 NIV). The forty dark days Moses spent alone on the mountain, the same time spent by Jesus in the wilderness being tempted, they were essential to God's plans. Jesus said, 'What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight...' (Matthew 10:27 NIV). So remember, 1) It may be in a really dark moment that God gives you an amazing revelation. 2) People will listen to you because you've 'earned the right to speak' - you've been there. So you never need to be scared of the dark!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 23:4 NIV</span><br>Psalm 23 is amazing in all sorts of ways, one of which is this: David goes from talking about God, 'The Lord is my Shepherd,' to talking with Him, 'You are with me.' What happened in between? David learned that no matter how dark the way is, God is there to guide us by the hand. He realised that it's better to walk through the dark valley with God than stand on the mountaintop alone. 
God doesn't always send you places where the sun is shining, but He promises, 'When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.' (Isaiah 43:2 NIV). When you feel like you're out of your depth or in over your head, claim that promise! When you can't find the reason, trust the relationship. God won't fail you. 
It's amazing just how many of the important steps forward taken by people in the bible happened in the darkness. Another one of the famous Psalms gets this point across really poetically, '...the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.' (Psalm 139:12 NIV). So instead of running from the darkness today, ask God to develop your night vision, to show you 'the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places' (NIV). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 50:10 NIV</span><br>Yes, God promises us peace, but we also know that bad things can happen to good people. Isaiah makes it clear that there will be times when darkness will even surround people who love God. Check your Bible, there's plenty of examples. What about Job who was well blessed before suddenly losing everything? He cried out, 'He has blocked my way...he has shrouded my paths in darkness' (Job 19:8 NIV)  But is darkness our enemy? Maybe not. Think about this: Faith is like film - you remember that stuff - the stuff you used to put into cameras before everything went digital! Well the thing about film is that has to be 'developed' in the dark - the tiniest bit of light will ruin the photograph. Our dark days make us lean on God in ways we normally wouldn't. The truth is, if our faith was never tested we wouldn't be motivated to draw closer to God. It's like the old song: 'When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace. When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.' Anyone can praise God when life is good. It's when darkness falls that we find out what our faith is made of. It's in those times that we start to develop night vision! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Speaking the truth in love, we will...grow up.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:15 NIV</span><br>The Bible talks about 'Speaking the truth in love'; yeah but how? Suppose a couple fall out with each other because he's always late. She could give him a piece of her mind and list off all of his faults, or give him the silent treatment, or give them both a chance to find a solution and try something like this: 
'I feel frustrated....' No blame, no attack; just an honest expression of her own emotion.  'When you are late...' No judging, name-calling or labelling; just a concrete description of his action. 'It feels like the other things you are doing are more important than me...' No moralising; just honestly sharing her feelings. 'Please try to be on time, or call and let me know when you'll be here...' Instead of focusing on past actions he can't change, she's telling him what she'd like him to do differently next time. 
'Do you mind doing that for me?' No demanding or taking for granted; just asking for consideration and cooperation. You might not have a &quot;late boyfriend&quot; it might be your parents, mates or people at work who keep doing stuff that winds you up. How can you go further than just speaking your mind but be honest without blaming and look for a solution not just a fight? Think about that and you will be closer speaking truth in love. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:15 NIV</span><br>Mates sometimes fall out. After all, being friends doesn't mean you have to act like cbeebies characters, holding hands and constantly grinning, but how you deal with disagreement makes or breaks friendships. Ever felt like you've won the argument but lost a friend?  Here are three ways to that people handle conflict. 
1) Avoid them:  These are the people who hate to rock the boat, they fear confrontation and don't what to upset everyone; even if THEY have been upset. So they bury their feelings. But like the bad guy in a cheesy action movie, just when you think you've killed off those feelings, they spring back to life. If you try to clam up, the feelings build up and then you blow up - often at the wrong person!  
2) Attack them: These are the 'get them before they get you' people; who use words, gossip and maybe fists to wound each other. The Bible says, 'If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.' Attack leads to counterattack, both sides 'dig in' and nothing gets resolved 
3) Approach them. These people are sensitive to the feelings of others, yet talk about their feelings to God and their friend. They try to deal with the issues without blaming or scoring points and will try to be the first to say sorry. 
Which are you?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[Jesus] understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testing we do.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:15 NLT</span><br>Ever found yourself saying, &quot;You don't understand what I'm going through&quot; or &quot;Isn't there anyone who understands how I feel&quot;?  If you have then like most, you probably have experienced times when you're struggling with what's happening in your life, or you're finding living a Christian life difficult, because the temptation to do the opposite is so strong. You could even be experiencing this today? At times like this we can long for someone to 'be there' for us, someone to just 'get' what we're going through. But sometimes rather than feeling supported we can feel misunderstood, ignored, alone.
Well today there is some great news coming your way. Never again do you have to feel like no-one understands what you're going through. NEVER! The Bible tells us that, 'Jesus understands everything you're going through!' and that means EVERYTHING!
Now before you start thinking, &quot;Don't be daft, how can Jesus possibly understand EVERYTHING about me and my life? How can Jesus know what I'm going through, he never even did anything wrong.&quot; - GET THIS: The Bible tells us that 'because Jesus lived on this earth He was tempted in every way and experienced the same feelings that we go through' AND because of this he 'talks to God about you, asking Him to help you.' How good is that?! Today whatever you're going through, know Jesus does understand and is, 'for you not against you!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 14:17 NIV</span><br>Yesterday we read about Paul preaching to the villagers of Lystra. They weren't like the boffins in Athens, or religious Jews that Paul would end up talking to. These guys didn't know a lot about philosophy or religion but they did know about farming. Check out Paul's sermon: 
&quot;We are bringing you good news, telling you...turn to the living God who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them... Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.&quot; (Acts 14:15-17 NIV)
In other sermons Paul bangs on about Jewish history or the words of Greek poets but to the farmers he talks about rain, crops and lunch. Why? Because he wants them to get it, so he talks about the stuff THEY understand. Today, words like 'born again', 'sin', 'redeemed', 'house of God' often make it into our talks and songs yet don't make much sense to non-Christians. So when we talk to our mates, we need to think about HOW we talk about God. Here's a challenge: write down what a Christian is without using church words; if you're into skating or hip-hop use the words from your culture, just make sure it makes sense. Then tell your mates.]]></introtext>

Let's look at what happened to Paul, in a town called Lystra, after he prayed for a disabled man who then started walking for the first time; 'When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they went wild, calling out...&quot;These men are gods!&quot;...Paul finally realized what was going on...calling out, &quot;We're not gods! We are men just like you&quot;' (Acts 14:11-15 TM). God used Paul to do something awesome but instead of focusing on God the people start to big up Paul. This is so easy for US to do in a celeb-crazed culture.
1) Don't get giddy about &quot;famous Christians&quot;: Festivals and events are full of young people who &quot;worship&quot; the bands, preachers or even the worship leaders. They are just doing God's stuff so get excited about HIM not THEM. 
2) If God uses YOU don't let it go to your head: The next day in Lystra, the same people who were cheering were chucking rocks at Paul (v19) It was a good job Paul was doing it for God and not for the cheers! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...with the ability...God supplies...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4:11 NKJV</span><br>When God gives you an assignment He gives you all that's needed to fulfil it. In fact, by working out what you're really good at helps you figure out your calling. Winston Churchill said, 'To each there comes in his or her lifetime a special moment when they are tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talent. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour.' 
You can't always be what you want to be (see X-factor!), but you can be everything God wants you to be. That's because He assigns us '...each according to his own ability' (Matthew 25:15 NKJV). What do you love doing and do consistently well? Is music your thing? What about computers or maybe helping with little kids? Paul says, 'Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NIV). That means some of the things other people find boring, will give you a buzz.  That's not an excuse to ONLY do the stuff you love-not many people feel gifted to be pick up rubbish or stack the chairs-we can ALL do that! But stop apologising for the skills you don't have and discover the gifts God has given you and put them to work for His kingdom.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In it was a swarm of bees and some honey, which he scooped out...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 14:8-9</span><br>There's a story in the Bible that talks about Samson. You remember Samson right, the guy with superhuman strength and no hairdresser? One day Samson is really peckish, he spots some bees making some honey and just sticks his hand in and grabs some (the hive was in a dead lion but I don't think he was that bothered about health and hygiene regulations!).  Fresh, golden, delicious! 
How often do we miss out on something sweet because we're scared of getting stung? Maybe someone is scared to go out with someone they fancy in case they get hurt. Or someone else doesn't take up the opportunity of a role in the school production in case they fail or look stupid. Most times in life we have to get past the bees to get the honey.  If your life feels boring don't blame God. Neither bees nor honey are boring! God has dreamt up some great opportunities for you but they don't come gift-wrapped (remember the lion!). In fact a lot of they time they look impossible; but that's the idea. Think about David standing in front of Goliath or Peter stepping out of the boat to walk towards Jesus riding the waves without a surf board. These guys became giant-killers and water-walkers but they had to get past it being scary or even looking impossible. They had to get past the bees and so do you! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves...but our sufficiency is from God</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:5 NKJV</span><br>The Israelites were slaves in Egypt, tortured and beaten and desperate for freedom. So Moses turns up, bugs and bugs the Pharaoh to set the Israelites free (he even uses real bugs!) and finally they've got freedom and the promise of a new life in a new land. Sorted. Well until lunchtime! In the wilderness, God gave them food everyday, called Manna, but it wasn't long before they were whingeing like toddlers...'If only we had meat to eat!  We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost; also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.  But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!' (Numbers 11:4-6 NIV) They'd forgotten all about the whips and beatings now all they remembered was the cucumbers! That might make Jamie Oliver happy but not God! He had promised them a land where they could grow their own cucumbers with the added bonus of NOT being slaves. But before they enter the land and grow veggies, they need to grow up and that meant learning to depend on Him. 
Remember your first week at High School, it might be scary but you can't go back to primary! Growing with God isn't always easy, but we can't go back, we have to learn to trust Him. God has great plans for you to grow. When it's tough don't look back just look to Him!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...you are...fellow citizens...members of God's household... a holy temple...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 2:19-21 NIV</span><br>Do you know that you can enjoy God's presence at any time? You are 'No longer strangers...but fellow citizens...of the household of God...a holy temple' (NKJV). Let's unpack what that means:
1) as 'fellow citizens' we represent God on the earth. We're His 'ambassadors' (2 Corinthians 5:20). 'What does an ambassador do?' Well it's a lot more than putting on posh parties where people eat chocolate! The ambassador lives in a foreign country showing everyone who lives there how amazing his home country is. He doesn't belong there permanently, he could be called home at a moment's notice. Getting the idea? 
2) because we belong to the 'household of God' we can open the door to God at any time, with any need, and know that we'll be met with love. God is the father you always hoped for and you are the child He always wanted. If you have any doubts, look at the cross; that's how much God loves you. 
3) we are 'a holy temple.' In the Old Testament God had a temple for His people, but now God has a people for His temple. What's the difference? Well are you made of stone?! The Bible says, 'Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?' (1 Corinthians 6:19-20 NIV). Just like the temple of old your life now displays the awesome greatness of God! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But we have this treasure in jars of clay.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 4:7 NIV</span><br>Finally there's the biggie: Disappointment in ourselves. This kind of disappointment can throw you into a downward spiral that's hard to stop or recover from; so watch out! 
Peter had sworn undying love to Jesus. 'Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will' (Matthew 26:33-75), and he meant every word of it. But under the pressures surrounding the crucifixion he crumbles and three times denies knowing Jesus. Heartbroken by his own dismal failure, '...went outside and wept bitterly' (Luke 22:62 NIV). Have you ever asked, 'God, how can you possibly use someone as messed up as me?' Welcome to Peter's world. Peter became overwhelmed by feelings of failure and went on a major downer. But Jesus wasn't shocked. He was well aware that Peter was a work-in-progress. He knew that this impulsive, outspoken disciple had a tender heart, so He extended extra grace to him. After his resurrection He took time out to restore the failed disciple. For Peter the years after his biggest failure were more spectacular than he could've ever imagined. 
So, when (not if!) you fail: a) don't drown in disappointment b) come to Jesus honestly and say sorry. Confess your sin; don't make excuses, or blame circumstances or people c) receive God's grace by faith, not by feelings. You are never beyond grace d) get whatever help you need to get back on track; sooner, not later.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now go, lead the people...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 32:34 NIV</span><br>Here are two more types of disappointment you'll deal with in life:
1) Disappointment in those you work with. In life you need people, going it alone sometimes sounds attractive but the reality is pretty harsh, that's why we choose to work together. But when the people in your team fail you it hurts. Imagine Moses' disappointment. He left his brother Aaron in charge while he went to meet with God. When he came back Aaron had totally lost the plot and made the people a fake God; a golden cow! But watch Moses; his true leadership shines in the face of this disappointment. He confronts Aaron, takes it to God for resolution, and prays forgiveness for Israel. With God on his side Moses makes some great decisions and the horrible mess gets sorted out. 
2) Disappointment in those you've poured your life into. Let's check in again with Moses, Pastor of the 'Church of the Ungrateful'. This congregation of former slaves were on their way to the Promised Land, but how did show their thanks to the man who put everything on the line to make it possible? By moaning and groaning and blaming him for everything bad that happened (Exodus 14). Was Moses disappointed and hurt? Yes. But each time he wanted to quit he'd come to God and offload. You know you can do that too, right?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 3:19 NKJV</span><br>Welcome to life; disappointment guaranteed! So here are some examples to help you when: 
1) You're disappointed with those you look up to. Think of Samuel and Eli (1 Samuel 1-4). Sam's mum, Hannah, entrusted her child to Eli the Priest, confident he'd be a great mentor to the young boy. But Eli turned out to be a weak parent who stood by while his sons abused their priestly privileges, bringing shame to the ministry. Who'd have blamed young Samuel for taking a nose dive when the man he looked up to failed so badly? But somehow Samuel looked beyond his disappointment and kept his eyes on God: 'Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him.' As a result God turned him into one of Israel's greatest prophets.
2) You're disappointed in those you live with. Surely your family won't let you down. Right? Wrong! Ask young Joseph. When God gave him a big dream he thought his brothers would celebrate. Instead they were so jealous and angry that they sold him to human traffickers! What an open door to a life of bitterness - surely that kind of disappointment would leave Joseph emotionally paralysed? But no, even though many years of his life were very, very tough Joseph lived for God in every situation. Finally, many years later the breakthrough came, he became Egypt's Prime Minister and was re-united with his family. So don't let disappointment get you down today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;> 1 John 3:16 </span><br>Do you know that if you go online you will find over 70,000 web pages dedicated to the Anti-Valentines Day movement?! You can buy an Anti-Valentines Day T-Shirt, you can listen to the Top Ten Anti-Valentines Day songs, you can read Anti-Valentines Day poetry, and share your own. And if you're really Anti-Valentines Day you can find out where your nearest Anti-Valentines Day party is, although it would probably be full of quite scary people!
So why are so many people turning against this annual 'celebration of love'? Well the answer's pretty obvious isn't it. They (and maybe you too) have seen through the tacky commercialism, they have realised their value isn't measured by whether they get a card from a secret admirer or not. Being Anti-Valentines Day isn't being Anti-Love; in fact it's the opposite. It seems that people want to protect true love from being cheapened by chocolates and cheesy cards. It's like people are realising that 'selling love' is out of order. 
In his letters the Apostle John shares loads about love, he had a special revelation about the way it flows directly from God's heart to ours, '...God is love...' he wrote (1 John 4:16 NIV), going on to add 'Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him' and underlining that 'We love because he first loved us.'
So today, feel free to be Anti-Valentines Day, but don't ever be Anti-Love.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I die of thirst...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 15:18 NKJV</span><br>Samson was an extreme character who swung from massive highs to major lows, listen: 'The Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; and...his bonds broke loose...He found a fresh jawbone...took it, and killed a thousand men...Then he...cried out to the Lord and said, &quot;You have given this great deliverance...now shall I die of thirst?&quot;' (Judges 15:14-18 NKJV). Check out these three things:
1) Samson allowed the enemy to bind him. What has you tied up today? What's holding you back? Even super-macho Samson couldn't win every battle in his own strength. It took God's Spirit to set Samson free and that's what it's going to take to set you free too.  2) Samson needed to use what had already been given him. Just the jawbone of a donkey, but with God's help it was enough to win the day. The answer you're looking for may be right under your nose. Ask God to help you recognise what He's given you, and use it.  3) Samson was victorious, yet dying of thirst. It happens, particularly to those who work for God but don't spend enough time with Him. Jesus promises '...whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.' (John 4:14 NIV). It's hard to celebrate a victory when you feel dry and tired, so jump into the refreshing river of God today. The One who gives you victory, can also quench your thirst.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...bring them down to the water, and I will test them...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 7:4 NKJV</span><br>Are you a nurturer by nature, somebody who will spend hour after hour, day after day, week after week trying to help your mates overcome their issues? If so you'll know that it can be frustrating, very often one step forwards two steps back! God loves that kind of faithfulness but be careful; He doesn't need you to do His job for Him, you need to know where your work ends and His work starts! 
Gideon was surrounded by too many people and lots of them were in the 'high maintenance' category! Through a series of tests God showed Gideon who he should keep with him and who he should send home. During the first test, the 'fear test' Gideon lost 22,000 men, leaving only 10,000. Next was the 'water test' to 'Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink' (v5). Only 300 soldiers passed the test!  We learn two lessons from this story: 1) you need to be able to see your enemy approaching. Those who got down to drink like dogs, sacrificed their vision to satisfy their immediate need  2) when God reduces your support, it's in order to give you a miraculous victory. So when the people around you can't pass God's 'water test,' let them go and trust God. He has something better in mind. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let each of you look out...for the interests of others.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:4 NKJV </span><br>You see one of your mates and shout, 'How's it going?' Thinking you're actually interested, they come over to tell you something cool that happened to them yesterday. But you're not really interested are you so you jump in as fast as you can saying, 'Think that's cool? Let me tell you about...' You're off and running, making every effort to outdo them and prove that your life is way more interesting that theirs!  Meanwhile, your mate's wishing they'd just kept walking when they first saw you. They'd hoped to hear something like, 'That's awesome, tell me more.' Instead they just get an earful of your ego. 
The Bible says, 'Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.' In other words, give up 'centre stage.' That's easier said than done when we tend to only be bothered with one person - me! Whatever happened to 'Rejoice with those who rejoice...' (Romans 12:15 NIV)? Those simple words remind us that life is not supposed to be a competition - it's supposed to be a celebration! So next time you feel the urge to interrupt, practice saying, 'Enough about me. How are things with you?' Then listen! Listen with your ears, your eyes, your mind and your spirit. Try to understand the feelings coming through. Then you can 'Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn..' (Romans 12:15 NIV) ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If My people who are called by My name...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;> 2 Chronicles 7:14 NKJV</span><br>This time last year nobody was thinking about saving money; it was 'business as usual', spend, spend, spend. Wow, haven't times change? Skyrocketing fuel prices have forced people to park their petrol-guzzlers and take the bus. Other people were talking about 'climbing the property ladder'; now they're struggling to pay their mortgage. Flash floods seem to strike whenever they please. It feels like our security blanket has been ripped away and our comfort zone shaken to its core.
But there is an ancient Word for these crazy days; it's an old message for a new generation. 'If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land' (2 Chronicles 7:14). Have you heard those words before? Can you sense God speaking from eternity? Those words are a reminder that every action brings a reaction. If we spend money we haven't got, if we treat the planet like it's disposable, trouble will definitely come our way. 
Listen, we need to turn things around and someone needs to set an example. Even within a pampered church that majors on 'what God will do for you, and how to get Him to do it', God has people willing to be humble and get praying. The question is, will you be one of them?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...live a life of love...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 5:2 NIV</span><br>The great Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle married his secretary, Jane Welsh. She kept working for him but when she got ill, Carlyle, who was devoted to his work, didn't really notice. But she had cancer and was eventually confined to bed. Although Carlyle loved her, he found that he didn't have much time to give attention to give to her. Then she died. After the funeral Carlyle found Jane's diary and began to read it. On one page she'd written a single line: 'Yesterday he spent an hour with me and it was like heaven: I love him so much.' A reality he'd somehow been too blind to see now revealed itself with crushing clarity. He'd been too busy to notice how much he meant to Jane. He thought of all the times he'd been preoccupied with his work and failed to notice her. He hadn't seen her suffering. He hadn't seen her love. Turning the page, he read words he'd never forget: 'I've listened all day to hear his steps in the hall, but now it's late, he won't come today.' Thomas was devastated. Later, friends found him at the side of her grave, covered with mud. His eyes were red from weeping, 'If only I'd known, if only I'd known,' he cried. After Jane's death, Carlyle made little attempt to write again. 
Nothing is more important than love. Is there anyone you need to spend time with today? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Love the Lord your God with all your heart...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV</span><br>There's an interesting sequence of events leading up to Peter's denial of Christ. First, Jesus warned Simon Peter that he was a target: '&quot;...Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail...&quot;' (Luke 22:31-32 NIV). Next we read that when the guards had arrested Jesus, Peter '...followed at a distance' (Luke 22:54 NIV). Later that same night Peter, the man who swore he'd die for Jesus, denied knowing Him. Then the cockerel crowed, Peter realised what he'd done, and he '...went outside and wept bitterly' (Luke 22:55-62 NIV). 
Can you see the three steps? 1) you don't pay attention to the warnings about the enemy's attack b) you allow situations to get between you and Jesus; you start to follow 'at a distance' 3) you end up denying Jesus by your words or actions. It's a classic process that happens to lots of people, so don't say, 'That will never happen to me.' That's what Peter said! Instead make sure you stay on your guard, and stay passionate. That red-hot fire inside you to make Jesus known is like your fuel for the race. Lewis Hamilton wouldn't win many Grand Prix races without fuel, but he also has to stay focused too, as every lap contains new dangers. So there's the Word 4u 2day, keep your passion alive and stay focused, then you'll withstand any attacks. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...do not worry...' </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:31 NIV</span><br>King David writes, 'I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread' (Psalm 37:25 NIV). Nobody can say that King David lived a 'sheltered life'! He lived on the front line, and so when as an old man he shares his reflections about the way the world works we need to pay attention. His advice to the next generation is to learn how to lean on God: 'Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this;' (Psalm 37:3-5 NLT). The sad thing is, even though David, Israel's greatest King, took the time to write down this advice, and even though it was taught year in year out in the schools and the synagogues of the land, the people just didn't follow it. When Jesus began to minister He had to deal with the same issue saying: 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;...your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well' (Matthew 6:31-33 NIV). So today, relax, no really, chill, trust, God will provide!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...take captive every thought...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV </span><br>Nineteen-year-old Liu Shih-Kun was an amazing pianist in China until the 1966 Cultural Revolution banned all things of Western influence. Refusing to renounce his beloved music, Liu was branded an enemy of the state and thrown into a tiny jail cell with no friends, no books, and even worse; no piano. Six years later, for political reasons, he was asked to play in Beijing with the Philadelphia Orchestra. After years without an instrument to practice on, he performed brilliantly. Eighteen months later when he was finally released, he again played flawlessly. His secret? Stripped of everything musical, for seven and a half years Liu disciplined himself to shut out negative thoughts and practice hour after hour on an imaginary piano.
What if you were in that position; all alone, the things you love taken away, would you find a positive focus or would you freak out and think of the worst thing that could happen? Police shout 'Freeze!' when they want to stop a suspect and protect themselves. And you can freeze out harmful thinking by capturing every thought and making it 'obedient to Christ.' Paul says: 'For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against... the spiritual forces' (Ephesians 6:12 NIV). Your thoughts have power. To win over them, you must totally surrender to Jesus and control what you allow your mind to dwell on. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;Throw your net on the right side.....&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 21:6 NIV</span><br>Have you ever had an amazing day, a day when everything went right, when you were totally in the zone, a day you hoped would never end? And then you woke up the next morning and everything was plain and ordinary and boring again. Why is life like that? 
The four gospels all give us a different angle on the life of Jesus and, especially when it comes to the events after His resurrection, they all pick out different details we have to stitch together. We know this: Jesus rose from the dead, met Mary Magdalene first and later that day appeared to the 11 disciples. But then, maybe a week or so after that, they went back to what they were doing before they met Him: fishing. After something massive has happened we can crave the simplicity and security of what we know, we end up like the disciples: back at square one. 
But there's good news: If God called you, you're still called. Jesus shouts to the guys from the shore giving them identical instructions to the very first day He met them (Luke 5). Once again an ordinary day is touched with the extraordinary as Jesus steps into the scene. That morning Jesus ate breakfast with them, chatted with them, encouraged them and reminded them that they should always be ready to be interrupted by a visit from the Master. ]]></introtext>

4) Do what you've always done, get what you've always got. It takes more than personality and religious catch-phrases to set people free from illness; and this was a biggie! Sadly the disciples were powerless because they were prayerless. Jesus said: '...this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting' (Matthew 17:21 NAS). Persistent prayer is the price we pay for walking in power.  
5) Rise above the attitudes you see around you. Jesus confronted the core problem: '...&quot;O faithless...generation&quot;' (Matthew 17:17 NKJV). Now before you say 'That's a bit heavy JC!' just think, why should we act all wishy-washy in the face of a faithless generation moulded by godless media. If we let it, it will pull us down and wear us out. So we need to get tough. That day Jesus said, '&quot;If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move'&quot;...and it will move&quot;' (Matthew 17:20-21 NIV). Here's two final thoughts: a) 'If you have faith.' Everybody around you doesn't have to have faith in order for you to see miracles b) you don't have to be a spiritual giant; just use your ickle mustard-seed faith and God will move stuff for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Jesus took...Peter, James and John...up a high mountain...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 17:1 NIV</span><br>There's five things to look at in this story - we'll look at three today and two tomorrow: 
1) Not everybody gets to go up the mountain. Jesus didn't take everybody and He didn't explain or apologise to those disciples who stayed behind. He loves us all equally but He doesn't give us all the same experiences with Him. He knows what He's doing, so trust Him. 
2) Those who go up the mountain aren't more spiritual. After seeing Jesus glowing with God's glory, Peter blurted out, 'Let's build three tents and stay here.' Peter was keen, but a bit daft too. Learn from his mistake and shut up so you can listen what God has to say, then take steps to make sure you build your life on His Word. 
3) God's plan is to make Jesus famous, not you. 'While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, &quot;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him&quot;...When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus' (Matthew 17: 5-8 NIV). The number one challenge in your life is getting to the place where you focus on 'no one except Jesus.' The most important relationship you have is with Him and the only plan that will work out right is the one He gives you. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 8:4 NKJV</span><br>As we read through the New Testament we see the young church exploding with growth. They were obviously doing something right. Did they have great worship leaders that played guitars? Did they have nice buildings with comfy seats? Did they podcast their sermons around the world on iTunes? Actually, no to all those. The crazy thing is that the Bible shows us how it was in times of persecution (agro, intimidation, prejudice and violence) that the church grew most quickly. It's a powerful reminder that the bad times, not just the good ones, cause us to grow. 
Even though they don't know it some of the people who give you a hard time for being a Christian can help you out without even it. As you stand your ground your faith-muscle gets stronger. Like Joseph, you can look back years later and say, '...you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good...' (Genesis 50:20 NKJV). 
If God lets you to go through a tough time then it must be for your good or for the good of others through your example. Understanding this takes you deeper in your walk with God. So, whether the battle is over your family, your education, your health, or your friendships, expect three things: 
1) the closer you get to victory the more intense the battle; 2) what matters isn't your comfort but your calling; 3) God is totally on your side, so keep fighting!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...you will forget the shame of your youth...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 54:4 NKJV</span><br>Parents have 1001 ways of embarrassing their teenagers. It just comes naturally to them! The worst of them all is reserved for that special occasion when you bring your boyfriend or girlfriend round for the first time. It's all going really nicely and then it happens: 'Ooh, I bet you'd like to see some old pictures of...' ...and you can insert your name at the end of that sentence. The family photo album comes out and you wish the ground would swallow you up. 
The scary thing is, you've now entered a stage of life when for lots and lots of people, really big mistakes are made, really bad choices leading to all sorts of mess. Are you going to be a casualty or will you get through to adulthood with mind, body and spirit in good shape? Imagine 10 years from now looking back at a video of your teenage years - will it be embarrassing or will you be happy to let it be seen? Is today's Bible verse going to be something you need to reach for in the future or will you make sure that it doesn't apply to you? 
One thing's for sure, if you commit each day to God then the chances of you stuffing up are seriously reduced. So what are you waiting for; ask Him to show you which direction to go in today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;How many times shall I forgive?...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 18:21 NIV</span><br>In the book of Genesis Cain kills his brother Abel, but bizarrely God's judgment is to put a mark on him, saying that if anyone killed Cain they'd pay for it seven times over. Cain had a great-great grandson, called Lamech. One day somebody hurt Lamech, who then killed the guy, saying, 'I have killed a man for wounding me...If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times' (Genesis 4:23-24 NIV). In his mind he was absolutely justified. The guy who did him wrong, had it coming. The spirit of revenge is never satisfied. Simply stated: It doesn't work!
Fast forward to the New Testament, Peter had been hurt by someone close to him, and it happened more than once. So he went to Jesus and asked, 'How many times do I have to forgive? Seven times?' Peter thought he was being dead generous and expected Jesus to pat him on the back but Jesus deflated his ego by saying he must forgive the offender, 'not seven times, but seventy-seven times.' Where did Jesus get that number? From the Old Testament. Jesus knew the Scriptures well, so He chose it deliberately. He was tearing up the story of Lamech once and for all! So what about you; you can follow in the footsteps of Lamech and retaliate, or you can follow Jesus and keep extending forgiveness; but you can't do both!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...After the fire came a gentle whisper</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Kings 19:12 NIV</span><br>A respected author writes: 'I was driving a safe distance behind the car in front when the driver slammed on his brakes. I stopped short, but the car behind was too close and rammed into my Jeep. There was no real damage, but as I drove off something about the incident nagged at me. Weeks later I was on a fast-moving motorway. Behind me was a huge truck loaded with cars...in front were several cars...and up ahead, a school bus. Suddenly I noticed the brake lights from the cars ahead. The bus had stopped to let a child off. I pulled to a stop behind the car in front; then I remembered the lesson from the accident earlier. Sometimes I can stop safely, but the driver behind me can't. When I looked in my rear-view mirror the truck loaded with cars was frantically trying to stop. I pulled over, giving him an extra car length, and he screeched to a stop, right behind the car ahead of me. If I hadn't listened we'd all have piled up.'
There are often times when God gives us gentle checks, a little reminder or nudge that we should or shouldn't do something. Paying attention to these often tiny, split second decisions can end up changing the course of your life forever. So when you feel a tiny nudge, don't ignore it! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:22-23 NAS</span><br>Approachable people are like this: 1) Personal warmth; they actually like people. Ok, so some people are a nightmare, but the truth is that people suss out whether you like them or not. And if you're going to be approachable you need to learn to love people! 2) Their moods are consistent. How frustrating are moody people? You never know how they'll be. If you're moody, people will be scared to talk to you. 3) Sensitivity to people's feelings. Although approachable people are emotionally stable, they don't expect everyone to be that way. They recognise that good people have bad days; and act sensitively to that. 4) They understand human weakness, including their own. Don't be down on yourself, but be honest about your own weaknesses. When you're not trying to show people how fantastic you are and admit your struggles other people will be honest too. An old proverb says: 'Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves, for they shall never cease to be amused.' And because they can admit their own faults, they don't have a problem allowing other people to have faults as well. 5) The ability to forgive, and ask for forgiveness. Sometimes you screw up. Fact. We all do. So why do we often find it so hard to admit that? When you've messed up, say sorry. Get over yourself and ask for forgiveness. When you can do this other people will do it too. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But the fruit of the Spirit is... kindness, goodness... gentleness,</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:22-23 NKJV</span><br>Before we look at whether or not we're approachable, we've got to ask 'do we care?' After all, some of us quite like the idea that people are scared of us, or that we're 'well 'ard'. People like this don't tend to be very approachable, because you never know what response you're going to get! But is this really how you want people to see you? You might feel good thinking people are scared of you, but it's hard to make good friends. Let's take Jesus as an example. He was the ultimate hardman, and talk about scary; He was the Son of God AND could do pretty much anything He liked! Yet people flocked to Him in their thousands, His disciples never left his side. And why? It was because Jesus showed all the fruits of the Spirit. He was no walk over, yet He had so much compassion for people. When people were trying to kill Him, He fought back with love. He was kind, He loved kids, He was gentle and humble but at the same time He knew He was the Son of God. He knew He had the strength of Father God to draw on when He felt weak. Let's think about how we can model ourselves on Jesus today. We've the same Father God watching our back so drop the well 'ard act and do it, Jesus style!  ]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I will bless the Lord at all times...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 34:1 NKJV</span><br>David said, 'I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.' A thankful heart isn't always easy to have but it's defo better than being bitter and miserable, in fact it can save your life! When Jonah disobeyed God and ended up inside the whale, he told God, '...I will sacrifice to You with...thanksgiving...' (Jonah 2:9 NKJV). When he did, God made the fish spit him up on dry land. When you're down in the dumps and life's feeling rubbish, that's when you need to open your trap and praise God. Nothing shows trust like thanking God when life's smacking you round the head. This does two things:
1) It builds your faith. David said, '...magnify the Lord with me...' (Psalms 34:3). Picture a giant magnifying glass pointed at God. When you remember just how big God is, the problem becomes so tiny it's ridiculous! Plus, '...faith comes by hearing...the word of God' (Romans 10:17 NKJV). Hearing God's promises coming from your own lips, causes faith to rise in your heart. So start talking!
2) It restores life. Before raising Lazarus from the dead, Jesus looked up to heaven and said, '&quot;Father...thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me...&quot;' (John 11:41-42 NKJV). As soon as you thank God for stuff you're faith levels rocket, then the grey can turn to colour. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God is our refuge and strength...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 46:1 NIV</span><br>Yesterday we began to think a bit about the troubled world we live in. Terrorism, wars, hurricanes, tsunamis, crime, disease. Every night the media invades our homes bringing all this stuff to us in glorious Technicolor. The result is that our emotions can take a bit of a battering. Instead of having a true grasp of reality our minds start producing all sorts of worries about the future - what if we're next? In response to that the Bible says three things: 
1) 'God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.' When you're in a tight spot, God is totally available to help you. Read the whole Psalm - there's no catch, it doesn't say that God will help you occasionally or reluctantly. No, He's there for you, always. What more do you need? 
2) 'Therefore we will not fear' (v. 2 NIV). Don't panic, talk defeat, or give in to despair. A songwriter said, 'He's as close as the mention of his name.' Just breathe His name in prayer, and He'll be there for you. 
3) 'Before the rush and roar of oceans, the tremors that shift mountains' (v. 3 TM). When everything you once thought to be solid and dependable, is shaken to the core you'll be where you've always been; in the strong and loving arms of God; the One who's always available to help.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In every thing give thanks...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV</span><br>This time of year can be a real drag, can't it. You get up and leave the house in the morning... it's dark. You pack up to go home again later on in the afternoon... it's dark. And it's cold. Yep, this is the time of year when your mood can hit rock bottom and before you know it every other word off your lips is some kind of moan, groan or complaint. Well just be careful, if you let a bit of mouldy weather get you down what will you do when real hardship comes along? 
Joseph was people-trafficked by his own shady brothers! He couldn't possibly have known that God would turn their actions inside out and establish him as Prime Minister. Joe just had to take each day as it came 'making the most of every opportunity...' (Ephesians 5:16 NIV). And Joseph's not the only one, the Bible tells story after story where difficulty actually makes people stronger. Listen, there's a plan unfolding in your life, and it isn't affected by rain or snow or sleet or hail! Around this world there are some places that don't have a lot of God's kingdom happening, war zones, places of poverty, disaster sites. God loves the people in those places as much as he loves you and he needs people prepared to face the environments, that He might be glorified. So see this winter as a practice run! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 2:16 NKJV</span><br>OK, last day on Ruth. Let's keep going where we left off yesterday. Ruth, right in the middle of feeling loss, feeling hungry, feeling homesick, suddenly gets more than she ever needed dropped right into her lap. She didn't deserve it, didn't earn it, and couldn't even understand it. It's called grace; it's how God works!
But here's the health warning: If you're not used to being blessed it might not take long before it starts going to your head! That's why the Bible says: 'Remember that God, your God, gave you the strength to produce all this wealth' (Deuteronomy 8:18 TM).  And here's the small print (you should always read the small print!) God doesn't bless you so you can sit back and count your wads, or so you can strut around posing in all your bling. God's gifts are just tools to help you do His will. That's all that matters. At the end of the day what good is that stuff, if it takes you miles away from God? When God gives you something, He wants you to use it to make Him famous. So, when God gives you His blessings, be sure to read the instructions that go with them; only then will you find true fulfilment! So have you got it? God is the source of everything you have; and ever will have!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 2:3 NIV</span><br>Ruth had made a brave decision to travel with her mother-in-law to a place she didn't know. But now life was spiralling downward. Her husband was gone. Home was a long way away; there was no money in the bank. She was in survival mode which meant hanging around the fields picking up off-cuts from the harvest. Not a good look, ladies. 
Then God started turning things around. The guys cutting the harvest started dropping handfuls of barley in her path; undeserved blessings. Why? Because the boss (Boaz) saw Ruth hanging around and told his workers, 'leave them for her to pick up' (Ruth 2:16 NIV). Ruth had no idea that word had been spoken, she just started getting blessed! And you don't know what God will speak over your life. Suddenly everything can change! Doors can be opened, mountains can be moved. What's happening? Your steps are being ordered by the Lord (Psalm 37:23). And you don't even have to worry about somebody else getting what's yours, because nobody can pick it up except you; the boss says so! 
The minute the boss started showing favour to her, Ruth's downward spiral was over. She came from the fringes to the foreground. Instead of only looking forward to off-cuts she got the cream of the crop. When God speaks, that can happen very quickly. So be ready!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...Where you go I will go...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 1:16 NIV</span><br>Ruth told Naomi, 'Where you go I will go.' Relationships are weird. Suddenly you can meet someone and 'tzzzzt' - there's an electric connection between you. It's what made Elisha quit farming and follow Elijah, a prophet with self-esteem issues; it's why Timothy hung out with Paul, an old man with a habit of getting into fights. You know instantly, 'I won't reach my destiny without you in my life.' Looking back you realise if you hadn't met that certain person, you wouldn't be where you are today. 
On the other hand, 'Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye' (Ruth 1:14 NIV). Now Orpah's leaving didn't make her a bad person; it just meant her part in the story was over. Listen, you need to learn to recognise when somebody's part in your story is over, otherwise you'll just drive each other nuts. Yep, it can be hard to admit something is over, especially a relationship. Look, if God wants that for you He'll make it work. But if it blatantly ain't working then accept His will in the matter. Get up, go outside, put one foot in front of the other and start living again! Never beg anyone to stay with you against their will. Their leaving is no accident; it just means God has something better in store for you (and possibly them too), so trust Him and move on!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 1:5 NIV</span><br>When hers sons died, Naomi experienced a unique bonding process with her daughters-in-law, Ruth and Orpah, who (obviously) had lost their husbands. Unless you've been through something like it, it's hard to understand that kind of bond. Tragedy can bring together the oddest people. When you're hurting, don't look for support from people based on what they look like or where they live. All you want is someone who's been there themselves, someone who really knows what you're going through. People can't give you what they don't have. 
The old preacher Charles Spurgeon gets at this issue using the image of soldiers returning from battle, 'Just as old soldiers compare stories and scars, when we arrive at our heavenly home we'll tell of the faithfulness of God Who brought us through. I wouldn't like to be pointed out as the only one who never experienced sorrow, or feel like a stranger in the midst of that sacred fellowship. Therefore be content to share in the battle, for soon we will wear the crown.' 
So if you're fighting just to get through another day, remind yourself that you aren't the first and you won't be the last to do so. Like Naomi, God sees what you're going through and has plans for your life yet to be revealed. Be encouraged. You will gain through your pain. Hold on to His hand; He'll bring you through this!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 1:21 NIV</span><br>When it comes to valuable life-lessons, the book of Ruth is right up there. For the next few days we're gonna dig into it... 
When famine came to Bethlehem, Naomi, her husband and two sons moved to Moab where the economy was thriving. What they hoped would be a short stay turned into ten years. The lads married two local girls, Ruth and Orpah. Then the unthinkable happened; Naomi's husband and both sons died! As you might expect she was absolutely gutted. She heard that things were back on the up in Bethlehem so she decided to go home. After arriving back safely she said, 'I went out full, and the Lord has brought me home again empty' (NKJV). She was choking on the irony that she'd left a land of nothing for a land of plenty and come back with even less than she set out with. 
The truth is, you can be blessed and not know it. You never miss the water till the tap runs dry! Only as you look back do you realise that what you have is much more important than the things you don't have. Have you been saying, 'I'll be happy when...'? Forget it, happiness doesn't come from getting what you want, it comes from appreciating what God's given you. So take a few minutes today to put down that wish list and just say some simple thank yous. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I came so they can have real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 10:10 TM</span><br>Living your fullest life needs help from two places: the inside and the outside. 
1) The Inside: You need to be able to dig deep and to how to go the extra mile. Yep, that means extra effort and extra time. Mega business dude Andrew Carnegie had this sussed and was fond of saying, 'There's no use in trying to help people who won't help themselves. You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless he or she is first willing to climb it.' The apostle Paul puts it like this: 'each one should carry his own load' (Galatians 6:5).
2) The Outside: You need to be teachable, open to other people whom God brings along to input into your development. This isn't just a good idea, it's a God idea; called discipleship, or basically, mentoring. Good mentors lead by example; they know that to have influence they first need your respect. They treat you as an individual understanding your strengths and weaknesses. They notice whether you're right-brained (creative) or left-brained (methodical). They find out whether you learn visually or verbally. They know when you need a pat on the back or a kick in the butt! They're someone who, like the apostle Paul, can say 'Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' (1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV) If you can get a mentor you'll be well blessed. So don't hang about, ask God to bring you one!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I coveted them and took them...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 7:21 NIV</span><br>Christmas was three weeks ago now and all of a sudden those trainers you thought were the bomb as you tucked into your turkey feel pretty sad compared to the new style that's just been released. Or what about that new mobile you mithered for months about? Yeah, you were well happy with it until first day back when you found out she had one too! If that sounds a bit like you then you need to pay attention today because it sounds like 'stuff' has got a hold of you. 
There's a story from the book of Joshua about the time when things started going wrong for Israel; they started losing battles. Joshua asked God why and God said it was because there was sin in the camp. When Joshua started doing a bit of detective work one of his soldiers, confessed, 'While we were in Jericho, I saw a beautiful Babylonian robe... and a gold bar... I wanted them for myself, so I took them.' At the end of the story it cost the guy his life and the lives of his family. 
When you get jealous about stuff you're basically putting something else in the place of God. If you think you really do need (not just want) something, pray about it and trust God to give it to you! In the meantime be grateful for what He's already given you.

<title><![CDATA[Control your anger (2) ]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 37:8 NIV</span><br>A bad temper is not something to be proud of, but prayed over. When you blow your top, you just reveal your contents. And which of us hasn't done that, and regretted it? Here's three ways to get your lid firmly back on! 
1) Less is more: By cramming too much stuff into too little time, you wind yourself up! Like violin strings that are pulled too tight, you end up snapping, then feeling guilty because you're not 'spiritual' enough. 'Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.' (Romans 12:3-4 NIV). 
2) Don't be a hammer: If you want to get on in life you'll need to tackle different problems in different ways. People whose only tool is a hammer have got no choice but to treat every problem like a nail. Before long they've got holes all over the house, so put the hammer (anger) down! You know, the bible describes 9 different fruit of the spirit but not one of them is anger (see Galatians 5:22) 
3) What's the point: Sometimes 'enough is enough' and you need to speak up. When Jesus got angry in the temple he had a point because poor people were being ripped off and he was drawing attention to it. In this case, '...if you know the right thing to do and don't do it, that, for you, is evil' (James 4:17 TM).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In your anger do not sin.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:26 NIV</span><br>Everyone, except the emotionally disturbed, likes to think of themselves as deep-down basically an OK person. And most people are, until they get angry. You see, anger dissolves personality. Anger is that it brews and festers invisibly waiting for its moment and then - KABOOM! The nicest, sweetest people can explode in a ball of rage. It ain't pretty! 
So what if that's you? Or maybe you've not exploded yet but you can feel your fuse burning shorter and shorter. Listen to what Paul says: 'In your anger do not sin.' (NIV). Does that mean it's always bad to get mad? No, Paul is making the point that we can't help things happening that stir us to feeling angry, but we have a choice not to let that anger lead to sin. You can scream something really hurtful and nasty at your sister / brother / mum / dad (or whoever) or you can let off steam in your bedroom by screaming into your pillow! One of those things is OK by God and the other isn't! 
Sometimes we're angry because we think people don't appreciate us, or take advantage of us. Again Paul writes: 'Get rid of all...anger...forgiving each other...as...God forgave you' (Ephesians 4:31-32 NIV). So, if you're inclined to be hot-tempered, ask God now to remind you of all the times He's forgiven you. It's a great way to cool off  ;-) [KMP1]  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...to depart and be with Christ...is far better.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 1:23 NKJV</span><br>A kid wrote a letter to God, addressed it to heaven and posted it. Letters like that usually end up in the bin in the corner of the Post Office, but somehow this one was opened. It read, 'Dear God, what's it like to die? I don't want to do it, I just want to know. Your friend, Michael.' It's a big question that lots of Christians have spent a very long time thinking about. 
Harold Sala sees it like this: 'When I'm going to a part of the world I've never been to, I read and investigate to find out what it's like. I browse travel books, go on the Internet, talk with someone who can tell me what it's like from personal experience. No other book in the world can tell me what the Bible tells me about heaven. The only person who has been there and can tell me what it's like, is Jesus.' At the end of the final Narnia book The Last Battle, the characters die in a train accident and CS Lewis wraps up the story like this: 'The things that [happened] after that were so beautiful I cannot write them. For us this is the end of all the stories, but for them it was only the beginning of the real story.' 
But we'll leave the last word to the Apostle Paul: '...we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven...' (2 Corinthians 5:1). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...speaking the truth in love, we will...grow up...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:15 NIV</span><br>There are two ways to tell the truth. The 'give them a piece of your mind' style, which only makes things worse, or God's way: 'Speaking the truth in love.'
Suppose a couple always argue because he's always late. How can she get her message heard by 'speaking the truth in love'? Here's a five possible ways: 
She could say to him: 1) 'I feel frustrated.' No blame, no attack; just an honest expression of her own emotion 2) 'When you are late.' No judging or name-calling, just a description of reality 3) 'It seems to say to me that my time is not really important to you.' Sharing how it looks from her point of view  4) 'Please try to be on time, or call and let me know when you'll be here.' Instead of focusing on the past (which nobody can change), she's telling him what she'd like him to do differently next time 5) 'Would you like me to do that to you?' This final option is drawing him out of his own little world and into hers. 
At the end of the day, there's always a whole load of ways to say what needs to be said and maturity is being aware of the options and choosing the right one at the right time. Question is, are you gonna try it? Who's your guinea pig going to be?  ]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 10:24 NIV</span><br>Let's be honest, selfishness is a battle we fight daily. But it's a battle we've got to keep fighting. Left to get out of control selfishness will gradually dissolve your personality from the inside out. Thankfully the Bible is full of amazing examples to keep us focused: Paul and Silas were beat up and thrown in the cells but they still found the strength to minister to their jailer (Acts 16:32). When young Stephen was being stoned to death, he prayed for those who were killing him, 'do not hold this sin against them' (Acts 7:59-60). And of course the ultimate example, when Jesus was hanging on the cross in intense pain, He took time for a condemned criminal hanging next to Him (Luke 23:39-43). 
How tempting it must have been for all these heroes to just think about themselves; they had every excuse, but their acts of love brought the fragrance of heaven down to earth.
When we begin to win the war against selfishness and walk in love, people will take notice; it's totally opposite to the way of the world. And let's remember, we'll never win the world by being like the world! So here's the question you need to answer: How many people might come to know Jesus if you could get your eyes off yourself and start paying attention to what they're going through? It's time to find out!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Put yourself aside, and help others get ahead.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:4 TM</span><br>Do you want to know what God's plan for your life is, in one sentence? OK, here it is: God wants to make you a channel through which His blessings flow to others. That's it. Finito. What more do you need to know? 
Well, most people aren't satisfied with just knowing that. We're curious; we want to ask more questions, the most obvious one being: 'How?' God's cool with us asking those sort of questions because questioning is a great way to get to know Him better. King David asked those kinds of questions a lot, 'Show me your ways, O Lord...' (Psalm 24:4). When we ask God questions, He is less concerned with the question and more concerned with the attitude with which we ask it. When we read about the life of Jesus in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John we see that He was always being asked questions, some easy, some hard. The way He responded very often depended on what was in the heart of the one doing the asking. Were they after a Word to help them get ahead or were they wanting to learn about how to truly live for God?   
So what's in your heart today? Are you ready for God to show you His ways; that always lead to others being blessed, or are you secretly hoping that you'll be able to keep the blessing for yourself? ]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...each according to his ability.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 25:15 NIV</span><br>One of the stories Jesus tells is a bit like the TV programme Dragon's Den; it's all about investing in people who've got ideas about how to turn a little into a lot. In Jesus' story though there's only one dragon who decides to invest money in three different people. They weren't all given the same amount, they were given, 'each according to his ability.' As the story unfolds we are impacted by a scary truth: God only gives what you have the ability to handle. Why is that scary? Because it means if you don't make the most of what God gives you it's not like you can go back to Him making excuses like, 'Well, I got the jitters so I decided to do nothing.' That won't wash. It's tough but it is the truth at the heart of this story. The first guy doubled his. The second did the same. They both got big fat promotions as a reward. But the third caved in to fear and buried his cash in a hole. What did he get in return for that? He got his butt kicked that's what. Message? When you fail to use what God gives you, He's not impressed and you lose the rewards you would have enjoyed.
Listen, fear of failure is not of God. That's why you need to ask Him for the gift of faith; today and every day. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I want to know Christ...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:10 NIV</span><br>What's the most impressively powerful thing on the planet? A rocket blasting off into space? A nuclear reactor exploding atoms deep underground? Paul writes: 'I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.' Resurrection Power. The power that raised Jesus from the dead. That's truly impressive. Who else can do that! Think: what problem or need do you face that resurrection power can't handle? What's dead in your life that needs to be raised? So how can you touch this power without just melting or exploding in the process? The answer is right there, 'That I may know Him.' When you make intimacy with Jesus your top priority, you tap into His power. 
But a lot of us would like to put a full stop after the words, 'The power of His resurrection.' If we do we're stuffed. If we're going to know Jesus intimately we must also know Him in 'the fellowship of His sufferings.' Depressed yet? Yep, 'sufferings' means more than just putting up with bad hay fever or having to share your room with your little sister. For Paul it meant being beaten to a pulp and locked in jail! But it all created a special kind of friendship with Jesus that's impossible any other way. Think about it, what kind of friend say, 'I only want to share the good times with you, keep your suffering to yourself.' Getting the idea?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...we were...chosen...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:11 NIV</span><br>One of the impossible mysteries of God is how He can know all about our life and how it will unfold even though He has blessed us with free will to make whatever choices we want. It's mind boggling! The Message version of the Bible puts it this way: 'He had his eye on us, had designs on us for glorious living, part of the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone.' Within that purpose God knows the things (and people!) you'll be attracted to and also the things (and people again!) that you'll want to run from! 
When Jonah tried to run from God and go to Tarshish, God loved him too much to let him escape his destiny so He sent a storm to wreck the boat and get Jonah back on track. Jonah was squeezed into a desperate place of prayer and then God answered him, by sending him off to his original destination. And God loves you too; much too much to let you escape His plans for you. God has too much invested in you to let you get away. If you have to leave behind a relationship, or an addiction, or a selfish dream, you'll come. Why? Because the echo of God's voice deep in your heart will never go silent. 
So, for your own good, make up your mind to follow Him today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:3-4 NIV</span><br>People will often say that relationships are more important to them than anything else, but their actions don't show it. How about you? Relationships are living things and like any living thing if you don't feed and protect them, they will die. While things are going well we can take the people close to us for granted, then a crisis comes along to remind us how valuable the people in our lives are. 
One author writes: 'The Intensive Care waiting room is different from any other place in the world. And the people who wait are different. They can't do enough for each other. No one is rude. The distinctions of race and class melt away. The garbage man loves his wife as much as the university professor loves his, and everyone understands this. Each person pulls for everyone else. In the Intensive Care waiting room the world changes. Vanity and pretence vanish. The universe is focused on the doctor's next report. If only it will show improvement. Everyone knows that loving someone else is what life is all about. Could we learn to love like that, if we realised that every day of life, is like a day in the Intensive Care waiting room?'
The apostle Paul says, '...if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing' (1 Corinthians 13:2 NIV). He's absolutely right isn't he?!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>All Scripture is... profitable...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 3:16 NKJV</span><br>It's the 7th of January. By now, all that's left of that massive tin of Quality Streets your Gran brought round for Christmas are about a dozen of those Toffee Pennies; the round ones in the gold wrappers. Who put them in there? They don't even have chocolate on! We all have our favourites; the shiny green triangles, the strawberry creams, those crunchy ones in the blue wrapper. But be careful; don't go treating the Bible like a tin of Quality Street. You can't just pick the bits you like and leave out all the rest. To grow in your faith you need to take in all the different tastes of God's Word because 'all Scripture is... profitable...' (2 Timothy 3:16 NKJV). To make a profit in business you have to know your business inside out, otherwise you'll soon be out of business. To get on in your Christian life, make it your business to know your Bible. 
There's nothing like just setting aside half an hour to get into your Bible. Without it you won't be able to hear what God is saying to you. You'll always have to depend on somebody else. Imagine dealing with your mates on that basis, never bothering to listen to a word they say? How long do you think your friendships would last? The same is true with God, so put down your W4U2D and open your Bible... now. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Lord, if it's you...tell me...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 14:28 NIV</span><br>One of the most famous Jesus-stories is the one when He walked on the water to His disciples in the boat. Gobby Peter shouted out, 'Lord, if it's you...tell me...' (Matthew 14:28 NIV). Jesus gave him one word, 'Come,' and with that Peter hopped over the side of the boat and started walking! Was he scared? Wouldn't you be? Ice skating is hard enough but how the heck do you stand up when the water's still wet and wobbly!  But Peter's desire was greater than his fear. And that's all you need to get started, a desire for God that's bigger than your doubts. 
There's another detail in this story we should note: The disciples didn't exactly back Peter up in his surfing-without-a-surfboard experiment! So bear in mind that when God gives you a Word and you step out in response to it, not everybody will cheer and shout out encouragements. It's normal for you to want people to see what you see and believe what you believe. But if you're not careful, people's opinions will short-circuit your faith and make you doubt what God has said. God says: 'I'm not going to confirm what I've told you through them. In fact, I don't even need them to agree with what I've spoken concerning you.' Relax. You may want your mates to back you up, but the truth is, Jesus is all you need!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...receive...the engrafted word...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:21 KJV</span><br>Have you ever turned on the telly and caught a few minutes of any of those gardening programmes? Yes, it is a bit baffling how people can get so excited about borders and rockeries. But if you're going to understand some of the things in the Bible you'll need to know a bit about gardening; Eden, home of the first people is a pretty big clue that God is into gardens. 
Today's verse is a gardening image. In some translations of the Bible the word 'planted' is used but the original word is actually 'grafted' or 'engrafted' which is when a gardener carefully slices a branch off one tree and then transplants it into a hole he's made in a branch of another tree. From then on the branch that's been relocated starts receiving all its water and life from the new tree. 
Now let's get creative, picture yourself reading your Bible, and as you do, those words from God are becoming attached to you, they start growing in you and producing fruit in your life. That's how God's Word works, and that's why you need to read it every day. As God's Word actually becomes part of who you are, you will find that it frees you from fear, lifts you when you're low, directs you the way to go, and gives you the strength to fight and win. 
So, how do you feel about gardening now? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 14:25 NIV</span><br>Night time is when God does some of His best work! It's mentioned in loads of Bible stories, like when the Israelites faced the Red Sea, '...all that night the LORD drove the sea back' (Exodus 14:21 NIV), also, during 'the middle watch' of the night, Gideon defeated the Midianites (Judges 7:19-24), and let's not forget, Jesus rose from the dead before 'daybreak' (Matthew 28:1). 
Matthew says: '...in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea. When the disciples saw Him ...they were terrified...immediately Jesus spoke...&quot;Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid&quot;' (Matthew 14:25-27 NAS). The 'fourth watch' mentioned here is from 3:00 a.m. 'til 6:00 a.m. Check these two things out: 1) Jesus waited until the storm was so bad that the disciples had lost all hope. That's because God decides the timetable for our rescue, and He's never late 2) the disciples didn't recognise Jesus until He shouted to them. Often the answer you need is right beside you, but you can't hear it because of all the other chaos you're paying attention to. 
So now we know this what should we do with it? The answer is simply this: to know that in life there are dark times, guaranteed, but that doesn't matter one bit to God, '...to you; the night will shine like the day...' (Psalm 139:12 NIV). He's always ready and able to save. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I will put my laws in their hearts...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 10:16 NIV</span><br>Take a survey in the street and you will not find anyone who likes being called a dog. Yes, you might find plenty of pooch lovers but they won't appreciate you saying they might be a bit canine themselves! One of the amazing things about dogs is that they can understand human language; but only in a very limited way: Sit! Fetch! Heel! So if we're so much smarter than Rover and Fido why do so many of us have that sort of Christian life? Following Jesus gets reduced to: 'Stop that; come back here; don't do that,' and don't forget the classics: 'Read your Bible; pray; go to church; pay your tithes; witness.' Now, this is all stuff we should be doing, but God never meant us to do them at the end of a lead! 
Let's listen to what the Bible says on the matter: 'But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. (Rom 7:6 NIV) and repeats this again elsewhere saying: '...I will put my laws in their hearts...' (Heb 10:16 NIV). The point is quite clear: living life as a Christian is about changing first on the inside, the heart, so that works its way outside in your behaviour. Trying to keep to an external system of rules is a dog's life!   ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the LORD your God has blessed you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 16:17 (NIV)</span><br>The award-winning film Schindler's List, is the story of one man's efforts to bring hope in a desperate situation. As the boss of a factory in Germany, Oskar Schindler decides to use his position to save lives. By employing Jews from the concentration camp in his factory, Oskar rescues them from the gas chambers. But it's expensive, so he starts selling his personal possessions in order to keep the business afloat. 
At the end of the story the Nazis are defeated and the full impact of Oskar's effort is revealed as the dead are counted and the living stagger back to freedom. But kneeling by the railway tracks that carried thousands of Jews to their death, Oskar realises he could have saved more. Overwhelmed with regret, he thinks of the few goods still remaining in his possession; what else could he have sold to save a life? But it was too late. Yes, Schindler was a hero. But interestingly, all he could think about was what he didn't do. He wished he had done more. 
We learn a powerful lesson about giving from this man; if even generous givers look back on their lives and wish they'd done more what about those who never gave at all, or gave less than they could, what will say when they stand before God? 
OK, Christmas is over, but that doesn't mean the giving stops.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you enter a house, first say, &quot;Peace to this house.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 10:5 NIV</span><br>New Year's Eve has the reputation of being the maddest night of the year. Up and down the country and around the world, on New Years Eve people are going nuts; and often sadly ending up in a right state in the process. But have you ever been out and about on the morning of New Year's Day? (If you're reading this and it's still before 10 o'clock you might want to try it) It is deathly quiet. There's hardly anyone around. It's probably the most peaceful morning of the whole year. 
When Jesus sent out 72 of His followers to go and take the good news of salvation to the towns of Galilee He told them to find a 'person of peace' and stay at their house, saying 'Peace to this house'. But what did He mean? Did He just want the disciples to have a nice, quiet place to stay? Well, to understand what He meant we need a deeper understanding of the word 'peace'. In Hebrew it is 'shalom' which is a deep emotional word meaning 'Nothing missing, nothing broken'. It is about wholeness, completeness, wellbeing. That's what Jesus was all about; bringing God's shalom to a broken and hurting world. 
And just like He sent out the 72, He wants to send you too. Will you be one of His shalom-bringers this year? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I no longer live but Christ lives in me...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:20 NIV</span><br>It's your last chance to think up some New Year's resolutions! Have you ever wondered why we do that? Is it to impress friends? To try and be a better, nicer person? Because you think people expect you to? And do you ever actually manage to keep them all?!? How long do you think it'll be before you break any in 2009? 
Hebrews 12 urges us to keep striving, while Romans 3:23 reminds us that we're all going to slip up; so why bother?! Which one do we pay attention to? Our word for today, Galatians 2:20, goes on to say that God loves you and gave Himself for you. Think about that for a minute - it's a pretty huge thing! Verse 21 says that we can never get to a point of supreme goodness by effort. So that means no matter how many resolutions we keep, we'll never reach perfection. But that is why Jesus died for you - so that unreachable goal is brought right to us. 
So although resolutions aren't the be-all and end-all at New Year, if you remember how amazing it is that God gave Himself for us, and that we have Christ in us to help us, you might find it easier to do the right thing, for the right reasons, whatever your resolutions. And when you find it hard going, you know on whom you can call for help!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Daniel 3:30 NIV</span><br>We can learn a few things from those guys in the fiery furnace: 
1) Obeying God doesn't mean you'll never have trouble. Don't expect the world to always get you - sometimes, it'll be hard work for you 2) You're not alone, God is with you in your trouble. If you've ever seen the Veggietales 'Rack, Shack and Benny', you'll remember that when King Neb threw them in the fire, suddenly there were 'four men, and one was reeeaaal shiny!' (check out the whole story in Daniel 3:19 - 27). The fire didn't kill them, 'cos Jesus was there too. So be encouraged. It may feel like you're stuck in the flames, but God is with you - He'll bring you out of this victorious. 3) Your trouble will become your testimony. Your mates are watching. When what they're trusting in doesn't work, they'll look to see if what you're trusting in does. Your faithfulness to God and His to you, will challenge them in ways nothing else can. Everybody in Babylon knew what Rack, Shack and Benny believed, but they wanted to know if it worked when the heat was on (literally!). It did, and lives changed!  4) On the other side of your trouble, there's great blessing. Our word for today is a Scriptural principle: when you're faithful in a tough place, God can trust you in a high place.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 10:4 NIV</span><br>Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft (and the world's richest man), was asked about his success, and offered some insights to anyone starting out. He makes a lot of sense! 
1) Life isn't fair - get used to it 2) The world doesn't care about your self-esteem; it expects you to accomplish first, feel good second 3) You won't make £30K a year right out of school, or be a Company Director. You have to earn it 4) Do you think your teacher is tough? Wait till you have a boss - he's worse! 5) Flipping burgers isn't beneath you; it's opportunity 6) Some schools may have abolished winners and losers, but life hasn't. They may have eradicated 'failing grades' and given you as long as you want to get the right answer. This bears no resemblance to reality 7) Life isn't divided into terms. You don't get summers off. Employers aren't interested in helping you 'find yourself;' you do that on your own time 8) Be nice to nerds; chances are, you'll end up working for one someday! 
OK - it's not gospel but it's useful advice  ;-) 
The writer of Proverbs sussed this a long time before Bill Gates did: 'Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper' (Proverbs 13:4 NIV). So don't try and take shortcuts in life - you've got to work for it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...that in the coming ages he might show...his grace, expressed...to us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 2:7 NIV</span><br>Whatever you're going through right now is important. God wants to use it to help shape your future. God doesn't measure us in terms of what we're doing now, or how we feel. No, He's got a much greater plan in mind. Read Romans 8:29. Thousands of years ago, God knew you; and one day, your character will be just like Jesus'. Doesn't that blow your mind? God is going to put us on display and say, 'Look at My workmanship. Can you believe that I made these awesome creatures from clay? When I first scooped them off the ground they wouldn't hold water. But I worked with them, moulded them and raised them up until they held relationships and jobs. What you heard about them was true. They were a disgrace and a disaster, but My grace was sufficient. Now they will sit with Me, ruling and reigning for ever!' 
People think that Houdini and David Blaine performed the impossible; but when it comes to that, they were amateurs. Could they have split an ocean down the middle, caused an eclipse for 24 hours, turned water into wine, resurrected the dead, and done it all with such style? Well, guess what? That same God is at work in your life, and He plans to show you off some day. Incredible as it may sound, when God gets through with you, you'll be 'something else.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If you bite and ravage each other, watch out-in no time at all you will be annihilating each other..</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:15 NIV</span><br>You know what it's like; your 'so called friend' says something or does something, so 'bang out of order' that in an instant, you decide they are no longer your friend. Or your boyfriend/ girlfriend goes from being your soul mate to a 'so over mate' when they do or say something that makes you wonder what you ever saw in them in the first place! Aaggh! Well that's the way it's got to be right? You can't just let them humiliate you like that, you can't let them walk over you, you've got to stick up for yourself, and you don't care anyway, there's plenty more friends you can make, there's plenty other hunks / babes you can date...Right? Or is it?                                                      
God knows how people let us down and hurt us, which makes us, want to lash out. But God says 'whoa hang on a minute! You keep lashing out at each other like that and it won't help you, it will destroy you!'   We need to learn to fight right!  Fight to make your relationships work - not end! Fight to do things God's way not your way! Jesus said, '&quot;...I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.&quot;' (John 10:10). So if you want to live your life to the Max, want to get the very best out of life, then fight right!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He will reply, &quot;I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these; you did not do for me.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 25: 45 NIV</span><br>No, it's not a day to celebrate the talents of Amir Khan or other incredible sportsman in the world of boxing!  No it's not an excuse for you to belt your brother to bits or punch your sister's lights out! At one time, Boxing Day was a day to open 'Christmas boxes' and share the contents with the poor. These boxes were wooden or clay containers where people placed gifts throughout the year; you'd see them on ships, in churches or in factories.  What's happened? What do we do today? - Hit the shops to find the latest bargains! Go watch the football! Overeat AGAIN in front of the TV! It's not about helping those in need. It's about getting what we want; take take, take, me, me, me! This isn't Jesus; idea of Boxing Day!  In today's reading Jesus tells a story that lets us know that He wants us to help people; anyone and everyone who needs it! Life's not about 'What can I get for me?' but 'How can I help?' Listen '...&quot;Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?&quot; He will reply, &quot;I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.&quot;' Ouch! Jesus says that not helping others means we do not love Him.  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 2:11 NIV</span><br>Imagine today is your birthday, a very special significant birthday, like your 18th, and you wake up SO excited! You've been waiting for this day for what seems like forever and now at last it's here. You can hardly believe it! You have a smile on your face that stretches as wide as is possible. Today just feels like the best day ever and you can't wait to get up and celebrate. You have big plans, big hopes for this day. You race down stairs to receive great cards and presents from your family, before going out to receive even more from your friends. You're even looking forward to terrible renditions of Happy Birthday!  But instead, the smile on your face begins to fade, as all your hopes for the day start to disappear. You see no-one is interested in you today, there's no cards, presents, singing; not even a text message...it's as if you don't exist! You want to scream at the top of your voice 'Hey it's me, it's my birthday, this day is special, celebrate with me!' But you know there's no point. No-one cares, no-one's listening, they're all doing their own thing!  What a nightmare that would be!  Today is a special day! It's the day set aside to remember that Jesus was born. He is your Saviour ...don't treat Him today like He doesn't exist.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 37:7 ESV</span><br>Waiting! Not many of us enjoy waiting do we? Waiting for the bus to come, school to finish, or even for the microwave to warm up our leftover pizza. We don't want to wait do we? It's hard. When we want something we want it NOW!!!. 'Hurry up!' we shout at our friend who's late or the shop assistant who's serving. Just hurry up!! 
It's Christmas Eve and everyone's waiting for Christmas Day. Are you one of those people who can't wait to see their presents so has already found them and even opened a few? It can be hard to wait. But the Bible tells us to 'Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him'. Waiting for God patiently, not screaming at Him to hurry up but patiently waiting, being still; listening for God, not rushing ahead of Him.
It can be hard to wait! When we want something to happen and nothing is changing, it can be so tempting for us to try and make that change ourselves. 
Recently a little girl died, because a cyclist couldn't wait for her to move out his way, he ploughed into her, knocking her to the floor, unconscious. Days later she was dead. 
It's important to wait. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. Ask God, today, to give you the patience to wait when you need to. To do things in His time not yours.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He who guards his lips guards his life...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 13:3 NIV</span><br>Paul Galvin's business had gone bust. He went to the auction of his own company, and with his last $750 he bought back the department which later became Motorola! He was 'down' but definitely not 'out!'  'When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.' (Ecclesiastes 7:14 NIV)
'Good times' can be less helpful than 'tough times'; and the 'hard times' can be better for you than the 'easy times'. Whatever changes and challenges come your way; whether planned or unexpected, whether you feel like your going forward or sliding backwards - God is waiting for you to turn to him and know him.  'If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously...' (James 1:5 NIV) 'Ask and it will be given to you...' (Matthew 7:7 NIV). And there's more; God can make you a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), give you strength (Isaiah 40:31), guide and comfort you (Psalm 23).  'You will have to live with the consequences of everything you say'. Proverbs 18:20 reminds us that, for better or for worse, repeated actions create behaviours, behaviours create character and character creates a destiny.  So make sure you are careful, with an attitude like the Israelites of Deuteronomy 11:18, and protect your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...he who invokes a blessing on himself...shall do so by saying, May the God of truth...bless me...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 65:16 AMP</span><br>Words are powerful things. From 'God said' in creation, to God's Word being a sword in Ephesians 6:17. Words can change things big time. When Christiano Ronaldo was being pushed off the ball as a five year old, or when Leona Lewis was queuing up with thousands of hopefuls on X-Factor and told she'd have no chance, did they give up? No!  Read Isaiah 65:15, and you'll see that:  a) you must rise above what others might say to you (in words or actions)   b) there is power in what you say to yourself.
In a way, rising above what others say is the easier of those two points. Follow Ronaldo and Leona's example, and filter those put downs from others. And then get tough on what about what you're saying to yourself; don't ever run yourself down. Instead read the Bible out loud to yourself and pray God's promises into your life. Go on; start now! The more time you spend hanging out with God and reading His love-letter to you, the more it'll change how you see the people and situations around you, and even how you view yourself. 
Your mouth, your body and your brain are precious to God - so take care of them (check out 1 Corinthian 3:16 and Ephesians 4:29) and let God use them to take care of you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Love others as well as you love yourself.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 22:39 TM</span><br>Do you ever look around at everyone, and think they're so much better than you? Your mates have the looks of the cast of High School Musical, the charisma of Ant and Dec and the wit of Peter Kaye; whereas you feel like you have the looks of Shrek and the personality of a broom handle? Don't be so down on yourself! Not only are you being unfair to yourself, but with an attitude like that, you can't love others as God wants you to. You're the one person you can never get away from, so unless you learn to love and accept yourself, you'll probably end up miserable; which no-one wants. The devil loves any opportunities to 'prowl[] around...looking for someone to devour' (1 Peter 5:8 NIV), so don't give him that pleasure by sitting around moping. Stamp on his head and tell him to get lost, and start to think positively about yourself! Read about what God has to say about you (Isaiah 43:4 is a good place to start). When you can see good stuff in you, that's evidence that God is at work in you. Yes, the Bible cautions us about having an over inflated opinion of ourselves - but don't go to the other extreme! Check out 2 Corinthians 4:7. Recognise God's treasure in you, and the potential you have, and run with it. Go on; love yourself!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...you have taken off your old self...and have put on the new self...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 3:9-10 NIV</span><br>Have you ever spent ages getting ready in the morning; slapping on that makeup, or spiking up your hair? Making sure you look the best you can, so you can impress that guy or girl that you fancy? I bet you wouldn't dream of letting them see you not looking your best; so why should it be any different with God? Don't settle for letting Him see you looking second best. Look in the mirror at the reflection of your heart and your mind and see what God sees. Ask yourself, are your attitudes and behaviours what you want God to be seeing? If not, then you need to think about changing them. How? By taking off the old, chucking it away, and putting on the new. Your focus each day must be to 'Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature' (Romans 13:14 NIV). It's your choice, and only you can make that change. He's not going to force you to. 
The devil aint gonna like you making that change, and he's gonna do what he can to stop you; so expect it to be tough, but stick with it. That's why you need to get on your knees and ask God to help you keep off those old 'clothes', and stick with the new.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Bring...(the whole tenth of your income)...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Malachi 3:10 AMP</span><br>Before you skip today's reading thinking it's not for you, just stop and think. Do you get pocket money or an allowance, ever get paid to babysit your little sister, do odd jobs around the house, or have a Saturday job? Yes? Then this IS for you. No? Read it anyway, 'cos one day soon it will be! 
'Tithing' means giving God back some of your money. How's that fair, 'cos it's your money isn't it? Well, no, not really! Everything we have is ours thanks to God. He gives us everything we need. The Bible says we should give back at least 10%; which may seem a lot, but just remember, it was His to start with! We're also told to give the first 10%; that means before anything else, not after you've got that new top or DVD you've been wanting for ages! 
Giving God the first tenth of whatever 'income' you have shows Him that He's first in your life. God promises two things to those who tithe: His blessing and His protection. By tithing, you're partnering with God. He'll bless you back more than you could ever bless Him, and He'll protect you when the devil tries to attack you financially. 
So get into good habits now; it'll make it much easier to stick to in the future. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Love the Lord your God with all your heart...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV</span><br>Sometimes it may seem that life is just one big stage show. You may act like one person at home, another at school and yet another at church, and you choose which personality and character traits you want people to see. Your life is like a chest of drawers, and each drawer has a costume and mask in that you put on for different occasions. You could rival Alistair McGowan, you have that many different personas! You probably do it without even thinking. But just stop and think now; which mask do you put on when you're with God? Because whatever it is, it's pretty pointless. God doesn't see us as a chest of drawers or a collection of separate performances, He sees us as a whole person. When no one is looking, He sees; when you're at school, He sees; when you're in church, He sees. God made us with one will, one mind, one heart, and one spirit. It's the devil's lie that we can 'have it both ways,' being who we want, when we want; but that just leaves us mentally and emotionally frazzled, and worse; distant from God! God wants us to be the same all the time; no masks, no costumes. How can we do that? By living with integrity, and striving to 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength'. ]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...grace was given me...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 3:8 NIV</span><br>If you were asked to describe yourself in two words, what would you choose? I'm guessing you probably wouldn't get what God would say about you; He says 'pure joy'. Maybe not the first two words that spring to mind! But that is what grace is all about. It means 'pure joy' - although you don't deserve it, God considers it a pure joy to save you. What do you make of that?!? This 'grace' stuff can be a bit hard to get your head around.
In John 8, a woman is caught committing adultery. The law makes no bones about her punishment; the Pharisees are eager to stone her. Jesus, being righteous, surely must agree? Without a lawyer to defend her, or even a character witness, things aren't looking good. But suddenly Jesus starts to write in the sand. We're not told what, but some have suggested maybe a list of their sins, complete with times and places. Ouch! When He's done, her accusers are gone. He says, '...&quot;neither do I condemn you...Go now and leave your life of sin&quot;' (John 8:11 NIV). Jesus lifted her from a position of undeniable guilt to one of unconditional pardon. She didn't deserve it, and didn't know it was possible. And that's your story too, isn't it? We all mess up, and don't deserve God's love; but by His grace, we get it. How awesome is that!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43:2 NIV</span><br>You may be in the middle of your parents' splitting up, and nothing feels worse than being stuck in the middle. It may feel like you're being torn in half. So, can you really 'walk through this fire' without being burned? The Bible says yes, but first you must:
1) Forgive yourself and your parents. Realise it's not your fault. You're not responsible for your parents' relationship, but it's easy to blame yourself. If you do feel responsible, read Isaiah 43:25. God forgives and forgets, and He'll give you the grace to forgive yourself, too. Forgiveness is the one power you always have over anybody who hurts you. So keep on forgiving your parents no matter what; every day. Only by forgiving will you be able to move on. 
2) Take your time and stick with God. Don't expect it to all be sorted instantly. You've been hurt, and it will take time to heal. You may be on an emotional roller coaster, flitting between wanting them back together, and wanting them to suffer. Healthy people make healthy choices, so spend time reading God's Word, praying, asking advice, and letting God love you. '...your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him' (2 Chronicles 30:9 NIV). It won't be easy, but realising God hasn't turned His back on you will help you through this.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;Do you want to be made well?&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 5:6 NKJV</span><br>He hasn't walked for 38 years, the pool didn't have lifeguards to help, and there are no Stannah stair lifts like oldies have to help them up and down the stairs. So when Jesus rocks up and asks this dude '...&quot;Do you want to be made well?&quot;' it may seem like a bit of a 'well duuh' moment! But actually, He asked it to make the guy think. He obviously wanted to be well, but had he thought about what that would mean to his life; would he take responsibility for himself, look after others as well as himself, what job would he get to earn a living?
When we ask God for stuff, we need to be prepared for His answer; it might come with an instruction to change. Sometimes, God's solution is a challenge to us. You're stuck for money? God says 'Ok, here's a paper round!'. He solves the problem, but we have to change too; you can't just sit on your butt and treat God like a free vending machine! 	
The good news is, solving bigger problems brings bigger rewards. So ask God to stretch you today by helping you '...take up your bed and walk' (John 5:8 NKJV). Throw away that dependency and helplessness and move on to bigger and better things. Be prepared to do what God asks, and you'll see a change. Choose life; God's way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...no one pours new wine into old wineskins.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 2:22 NIV</span><br>Imagine it's your lucky day - you've been given £2000 to get yourself a whole new wardrobe. You jump on the bus and hit the shops, grabbing yourself some amazing outfits for every occasion. When you get home, the first thing you do is try everything on again, and do a little fashion show in front of the mirror. After a shopping trip like that, you proudly wear your new clothes everyday, showing the world just how mighty fine you look. 
You wouldn't get home, throw your clothes all over the floor, chuck food on them to cover them in stains, get out the scissors and cut a few holes in them, roll them about in some mud and get the dog to use them as his bed for a week, and only then would you put them on and wear them. If you did, that would be crazy, right?
So if that's the case, why would you even think about doing that with your spiritual clothes? When you become a Christian, it's like God gives you that whole new-life-wardrobe. He gets rid of the old rough edges. So, don't go jumping straight into the old scabby clothes of your life before. Be proud of the changes in you, and show love instead of hate, humility instead of conceit, and worship of God instead of idolatry. Why bother with rags when God's given you riches?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 2:10 NKJV</span><br>When Joshua was almost ready to pop his clogs, he called the nation's big bosses together for a bit of a business meeting. The leaders could remember being supernaturally fed for forty years, seeing the Red Sea sliced in two and the walls of Jericho crumbling. Knowing this, our mate Josh asks them who they're gonna serve. What's the response? 'Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua...' (Joshua 24:31 NKJV). Sounds great so far! But it's not all as rosy as it looks. They served God partly, and only when it suited them. The one thing they had to do after Josh was dead and gone, was to hoover up the last pockets of pagan worship. But Israel '...did not drive out the inhabitants...' (Judges 1:27 NKJV). 
While Joshua had been fully committed to God, the others were only partly committed. So what were the consequences? Their kids messed up big time (Read how in Judges 2:10-19). What shaped the spiritual values of these children? The compromise of their parents! Parents don't always get it right; but unlike these guys here, you can get it right. You don't have to follow the path that everyone else around you is taking; instead, follow God's path, and do things His way. Flip it on its head and be an example to your parents, showing them that if you can live God's way, so can they.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A good and honest life is a blessed memorial; a wicked life leaves a rotten stench.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 10:7 TM</span><br>A cheerful thought for you today; one day, you'll die! When you do, what will people remember you for; fame, or faith? 
Barnabas isn't the most famous guy in the Bible, but he's called '...a good man...full of...faith...' (Acts 11:24 NIV) He wasn't a 'Paul', doing the kinds of things that made him stand out, and he's only mentioned three times in Acts: for selling his land to help finance God's works; vouching for Paul's character; and giving John Mark a second chance. Barnabas didn't earn much fame, but he was known for his faith! The Bible says: 'A good and honest life is blessed'; in God's eyes it's not what society considers important that counts, but faith.
Check out the story of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). For starters, we know Lazarus' name, but we don't have a clue who the rich man was? He may have been famous when he was alive, but where did that get him with God? Precisely nowhere! He had no faith on earth, and now he's only remembered as a nameless 'how not to do it' example! Lazarus may not have had the best life, or been known for anything special when he was alive, but his memory is much more blessed than the rich man's.
So how will you be remembered when you're gone; for fame, or faith? Start living that good and honest faith-filled life today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 4:3  NIV</span><br>'What am I doing this for?' It's a good question to ask yourself often; especially when you're praying! Sometimes we can seem to be doing something good and right but the reason behind what we're doing is all wrong. You might look good making a cup of tea for your dad and buying him his favourite chocolate bar, but if you're doing this because you've just had your mobile phone bill and want him to pay for it; then your reason for being kind is all wrong. The Bible says in 1 Samuel 16:7 'People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart'. You might be able to fool people that you are doing things because you are such a lovely person, but you can't fool God; He looks right through you and sees the reasons behind your actions.
Always check your reason for praying is a good one not a selfish one. Why are you praying for this person or situation? Is it just to make your life easier? God wants our reason for doing things to be because we love Him and because we love people. Being selfish, revengeful or manipulative, will get you nowhere with God. In fact He says if we ask Him for good stuff but our motive is wrong, then forget it. He's not interested, we won't get it! So, why are you doing that?]]></introtext>

You know it would be pointless to walk into a bank and ask them to give you as much money as you wanted whenever you wanted it, don't you? Why? Because these things will never happen will they? If the teacher and the bank manager agreed to your request they wouldn't be doing their job properly would they?
Be careful you don't keep asking God for pointless things! Just like the teacher and the bank manager, God has got a plan of how best to do things. And get this; He knows what's best! So if you come along with a stupid request like, 'make me invisible so I can go and spy on everyone in school', you should know its not going to happen! And that's not because God isn't listening or doesn't care. It's because you are asking Him to go against what He knows is right and He will never do that! Even if your reason for wanting to be invisible is valid; like you want to find out what the school bullies are planning, so you can stop it before it happens; God won't do it! So get real! Tap into God's agenda and know with confidence He is listening and will act!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 66:18 NIV</span><br>Have you seen that programme 'How Clean Is Your House'? If you have you may have found yourself screaming at the TV, 'Uggh!! How can they live like that?' as you look in horror at the amount of dirt and rubbish that's inside. Thankfully by the end of the programme you're feeling relieved, as the house is how it should be; nice and clean! But it only got clean because those brave souls asked for help. They decided that it was better to deal with the humiliation of having their dirty houses shown on TV than for them to live that way any way longer. And even though they are named and shamed in front of thousands watching, by the end of the programme they are looking happy, relieved. Their houses look completely different and their lives have changed for the better. 
When we do things wrong and go against God, it's like we are messing our lives up as much as those people messed up their houses. If we don't ask for help it stays there. Our lives get messier and messier, dirtier and smellier. Carrying this around all day can make us feel, ashamed, guilty, angry, unloved, useless, hopeless, all negative feelings. That's why God says, 'Talk to Me, tell Me all about it; ask for My help, My love, My forgiveness. Just ask and it's yours'. Hide nothing, tell God everything and keep clean!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:16 NIV</span><br>To boldly go where no man has gone before! Recognise the phrase from Star Trek? The space ship, reaching places that had never been seen before! Of course it's just SciFi fantasy; we've not mastered travelling through space in that way just yet! But because of Jesus we are all able to boldly go where no man or woman could go before; directly to God. Before Jesus came to earth not everyone was able to talk directly to God. Animal sacrifices had to be made and certain people were chosen, priests, to go into a place in the centre of the temple and talk to God on behalf of all the people. Often they would tie a long rope around one ankle, so they could be dragged out in case they died in there! Can you imagine having to pray like that? Those guys didn't walk in there with confidence to enjoy Gods' company. They went in scared stiff wondering if they'd be coming out alive! Crazy huh? 
But because God loves us so much, He chose to send His only Son, Jesus, to the earth, to die the ultimate sacrifice, so through believing in Jesus, we can talk with God whenever we want to, we can be forever with God (John 3:16) It's amazingly fantastic! Go confidently, boldly, to God; He's waiting. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He will call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 91:15 NIV</span><br>A child picks up the phone and dials 999 and asks 'is Santa there?' Why? Because he had been annoying his Mum!. Did you know that every day people call 999 when they shouldn't. Calls that say 'I've stubbed my toe' 'There's a dead cat in the road' 'I've lost my keys' 'there's a spider in my bath' 'There's a rat in my kitchen' 'I've ran out of credit!' sound funny at first. But when you see posters about town saying 'Call an ambulance for the wrong reason and someone might die' and you realize the seriousness of the situation.                   
What's so great about God is that He can always cope with the amount of emergency calls He gets. He doesn't even mind if they're trivial or not. He just wants you to call. He wants you to know He's always there to help you. Whatever is bothering you bothers Him. You are so important to Him, you matter so much.
'&quot;If you'll hold on to me for dear life,&quot;' says God, '&quot;I'll get you out of any trouble. I'll give you the best of care if you'll only get to know and trust me. Call me and I'll answer, be at your side in bad times; I'll rescue you, then throw you a party. I'll give you a long life; give you a long drink of salvation!&quot;'(Psalm 91:14 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Fools are headstrong and do what they like; wise people take advice</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 12:15 TM</span><br>There was a girl on Channel 4's Big Brother called Alex, who believed she was always right and everyone around her was wrong. She never seemed to listen properly to what other people were saying, but shouted at people to listen to her. 'Just remember I told you' she said several times during an argument with a fellow housemate one day. But it was as if no-one could tell her anything. Several times Alex was called to the diary room, where it was explained to her that her behaviour was unacceptable, but she continued acting in the same unacceptable way and it wasn't long before she was removed from the BB house. What if Alex had listened to what was being said to her by BB, would it have made a difference to her, do you think? Would she have been removed from the house if not only had she listened but acted upon the advice given to her by BB?
God says 'Fools think their own way is right, but the wise listen to others'. Sometimes we get things wrong. Sometimes its easier for people around us to see where we are going wrong than it is to see it ourselves. What's the word on the streets? Listen to what is being said about you. Listen to what God has to say about it. Is it time for you to change? Be wise; Street wise!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Trust God from the bottom of your heart; don't try to figure out everything on your own</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 3:5 TM</span><br>'I told you so! I knew it! I'm right!' We all enjoy saying words like that don't we? We all want to be right and hate being wrong. But we need to get used to being wrong if we want to live the Christian life. 1 Corinthians 1:25 says: 'For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom...' That means that even the cleverest thing we could ever say sounds so not clever to God. 
A guy in the Bible called Job, had to go through some really rotten stuff in his life and one day he was moaning on to God about it and asked God if He really knew what He was doing? Job thought he was being clever! But God put him in his place saying things like, 'Right Job, did you put the stars in place? No, you didn't! So until you can do stuff like that, don't even think about questioning me, because I obviously know well more than you. Just trust me!'  (for the full version of this chat, read the last few chapters of the book of Job). It shut Job up good and proper. How can you possibly answer that? Well that's just the thing...you can't...no-one can. We were never meant to figure everything out by ourselves, we were meant to ask God and learn from Him. So go on ask...and keep asking. He'll tell you everything you need to know. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NIV</span><br>Seven times in the Gospel of John Jesus describes himself as 'I AM...'.  I AM: bread, light, gate, good shepherd, the resurrection and the life, the way, truth and life, and the true vine. He never said 'I might be', 'I could be' or 'I wanna be'. He said 'I AM'. He was definite, positive, confident, absolutely sure whom He was. Every time He said 'I AM' He told us an amazing truth about himself. Chew over these:
1) '...&quot;I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry again...&quot;' (John 6:35 NIV)  
2) '...&quot;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life&quot;' (John 8:12 NIV)  
3) '&quot;I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved&quot;' (John 10:9 NIV)   
4) '&quot;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.&quot;' (John 10:11 NIV)  
5) '...&quot;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies&quot;' (John 11:25 NIV)   
6) '&quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&quot;' (John 14:6 NIV)   
7) '&quot;I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener&quot;' (John 15:1 NIV) 
Today be confident in the faith you have in Jesus. Be confident in I AM - I AM CONFIDENT!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NIV</span><br>Ever felt disappointed? It's not a nice feeling is it?  It's that feeling you get when things just don't turn out like you'd hoped they would. It stinks! Life feels so unfair doesn't it? Ever felt disappointed in God? 
Sometimes, when we hear what God has done for other people, we can hope that God will do the same for us. We begin to put our faith in God to do these things for us. We may want God to make us into a fantastic worship leader or preacher or help us get that job, or get that girl/guy to go out with us, just like He did for those other people. Or maybe we want God to do amazing miracles through us like we read about in books. 'If God has done it for them' you say, 'then I believe God will do it for me. I have faith!' But sometimes that thing we hoped for doesn't happen and we can get really disappointed. :( [KMP1]
If this has happened to you, ask yourself this, 'Did I hear God promise to do that for me, or did I just tell God I wanted it?' Remember what you read yesterday? The first part of faith is listening. What God promises to one person he may not promise to you. Listen to what God is saying to you and put your faith in that; He won't disappoint you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NIV</span><br>Did you see this years' blockbuster movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? If you're a fan you will have no doubt seen one of the earlier films, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. In this film Indy sets out to find the treasure with the help of his father. Along the path Indy reaches what looks to be a massive canyon, a sheer drop, making it impossible to get to the other side. Indy trusts his father's words, figures out the clues, takes a leap of faith and finds his feet are safely on solid rock. Indy doesn't fall to his death! There was a bridge there all the time, he just couldn't see it. Only when he steps out does he find it. If Indy had only believed in what he could see at that moment he would never have reached the treasure. It took faith. He needed to trust his father's words and walk on the bridge, even though he couldn't see it. Very scary!
We need to have faith in God. Faith is spelt: LBA; Listening to what God says,  Believing it's true and finally Acting on it. Faith is living our lives by what we believe to be true about God; even if it doesn't seem to make sense. Its about believing God is right and trusting him to do what He says, and guess what? He is and He will!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A man's heart plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:9 NKJV</span><br>George dreamed of joining the Navy, but his mother, who was a widow raising her children alone, didn't like the idea. Nevertheless she put on a brave face and agreed to let him go. The day he was due to sail he hugged her good-bye but to everyone's surprise she started to cry. After going through so much heartbreak she just couldn't take any more. George must not board that ship; instead he must stay and be strong for the rest of the family. The boy in the midshipman's uniform wanted a Navy career, but not if it meant adding to his mother's grief. So reluctantly he returned his uniform and ordered his belongings ashore. Of all the young men who might have left home in search of adventure and didn't, he was just one more. Yet his decision had profound influence on the Revolutionary War. A mother's upset stopped her fifteen-year-old from ascending the ranks of the British Navy and embarking on an adventure very different from the one for which he eventually became famous. That's because the boy's name was George Washington, first president of the United States of America.
'We make...plans, but the Lord decides where we will go.' 'The...steps we take come from God; otherwise how would we know where we're going?' (Proverbs 20:24 TM). God knows where he wants you, so don't be afraid if your plans don't quite work out! 
[KMP1]This seems a little one-sided!
[k2]Delete this - it is a fictional tale, not a true story

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...your faith has healed you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 8:48 NIV</span><br>Read Luke 8:43-48. In this story a woman who'd been bleeding for 12 years crept through a crowd to touch the edge of Jesus cloak. After she was instantly healed, Jesus knew something had happened because He 'felt the power go out of Him'. The woman confessed it was her and Jesus blessed her.  
Notice three important things in this story: 
1) She did something she'd never done before. She decided to try Jesus. Smart move! Faith means stepping into the unknown and taking a risk you've never taken before. 
2) She recognised her moment. She knew that Jesus was visiting her town, and might not be back. There are 'God-moments' in life when you've got to get over your fear and move out in faith. If you don't, you'll miss them. 
3) She started a new thing. Until then no one had been healed by touching His cloak but her act of faith was a new day. 'People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed' (Matthew 14:35-36 NIV). God is looking for people who are willing to break with tradition. When He finds them, He uses them to open doors and show new ways of how He can work. So don't be scared to step out and take a risk, it might just start a new thing! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 2:45 NIV</span><br>The Bible says that God wants to bless us. There's an understanding amongst lots of Christians that says God's blessing means if we give £10 we'll get back £100; but it's interesting that nowhere in the whole Bible is this the case! In fact, if you read about the start of the church in Acts you'll see just the opposite. Back then, anyone who had ANYTHING they didn't need, whether it was a building, a camel or a PS2(!) sold it. They then put all the money into a big pot and gave it to the poor. That way no one had too much but everyone had enough, they simply shared what God had given them. How amazing is that? Of course as Christians we all read our Bible and think 'ahh, that's really great. Maybe I should put an extra £10 in the offering this week'. But maybe as followers of Jesus, it's time for an ebay revolution! After all, why is it we pick and choose what bits of the Bible we like and ignore the rest (telling ourselves that bit's not relevant for today)? Maybe as Christians we spend too much time trying to interpret the Bible to make it fit with what we want it to say. After all, Jesus never owned a thing. So why does the stack of DVDs in the corner keep getting higher?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I have been crucified with Christ..</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:20 NIV</span><br>When you became a Christian, did you really look at the label and read the small print? Did you think through what you were buying into? Our churches and youth groups are full of 'Christians', but how many of them can really be called 'followers of Christ'? It's all too easy to miss-sell Christianity as a free ticket to heaven and cushy life with ready-made mates. But this is not what it means to be a true follower of Jesus. 
Paul writes: 'I am crucified with Christ.' To our selfish lives those words are about as appealing as having a tooth out; yet that's exactly what we're supposed to be as Christians! In theory we should have laid down our own lives, given up our plans, our relationships, our gifts, our possessions; put them before Jesus and said 'You have them, I'll do whatever You want me to do'. But how many of us have really done this? We can all probably remember the odd moment in an incredible time of worship and intimacy with Jesus when we gently whispered 'You can have it all'. But the sad truth is most of us walk out of that place and within 24 hours we've picked everything back up again for ourselves and carried on as normal. Think today, do I want to be a Christian; or a follower of Jesus?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4:10 NIV</span><br>When someone tells you to be more 'responsible', it's usually the last thing you'd ever want to do. After all, isn't that for people who are old and boring, and people who never have any fun? In fact the opposite is true; as you grow up the more responsible you are the more freedom you're going to have to have fun, because things are far less likely to go 'Pete Tong'! It's not about being old or boring or mature, it's about realising you're responsible for your own life and making good choices instead of doing something stupid and regretting it for the rest of your life. Here are three ways in which we can be more responsible. 
1) Following through. If you're a quitter; someone who never finishes what they start, try giving yourself smaller things to finish. Do stuff that really matters to you, and when you start to finish those, think about tackling some other areas. 
2) Taking care of the small stuff.  How often do you forget small things; that are big things to others? Like forgetting anniversaries and birthdays, not taking the bins out or not calling someone back. Start sorting out the small things first, they matter to other people!  
3) Do it yourself. Too many people expect others to do things for them, especially if you're used to your parents doing things. So start doing things by yourself! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 9:12 NIV</span><br>We all love the idea of a better world, city or school. Maybe you've even been praying for God to DO SOMETHING, what if he has done something - sent you! 
In a graduation speech he was giving to a whole load of uni students, Chief Judge Alexander Saunders said, 'As responsibility is passed to your hands it will not do to assume that someone else will bear the major burdens, that someone else will demonstrate the key convictions, that someone else will be elected Member of Parliament, take care of the poor, visit the sick, protect civil rights, enforce the law, transmit value, and defend freedom. What you do not value will not be valued, what you do not remember will not be remembered, what you do not change will not be changed, what you do not do will not be done. You can, if you will, craft a society whose leaders...are less obsessed with the need for money. It's not a question of what to do, but simply the will to do it.' 
Paul writes: '...each one should carry his own load' (Galatians 6:5 NIV). Don't leave it to someone else! You've got a job to do! Sometimes we don't take responsibility because we believe others are more qualified. No, people who make a difference in life, only do so because they decided to try. Plus: God doesn't call the qualified, He qualifies the called!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He went a little farther...and prayed...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 14:35 NKJV</span><br>Throughout history God has looked for men and women to passionately pray on behalf of a lost world. More often than not, He's been disappointed. '...I sought for a man...who would...stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one' (Ezekiel 22:30 NKJV). 
The disciples were willing to go with Jesus into the garden of Gethsemane but they didn't get how important it was to pray that night and all fell asleep. Even Peter, James and John, the guys in the inner circle, didn't 'get it,' so in the end Jesus went 'a little farther' and prayed alone. Prayer can be a lonely business and you have to stick at it. You can go for months and years before seeing some of the changes that you've prayed so hard about. On the other hand, when you go deeper with God, you get to share things that the disciples missed and only angels got to see to that night in the garden.
Why not get your youth group to set up a 24/7 prayer room for a week, or turn your bedroom into your own garden of Gethsemane and give up some sleep to go deeper with God? You could even join the grannies at your church for the early morning prayer meeting! How about it, is God calling you to go 'a little farther?']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...the rod of Aaron...sprouted and...produced blossoms...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 17:8 NKJV</span><br>New leadership was urgently needed in Israel. So God ordered an elder from each of the twelve tribes to bring a wooden staff with his name on it, and leave it overnight in the tabernacle - the big tent that they used as a portable temple. He said, 'the staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout...' (Numbers 17:5 NIV). Next morning Aaron's rod 'sprouted and...produced blossoms.' Notice: 
1) Whose staff grew blossom; Aaron's! Obviously God doesn't pick His leaders because they're perfect. Aaron's CV included making a golden calf for Israel to worship, then defending himself by saying, 'That cow just walked out of the fire all by itself.' Would you pick somebody like that? God did. That's because He sees in us potential qualities He can use to fulfil His purposes. Keep that in mind, next time a leader disappoints you. And remember it, should God call you to lead. 
2) Where it blossomed; in the presence of the Lord. Certain things only happen in God's presence. In Aaron's case a walking stick came to life in '...the tabernacle of meeting...where I meet with you' (Numbers 17:4 NKJV). So, sort out your priorities, set time to meet with God each day, and keep it. 
3) When it blossomed; during the darkness. Remember your faith grows when you are going through hard and dark times rather than when everything is cool.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...perfect love casts out fear...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 4:18 NKJV</span><br>What are you afraid of? 'There is no room in love for fear. Well-formed love banishes fear. Since fear is crippling, a fearful life-fear of death, fear of judgment-is one not yet fully formed in love.' (1 John 4:18 TM). Today, ask God to give you a fresh understanding of how much He loves you, for who He loves He prizes, protects, and provides for. 
Paul writes: '...[I pray]...that...you'll be able to take in...the extravagant dimensions of Christ's love...' (Ephesians 3:18 TM). Extravagant love! God's Love is MASSIVE, He couldn't love you any more than He does right now! You say, 'What does God's love look like?' Look at the cross. If you had been the only person who ever lived, Jesus would have died just for you. Even if you're thinking 'yeah but you don't know how I've messed up' He never stops loving you! You didn't do anything to deserve it, so when you fail you don't lose it. The Bible says: '...absolutely nothing can get between us and God's love...' (Romans 8:39 TM).
Don't even be afraid of your weaknesses. As you get your head round it and you're more secure in God's love you can begin to acknowledge your weaknesses, seek His help, grow strong, and use the gifts He's given you. When you know God loves you, not despite but because of who you are, you have the ultimate self-esteem; and it comes from God's esteem for you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Let us go into the house of the Lord.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 122:1 NIV</span><br>What's your reason for not going to church? Before you answer, read Ten Reasons Why I Never Wash! 
1) I was forced to wash as a child 2) people who wash are all hypocrites; they think they are cleaner than everyone else 3) there are so many different kinds of soap; I just can't decide which one is best for me 4) I used to wash, but I got bored and stopped doing it 5) I only wash on special occasions like Christmas and Easter 6) none of my friends wash 7) I'll start washing when I get older and dirtier 8) I don't have time to wash 9) the bathroom is never warm enough in winter or cool enough in summer 10) the people who make soap are only after your money! Sound familiar?
Watchman Nee, who went to prison for going to church in China says, 'Alone I cannot serve the Lord effectively, and he will spare no pains to teach me this. He will bring things to an end, allowing doors to close and leaving me effectively knocking my head against a wall until I realise that I need the help of the body, as well as of the Lord.' We need church; you'll find a spiritual family to belong to, a faith to live by, and a focus that gets your eyes where they should be; on Jesus! ]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I will...heal your wounds...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 30:17 NIV</span><br>Addressing students at Virginia Tech after a shooting rampage that left 32 of their fellow students dead, Philip Yancey said: 'You've heard, &quot;Things will get better, you'll get past this.&quot; Those who offer such comfort mean well, and what you feel now you won't always feel...Yet you're a different person because of that day. When three of my friends died I came across these lines: &quot;Grief melts away like snow in May,&quot;... It did melt away, but like snow it came back in fierce, unexpected ways, triggered by a sound, a smell, a fragment of memory.'
Yancey, who was recovering at the time from a car crash continued, 'Pain is a sign of life and love. I'm wearing a neck brace because I broke my neck in an accident. The doctor kept asking, &quot;Does this hurt? Can you feel that?&quot; The answer he desperately wanted was, &quot;Yes, it hurts, I can feel it&quot;; proof that my spinal cord hadn't been severed. Pain offers proof of life, of connection. In deep wounds two kinds of tissue must heal: connective tissue, plus the outer protective tissue. If the outer protective tissue heals too quickly the inner connective tissue won't heal properly, leading to complications later.' 
Real healing takes time; it takes place where God's presence, God's peace, and God's people are. Are you hurting today? Turn to God. His promise to you is 'I will...heal your wounds.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You...are a letter from Christ.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:3 NIV</span><br>'...if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV). The message in our letter should make it clear that we're not the people we used to be, because: 
1) Christ has changed us mentally. Being '...transformed by the renewing of [our] mind' (Romans 12:2 NIV) we now look at life, ourselves, others, our challenges and options in light of God's thoughts, not ours. We see opportunities where we saw only obstacles, and possibilities where we saw only problems. Minds that were frazzled with worry, are now filled with confidence and peace. 
2) Christ has changed us morally. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 describes how NOT to live-It describes 'those who use and abuse each other, use and abuse sex, use and abuse the earth and everything in it' and then we're hit with verse 11: 'for not so long ago you were on that list. Since then, you've been cleaned up and given a fresh start by Jesus' (TM). He has transformed our character. 
3) Christ has changed us spiritually. That's why only someone who has God's Spirit can understand spiritual blessings. Anyone who doesn't have God's Spirit thinks these blessings are foolish (1 Corinthians 2:14)! Your letter should read: 'Jesus changed my life, and if you let Him, He will change yours too!' So, today, deliver your love letter to everyone you meet.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You...are a letter from Christ.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:3 NIV</span><br>The Bible says your life is a love letter from Jesus, 'known and read by everybody.' But a letter is only effective, if it is easily read and understood.  Adults moan because they can't understand text language, 'what's  &quot;C U L8R M8&quot; mean?' They don't get it; which isn't a problem when you txt your mate but might cause difficulties when you txt your mum! People must understand your message. 
How can you make sure your love letter from Jesus gets through to the people He's sending it to?  Here are things that some common things can confuse your message: a) a begrudging, resentful attitude when a friend, teacher, or parent asks you to go the extra mile and help at an inconvenient time b) not giving your best to the things you've committed to c) being unreliable, not keeping promises d) touchiness, like when you wear your feelings on your sleeve, are easily upset and overreact to unintended offences e) temper tantrums or sulking, where you're moody and grumpy because things don't go your way f) compromising, where you go with the flow and don't take a stand or have the guts to stand out. 
Instead of Jesus they see moody or unreliable or compromising Christians. How we live says something; we can give people the wrong message. Jesus has a letter of love. Make sure people can get it. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You...are a letter from Christ...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:3 NIV</span><br>'This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son...by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life' (John 3:16) God sent Jesus to demonstrate His love and He sends us to tell people 'You...are a letter from Christ...written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God.' 
When a letter arrives two questions immediately spring up in our mind: 
1) Who is it for? John's answer is 'ANYONE'! For every person you meet, you will have something they need. Friends, enemies, relatives, neighbours and strangers need the message you have and the hope you bring. 
2) Who is it from? A letter from someone you fancy is more interesting than some junk mail! Remember, you are a letter from Christ, about Christ. 'For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord...' (2 Corinthians 4:5 NIV). Our message is not about us; it's about Jesus. 'But are people really interested in Jesus?' you ask. In His lifetime Jesus was a national celebrity who could draw big crowds. Statistics say 1 billion people across the world are Christians today. Jesus isn't junk mail. 'But I, when I am lifted up...will draw all men to myself' (John 12:32 NIV). Today nothing is more needed than a living portrait of Jesus Christ, so deliver your love letter to 'anyone' who crosses your path!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:26 NIV</span><br>When you go to a foreign country you can feel uncomfortable and a bit lost, because you don't speak the language. The language of the spiritual world is prayer and since the spiritual world is the source of our power; victory, peace, joy, and everything else we need; it's essential that we learn to speak it. The good news is, we have the perfect teacher and interpreter; the Holy Spirit Himself. One of His jobs is to teach us the language of prayer and guide us when it comes to addressing God and He's good at this job! The Bible says the Holy Spirit can interpret our prayers to God even when we don't know what to say. 'If we don't know how or what to pray, it doesn't matter. He does our praying in and for us, making prayer out of our wordless sighs, our aching groans' (Romans 8:26 TM). Isn't that cool? 
Prayer is the link between the physical and the spiritual world; remember Jesus listened to His Dad. He looked into heaven and copied it on earth.  The Spirit also shows us what God is saying. That's why prayer cannot be rushed. It's also why taking time to be still before God is so important. It allows the Holy Spirit to share God's thoughts with us, so that we begin thinking His way and be like Him on earth?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...we are the clay, and You our potter...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 64:8 NKJV</span><br>Imagine a beautiful china teacup saying: 'I wasn't always like this. There was a time when I was just a cold, hard lump of clay. One day the potter picked me up and said, &quot;I could do something with this.&quot; Then he started to put pressure on me and change my shape. I said, &quot;What are you doing? That hurts. Stop!&quot; But he said, &quot;Not yet.&quot; Then he put me on a wheel and began to spin me around and around until I shouted, &quot;Let me off.&quot; He replied, &quot;Not yet.&quot; Then he shaped me into a cup and put me in a hot oven. I cried, &quot;Let me out of here, I'm suffocating.&quot; But he looked at me and said, &quot;Not yet.&quot; When he took me out, I thought his work on me was over, but then he started to paint me, then I was back in the oven, it was so hot! Then I he put me on shelf till I thought he'd forgotten me. Eventually I saw what had happened;  I had become a beautiful teacup'
There are things going on in your life today that you don't understand. When you finally get to the place God wants you to be, you'll realise that He has been making you into a vessel He can use, bless, and use to bless others. So, allow God to shape you!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;CARRY EACH OTHER'S BURDENS...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:2 NIV</span><br>The Bible says we're a body with different parts doing different jobs. Instead of gazing at our own belly-buttons we should be looking at how we can help each other, just like the soldier in this story...
'I noticed a guy out of sync. A big, raw-boned redhead named Sanderson. His legs were pumping but he was out of step with the rest of us. His head began to loll from side to side. He was close to losing it. Without missing a step the ranger on Sanderson's right reached over and took his rifle. Now one of the rangers was packing two weapons. The big redhead did better for a time. But then, while the platoon kept moving, his jaw became slack, his eyes glazed and his legs pushed like pistons. Soon his head began to sway again. This time the ranger on the left reached over, removed Sanderson's helmet, tucked it under his own arm and continued to run. Our boots thudded along the dirt trail in heavy unison. Thud, thud, thud! But Sanderson was hurting ; really hurting. He was buckling, going down. But no, two soldiers behind him lifted the pack off his back, each taking a shoulder strap in his free hand. Sanderson gathered his remaining strength, squared his shoulders and the platoon continued to run; all the way to the finish line.' Whose load can you help to carry today?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 2:23 NIV	</span><br>Old Abe; He lived about 4000 years ago and was pretty comfy with his well-to-do family in a big buzzing city. One day he heard God calling him to pack his tent and sleeping bag and head off somewhere new. Cool! Except God didn't say where! But Abraham wasn't thick, he knew that searching for God's 'somewhere' was better than settling for the world's 'anywhere'. Abraham is an example of faith at its finest. The Bible calls believing what God says 'FAITH' and says Abraham's faith was so great that ;it was credited to him'. Just like you need credit to make your mobile phone work, God accepted Abraham's faith as credit to make his life work. 
Are you feeling today as if your life is low on credit? Have you started accepting the world's 'anywhere' rather than God's 'somewhere'? Choose to believe God and take the example of Abe; his faith had to stand many tests: a) when he left his family and country, he didn't have a clue where God was taking him b) he wasn't a real hard nut but he fought the enemy to save his family c) he believed for a son, even when he and his wife were well too old for all that making babies stuff! 
So keep believing God and don't run out of credit.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He provided redemption for his people...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 111:9 NIV</span><br>You've seen it in the movies; the kidnappers trap the billionaire's son, and send a ransom note: 'give us 10 million or never see your son again'.  The word redeemed, which gets used in church in songs and stuff means this: TO BUY BACK. If the billionaire paid up, he has redeemed his child. He has paid the price to get back what was his in the first place. In the movies the hero normally crashes through a window and rescues the kid, but the in the Bible the hero is also the redeemer. The hero pays the price to get us back to God.
Have you ever thought of yourself as somebody who needs to be redeemed or bought back? The Bible says our selfishness and sin caused us to fall into '...the trap of the devil...held captive to do his will' (2 Timothy 2:26 NIV). Getting back to God, your rightful owner, could only come through redemption and that's exactly what God did! 'For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life' (John 3:16 NIV). Christ's death on the cross was the price of your redemption, your ransom; that's how much God values you! A Christian simply is someone knows they needed rescuing. If you've never asked God to rescue you, you can do it today; what's stopping you?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Think on these things.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:8 KJV</span><br>Your ability to succeed in life often comes down to a single choice: how you react to what has been done to you in the past, or is being done to you right now. Dr Viktor Frankl endured the Holocaust by this principle. The Nazis killed his family, placed him in a concentration camp, starved and beat him. When the war ended Frankl was neither broken nor bitter. When asked how he endured such treatment with a positive outlook he said, 'Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms, to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.'
Listen to the attitude God's Word calls us to adopt: 'I'd say you'll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, gracious; the best, not the worst; the beautiful, not the ugly; things to praise, not things to curse' (Philippians 4:8)
Every day you choose the clothes you wear, the food you eat, and the attitude you adopt. And there are only two kinds of attitudes; good ones and bad ones. A good attitude is the one the Psalmist adopted when he woke up each morning: 'This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it' (Psalms 118:24 NKJV). Make that your attitude too!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Jesus...made Himself nothing...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:5-7 NIV</span><br>The story is told of an ambitious student at a top notch uni. Just before entering his final year he met an old hippy who said, 'Your idea of happiness is to work around the clock, to study so you can get a better grade than the next guy. That's not how you're supposed to live. Come discover peace, man.' Before you know it the student had called his parents and told them he was dropping out of uni to live in a hippy commune. Six months later they received a letter: 'Dear Mum and Dad, I know you were upset about my decision. But I've changed! I have peace. Here there's no competing, no trying to get ahead of anyone. This way of life is so in harmony with my inner self, that in only six months I've become the number two disciple in the entire commune. And I think I can be number one by June.' Hello! Listen, competition hardly ever leads to serving but often leads to striving! 
The disciples had started arguing about who would be the greatest in His kingdom. Jesus listened, then He picked up a towel and a basin of water and began to wash their feet. When He finished they were speechless, their hearts exposed, their attitudes corrected. 'Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus (who) made himself nothing.' Bottom line: serve, don't strive!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...the blood...cleanses us from all sin.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 1:7 NKJV</span><br>John writes: 'But if we live in the light, as God does, we share in life with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus washes all our sins away.'  He gives us three ways to shine! 
1) By living in the light.  Live life bright!  If you are hiding stuff or hoping your Mum doesn't find out, then you are living in the shadows not the light! 
2) By sharing life with each other. Other people can inspire you to reach higher, tell you when you're out of line and help you when stuff is tough. Make sure you have people who are a bit older and a bit wiser who you are 100% honest with and will be 100% honest with you even when you don't what to hear it!
3) By dealing with your sin right away the moment you know you've messed up then make sure you 'fess up.  Jesus died to deal with that sin, sort it with God and hold on to the forgiveness He gives you,. Get it sorted then get up and go on with God; don't wallow in self-condemnation.
God has put everything in you to blaze brightly in like a star. He's given you friends, family and leaders to draw out the best in you and the blood of Jesus to cleanse your heart. So what's stopping you! LIVE IN THE LIGHT!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I judge only as I hear....</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 5:30 NIV</span><br>Ever wonder why Jesus was always on form and knew what to do?  He tells us: Jesus gave them this answer: 'I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does.' (John 5:19-20 NIV) and 'By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.' (John 5:30 NIV).
Here's the secret, Jesus didn't just talk to His Dad, He took time to listen and get instructions. Your parents might say that you never listen to them and they are chatting away right in your ear; so how do you do when it comes to listening to your heavenly Dad?  It's not easy, but when the Bible says, 'Pray without ceasing' (1 Thessalonians 5:17), it means we are to stay in touch with God at all times, to be spiritually sensitive and attuned to the still small voice of His Spirit within us. That calls for having an uncluttered mind and heart. 
It's easy to tell God what we want but what does He want? God designed the plan for your life; so today, why not get quiet before Him, so that He can tell you about it?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>For though a righteous man falls...he rises again...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 24:16 NIV</span><br>An unfit but determined 40-year-old schoolteacher decided to become a jogger and eventually entered a Marathon; a full 26 miler! It's a gruelling test of heart, mind and body. She knew she wasn't going get an amazing time she just wanted to finish the race; to say she did it! And it wasn't easy! As she ran huge blisters developed on her feet. She was hit and injured by a bicycle. Several miles short of the finish line she was utterly exhausted, yet she kept going. Then within a few hundred yards of her goal, late at night when most other runners had finished or dropped out, she fell and lay flat on her face too tired to get up. But her friends put a bit of tape across the finish line and began to cheer her on. She lifted her head, saw the tape and realised her goal was within sight. With supreme effort she got back up, and with a burst of energy dredged up from deep within her, ran the last few yards.'
The Bible talks about what we should focus on when times get tough. Victory belongs to those who keep looking at the goal, not the going; not the process, but the prize; not the trial, but the treasure that's promised to those who persevere. In other words; don't give up and if you fall, take God's hand and get up!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...a prudent man gives thought to his steps.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 14:15 NIV</span><br>If you're still making the same mistakes you were last year, you need to ask God for wisdom. 'Wise men and women are always learning, always listening for fresh insights' (Proverbs 18:15 TM). Think about it- you are where you are today because of decisions you've made in the past. Both good and bad. If you want to change your future, learn to make better decisions:  a) never make permanent decisions based on temporary circumstances. If you do, you'll regret it b) don't let your emotions take over. Pray, weigh things carefully looking at all the fact not just feelings c) surround yourself with People who will tell you the truth; even when you don't want to hear it d) take the time to consider all options. What looks good to you today, may not look so good tomorrow  e) consider the consequences of each action. Ask yourself, 'Am I ready to handle this right now?' f) be realistic. If you can't count, don't apply for a job in the finance office. If you can't sing, don't record an album. Focus on what God gifted you to do. That's where you'll succeed g) time is your most limited and valuable resource. Don't waste it h) allow yourself a 10% risk of being wrong, a 50% likelihood of betrayal, and a 100% commitment to trust God, go forward and survive it all.]]></introtext>

The Bible says: 'God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it' (Genesis 2:15 NIV). Today God may be saying to you, 'I've prepared you, placed you where you need to be, planted blessings in your life that are scheduled to come up at different times, but now you've got to work it.'	
God may have placed you in a church or group of people; that doesn't mean they won't wind you up. God might have planted opportunities in your life; that doesn't mean making the most of them isn't hard work. No one likes being formed and prepared, especially if that means we have to change!  It takes time, but it's worth it. In our comfort obsessed culture we can forget that what is easiest isn't always best. Don't expect God to do things He's expecting you to do- Get to work! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God planted a garden...there He put the man whom He had formed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV</span><br>Do your parents ever watch 'Location Location Location' on Channel 4? In the programme, a woman with frilly blouses and a really tall bloke help people find their perfect home in the perfect location! Notice in the verse, God placed the man in the garden, 'eastward in Eden' (Genesis 2:8 NKJV). It's not enough to be in the garden, you've got to be in the right location.  That doesn't have to mean the school you go to or the house you live in (those things might be out of your control) but it might mean what group of mates you hang out with, or if you join the worship team at church, or if sign up for that mission week. God has a plan so ask Him to place you in the locations, relationships and opportunities that are perfect for you. Remember, God doesn't want to dump you, drop you or shove you somewhere, He wants to place you.  Ever played chess with someone who spends ages thinking about his or her next move? They pick up the queen slowly place it on a square, keep their finger on for a moment and then finally sit back. It was thought through- it was placed!  God knows what He is doing! It's easy to drift into your future but instead go to God, who will place you. If He places you somewhere you know it's in the plan.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...God planted a garden...there He put the man whom He had formed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV</span><br>Before God put Adam into the garden, He 'formed' him.  God knows where he wants you (remember yesterday?) and how he wants to use you. Maybe He's told you about it, but now you're frustrated because it's not happening yet. There's a process of preparation God takes us through, but preparation takes time. God must deal with our inconsistencies, personality defects, areas of distrust, and a sackful of other stuff. How long does it take? Only God knows.  The Bible says the Lord 'formed man out of the dust of the ground' (Genesis 2:7 NKJV). What is God working with? Dirt! And the tools He uses to form you are the experiences you go through in life. They shape and alter you. And the more you keep trying to have it your way, the longer the process takes. It may take you five years to learn to stop people-pleasing, or ten years to stop feeling sorry for yourself, or twenty years to stop going back and reliving your childhood. All the while God is telling you, 'Stop it,' and you're saying, 'Yeah, I know. I'm gonna do better.' Then finally a crisis happens and the truth hits you. You need to change. At that point you say, 'You know what? I'm going to forget those things which are behind and start reaching for those things which are before' (Philippians 3:13). Why wait?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE IMPORTANT THING IS...THEY ARE PREACHING ABOUT CHRIST. SO I AM HAPPY..</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 1:18</span><br>Imagine you have a Great Uncle George who owns a corner shop and invites you round. Behind the counter there's row upon row of sweets. As you stand eyes bulging and mouth drooling Great Uncle George says, 'Take what you want!' WHAT? WOW!! All this stuff... for FREE! You fill your pockets with all you can carry! 
God tells us that He has loads of good things stored in Heaven for us to have FOR FREE! (Deuteronomy 28:12) So nothing matters because, no matter what is going on, God will take care of us and provide for all our needs. Even when our problem is other people! Paul wrote today's Bible verse when he was stuck in prison and some other Christians were causing him hassle, making it worse for him instead of better. Paul knew about all the stuff God has stored in Heaven. He knew it wasn't worth worrying or arguing over. God would sort it! That's why he was able to say...'it doesn't matter'.  All God asks is that we do the best we can for Him in whatever situation we're in and rely on Him to take care of the rest! Even taking care of other people. So if you're feeling hassled, annoyed, anxious because of feelings towards other people, go and ask God to fill you full of stuff from His Heavenly warehouse, and then say it doesn't matter!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU THINK BECAUSE YOUR THOUGHTS RUN YOUR LIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 4:23 </span><br>Ever thought negative things about your ability, your appearance, your personality, what you have or don't have or about your life as a whole? Ever thought similar negative things about other people? Keep thinking like this and your going to have a pretty negative life, says God!
But how can you be careful about what you think though? Thoughts just pop into your head, right? You can't control what you think? Or how often you think it? Perhaps not?! But you can control what you do with them. You can stop them in mid flow:  
1) Do the Maths: Each thought you have, ask yourself, 'Does God agree with it?' If He doesn't, think about what God would think instead! Positive thought + agreement with God = keep it. Negative thought + disagreement with God = chuck it. 
2) Choose the subject: Keep doing maths and you'll soon learn God's thoughts about a whole loada stuff. You'll be able to recognise a bad thought instantly and can choose to switch the subject before it takes root. Get those bad thoughts in a choke-hold until they give up and submit to Jesus (2 Corinthians 10:5). 
3) Don't feel your way: Don't rely on what you feel, go with what you know. We live by what we believe, not by what we can see. (2 Cororinthians 5:7) So, no playing mind games, be careful what you think.]]></introtext>

LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD TODAY! </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 118:24 (NCV)</span><br>Ever watched a kid being made to say sorry when they didn't want to? They say the word....but you so know they don't mean it. Or ever been asked to say 'Thank you' to your Aunty Betty for giving you THAT JUMPER for Christmas? It's so false isn't it? You don't mean it so why say it? Well God doesn't want that sort of relationship with you; where you tell Him stuff but don't mean it. 
Get this: you're alive because God created you to be here at this moment in time. Everything you're going through, He knows about it; more than that, He's bothered, He's going through it with you and He's never going to leave you, never going to give up on you. He loves you more than you can imagine, He's got your name tattooed on the palm of His hand, never a moment goes by where He's not thinking of you. He loves the sound of your voice, your quirky ways, the way you look, even when you've just got out of bed He thinks you look great! Every time you mess up He'll forgive you, all you have to do is ask. When you hurt, he hurts. He's so into you! All that, and more, is happening EVERY single day! Now isn't that worth being thankful for. Today IS a day to Enjoy.......and by the way, so is tomorrow...and the next day...and the day after that... ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 1:37 NIV</span><br>Ever watched a moth fly around a light? There's the whole room to fly around in, yet they keep as close as possible to the light! Their focus never moves off the light. They stick to their agenda!
God wants you to be that focused on Him! All sorts of stuff will fly by your life, trying to distract you from Jesus. People will throw their opinions at you, trying to get you doing what they think you should be doing. Spend time with God, get to know what you should be doing from Him, and don't do anything different.
In Mark 1: 33-34 you can read how, 'The whole town gathered...and Jesus healed many'. As you can imagine, the next morning another crowd of needy people were waiting on His doorstep, but how Jesus responded this time might surprise you. 'While it was still dark, Jesus...left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed...his companions went to look for him, and when they found him they exclaimed: &quot;Everyone is looking for you!&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;Let us go somewhere else...so I can preach there also. That is why I have come&quot;' (vs 35-38). What was He thinking? There were headlines to be made, fans waiting to pat Him on the back! How good would that have been? Not as good as focusing on God's plans. He wants you to do the same.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE MAN WHO DOES NOT GIVE UP WHEN TESTS COME IS HAPPY</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:12 (NLT)</span><br>Even the thought of them can make you feel sick and dizzy, so not many people look forward to that time of year when EXAMS come around. Aaagghh! Ever wish you didn't get stressed? Wouldn't it be great if no matter what was going on you could just handle it; no stress; no pressure; feeling good 100%? Well if Paul learnt how to do just that, so can you! 
How did he learn it? He sat every single exam that was given to him. In every test of life he clung hold of Jesus and said; 'show me how to get through this God'. He had his fair share of tests to put up with: he was beaten to a pulp, shipwrecked, ridiculed, imprisoned in the type of places that would be illegal today, and even stoned (and we're not talking drugs here, we're talking being pelted with bricks)! He could have thrown in the towel anytime, given up on God, but instead he said, 'I can make it through anything because Jesus gives me strength (Philippians 4:13). Through sticking with Jesus he 'learned to be content whatever the circumstances' (Philippians 4:11)   
Heaven is cheering you on today so don't give in! When you get knocked down get up again! Be more determined than ever to live for Jesus! And you like Paul will find that stress can be overcome by God's power.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD HAS HANDED YOUR ENEMY OVER TO YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 26:8 (NCV)</span><br>Ever wanted to 'punch someone's lights out'? Abishai was a bit like that. He was a friend of David, who had a best mate called Jonathan, whose dad was called Saul, who was really jealous of David and wanted to stick a spear through his head (no really!) The whole situation made an episode of Eastenders look like the Teletubbies (check it out in 1 Samuel 18)! A few episodes later (1 Samuel 26) we find David, who'd run for his life, in a situation where if he wanted to, he could stick a spear through Saul's head instead! Revenge! His mate Abishai was well up for it (1 Samuel 26:8), and actually believed that it was what God wanted. But David knew God better. More than wanting to punch Saul's lights out, for treating him so badly, he wanted Saul to know God, so he chose to act God's way. He was more interested in making God known, than making himself known. More willing to trust God to sort out Saul, than do it himself. David was no wimp, he could have taken Saul out,   but He chose to do things God's way.
Where's your head at? Do you get your fists out or stab at people with pointed words? DON'T DO IT! God says, 'don't insist on getting even, that's not for you...I'll take care of it' (Romans 8:19). ]]></introtext>

Or your ipod to work with no battery? And however much you want your mobile phone never to run out of credit, you know that there will come a time when you're going to have to top up! If you don't; the thing's useless, even if you've got the latest all singing all dancing model.
Well don't expect to live the Christian life without powering up either! You may look great, but nothing much will happen. Ephesians 5:18 tells us to 'be filled with the Spirit.' God's Holy Spirit is like our spiritual power supply. You need to be filled with Holy Spirit; God's Power, because only then are you going to be able to experience the effects of God in your life. Check out the New Testament for examples of what happens when people are filled with Holy Spirit. AMAZING!
When your mobile is topped up and charged up it can do what it was designed to do. When you get topped up and charged up with God Power, you're able to do what you were designed to do, too. What are you waiting for? Get praying for God to fill you with His Holy Spirit, so you can see the effects of God's power flowing in and out of your life. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH; GLOOM AND DOOM LEAVE YOU BONE-TIRED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 17:22 (TM)</span><br>Ok, you may not want to hear about the film Mary Poppins, but stick with it! One of the scenes involves a visit to Uncle Albert, who floats in the air uncontrollably whenever he laughs. Its infectious and soon everyone ends up floating around singing 'I love to laugh' and having tea on the ceiling. It gives a great picture of what God is saying to us today. Be happy inside, it makes a difference; it gives you a boost that can keep you healthy. 
Isn't it the best when you have a day where you feel on top of the world, you're confident, you're thinking positive, you even find it easy to be nice to people!? Well God wants you to have more of these days; they're good for you!
But it is easier said than done though isn't it? Life is tough sometimes. So is God asking the impossible? Is there a holy happy pill? Well check out Nehemiah 8:10 'Don't feel bad. The joy of God is your strength!' God never asks you to do something without helping you achieve it. The more you get to know God, the more you learn to trust Him and the easier it becomes to be happy inside, no matter what is happening. So what you waiting for? Get into God; knowing Him is better than any sort of happy pill!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE. DO NOT THINK ABOUT THE THINGS OF THE PAST. SEE, I WILL DO A NEW THING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43: 19-18 (NLT)</span><br>Heard of David Beckham? Of course you have. Yet there was a time nobody knew him. He started out as most kids, loving football, dreaming of playing for his country. He played whenever he could and kept on practising. The mistakes he made, didn't stop him from keeping on trying, neither did getting beat! He concentrated on his future, not what he couldn't do or had done wrong. He made his first Premier League appearance for Man United on 2 April 1995, in a 0-0 draw against Leeds United. It could have been all over for Beckham then, except he had a pretty cool manager, Alex Ferguson, who choose to do something new. Instead of buying star players when experienced players left, he let the youth players replace them. He was criticised for it...especially when the season started with a 3-1 defeat! But Alex saw the potential in these young guys, he saw their hard work, dedication and determination. He did something new, so they could have a chance to fulfil their dreams. For Beckham... the rest, as we say, is History. 
Imagine if had a manager like that, who'd take a risk on you so you could fulfil your dreams! Well guess what? U DO!!! God is the best manager you could ever have. He sees your potential and wants to unlock it! So get out there; God wants you on his team!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUT FORGET ALL THAT, IT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO. FOR I AM ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING NEW.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43 :18-19  (NLT)</span><br>Has someone stopped you doing something because you messed up the last time? Ever felt like you missed out on something because you weren't trusted? Have you stopped chasing after your dream because you've told yourself you're not good enough, or talented enough? We all make mistakes and it's easy to turn these mistakes into doubting our own ability, especially when other people doubt our ability too. Gods not like that. When He looks at us, all He sees is what we can be; not all that we have been. He wants us to see the same. God doesn't want you to live thinking about all the stuff that's gone wrong.
Have you ever walked into something because you weren't looking where you were going? You feel stupid don't you... and get hurt! It's not the best or safest way to walk is it?  That's why God asks us to live our lives looking where we're going, looking at what He is doing. Check out the future God planned for these guys, who chose to look ahead to what God could do with their life: Rahab, a prostitute saves her family from death, (Joshua 6:25); Joseph,a shepherd boy, saves thousands from starvation (Genesis 41:54); Deborah wins a war and brings peace in Israel for 40 years (Judges 5:31). Look forwards not backwards and see what God will do with your life.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE ARE PRESSED...BUT NOT...BROKEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 4:8 TLB</span><br>Do you ever feel like your head's mashed? You've got yourself in a situation that's stickier than a jam butty? You're stuck in a room with a hundred doors but none of them will open? Don't stress about it; God's got it sorted. You're mates with the Man of miracles. You may feel like everyone's out to get you, but God's never going to abandon you. It's when you're under pressure that your faith really shines through; and God knows just how much pressure you can deal with. He lets us get to the stage when a) we've tried all our own ways, and realise maybe we don't always know what's best b) we're fed up of satan nicking everything that God says is ours c) we don't let other people's thoughts and opinions control us. At that point, we're ready to give God permission to take control and sort us out.
Faith shows its real power when there are no options left; Joshua wouldn't have needed God to split a river in half if there were bridges all around, would he? So often, it's only when there's nothing obvious we can do that we start trusting God to do the impossible. Why not shake up your faith today and trusting Him in everything? You may feel under pressure, but with God on your side, you'll get stronger every day.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU MUST NOT GIVE SIN A VOTE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 6:12 TM</span><br>Have you ever stuffed yourself on a Maccy D's 'til you're so full you're gonna explode? Or Christmas dinner; you couldn't eat another mouthful until someone opens a tin of Quality Street, and you just can't stop yourself. One won't hurt. You know you don't need it, but you have one anyway; then another... and another... and then you start on your selection box! Before you know it, you're feeling really ill. You know it's bad for you but you can't stop yourself; it's addictive. Sin is a bit like that, you know when something's wrong, when it's bad for you. But just like those chocolates, what might not seem too bad to start with is addictive, and once you start, it's hard to stop. The Bible says don't even go there! Your old way of life was nailed to the cross with Jesus; that means your sin too. When Jesus died, He took sin down with Him. Alive, He brings God to us. Do you get it? With God on your side, you can resist the temptation. So, throw yourself at doing things God's way. Remember, sin isn't inevitable for us anymore; Jesus has sent us His Spirit to help us every day, the same Spirit that raised from the dead (Ephesians 1:19-20). So come on; don't be a chocoholic. Turn your back on that stuff, you've got God on your side.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ADULLAM...WHERE...ALL WHO WERE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK CAME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 22:1-2 TM</span><br>Have you ever had one of those days? Nothing's going right, you woke up with crazy hair and a huge zit on your chin, you've just been dumped, you're skint and you've get shed-loads of dull, dull, dull homework to do, when you were supposed to be going out. You've just had enough. You're fed up. You feel like life is pointless. It's times like that, when everything's pants, that it would be really easy just to run away, wallow in a big soggy bog of self pity, put on your most depressing CD and sit in the dark until it's all over. But there's something else you could do instead. God is there watching everything you're going through, just waiting to help you through it. Shelter in God and do what David did, make that cave a place of getting to know God better.  If you're stuck for words, then why not start like David did? 'Be good to me, God; and now! I've run to you for dear life. I'm hiding out under Your wings until the hurricane blows over.  He sends orders from heaven and saves me, he humiliates those who kick me around' (Psalm 57:1-3 TM). Are you feeling down on your luck today? Do you see yourself as damaged goods? Instead of wandering alone in the wilderness, come in and find what you need in God's presence.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ADULLAM...WHERE...ALL WHO WERE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK CAME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 22:1-2 TM</span><br>Ever felt like you don't fit in? Everything around you is falling apart? No-one wants to know? David knew just how you feel. Things got so bad for him, he was completely abandoned and ended up living in the wilderness. When life's tough you may well feel like that but have hope; it doesn't end there. God won't leave you to swelter in the heat; He'll send help if you ask, but it may not come in the way you expect... 
When David was at rock bottom, he went and hid out in a cave called 'Adullam'. He asked God to sort it out and boy did He sort it! God sent David help from the most unexpected places; discontented people, in distress, in debt. 'Each day men came to David to help him. They came until there was a great army, like the army of God' (1 Chronicles 12:22 NLV). Suddenly he had a huge army; things were looking up. Sometimes God will surprise you with who He sends to help. Don't chuck people away like a bit of rubbish just because they're not 'your kind of person'. He can, and does, use the most unexpected people, and won't leave you by yourself if you ask for help.
Why not flip things around today and welcome those odd ones out; you could be helping someone out of their wilderness. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GET YOUR LIFE FROM ME. THEN I WILL LIVE IN YOU AND YOU WILL GIVE MUCH FRUIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:5 NLV</span><br>Have you ever really struggled with someone? I'm talking a make-you-grit-your-teeth-'cos-they-wind-you-up-so-much kind of struggle? No matter how much you try, you just can't like them? John 15 challenges us about that. We might not love, or even like someone; but can Jesus love them through us? With Jesus' help, can we get over our issues with people? Yes, with Jesus living in us we can. As branches we bear fruit, but it's the vine that gives us the nourishment to be able to do that. If we try to make our own fruit, we may as well just go and buy one of those ugly wax-fruit bowl decoration things, because it'd be as much use.
'Jesus living in you' isn't some freaky thing when you unzip your body and He steps into your belly! It's just another way of describing Him being your best mate; the two of you really knowing each other well. If your mate only ever came round when their life was pants, and if they always yakked on to you, but never listened, you probably wouldn't count them as your best mate. Your relationship with Jesus is the same; He wants to know the little things that make you tick, He wants to share the good times with you as well as the bad, He wants to spend time with you. So let Jesus live in you today.  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIDER SKILLFULLY GRASPS WITH ITS HANDS, AND IS IN KINGS' PALACES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:28 (NKJV)</span><br>The size of the spider doesn't determine its potential - sometimes the smallest are the deadliest! Don't make the mistake of thinking you can't make a difference just because you're young. Jesus challenged us all to '... go and make followers of all people in the world' (Matthew 28:19 NCV). That means you! You can have a huge impact among your friends - just as spiders (no matter how big or small) shoot out threads, you need to be sending out the message of Jesus. You might not feel like your web is as strong as your mate's, or your youth leader but that's not the point. The point is to share the message whatever the result. 'Some other seed ... grew and produced a crop. Some plants made a hundred times more, some made sixty times more, and some made thirty times more' (Matthew 13:8 NCV). Should you expect exactly the same results as your mates do when you tell others? No. The results are up to God. So don't be freaked out coz your mate brought five new guys to church and you've only invited one. We don't all produce the same; but we do have to produce at some level. You're only accountable for what God gives you! These things can take time. Be encouraged by the little differences, and, by the grace of God, keep making that web!  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIDER SKILLFULLY GRASPS WITH ITS HANDS, AND IS IN KINGS' PALACES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:28 (NKJV)</span><br>We've all heard the rhyme 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.' If you've been on the bad end of some hurtful words, you'll know just how wrong that is. What comes out of your mouth can be deadly. Some tiny spiders have so much venom in them, they can kill a fully grown human. Your words may not be quite that deadly, but what comes out of your mouth can have a huge effect on your life and on others too. 'Words kill, words give life; they're either poison or fruit. You choose' (Proverbs 18:21 TM).
Words are like seeds; they produce fruit. Don't let your mouth be giving out rotten apples. So how can you make sure that what you say is good? By checking what's going in: if good stuff goes in, good will come out; if filth goes in, filth comes out. And how do you know what's good? By reading God's Word, the Bible. 
If you're struggling with what you're saying, then follow Jesus' example. Know God's word, and speak it. See what Jesus said and did, and try and make that true for you; you might surprise yourself with the difference you see. 'The Devil left. And in his place, angels! Angels came and took care of Jesus' needs' (Matthew 4:11 TM). When you speak God's Word, you get all heaven on your side!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIDER SKILLFULLY GRASPS WITH ITS HANDS, AND IS IN KINGS' PALACES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:28 (NKJV)</span><br>Q: How come if you walk into a spiders web, it sticks to you like glue; gets stuck in your hair, on your clothes, everywhere, but a spider can walk across its web and not get stuck? 
A: Oil! A spiders suction-cup feet seep out greasy oil with every step, so it glides through stuff others can't survive or get bogged down in. 
Sometimes life can seem a bit like the toughest army obstacle course. There are things to catch you out everywhere, walls you don't think you'll ever get over. It can look impossible at first glance; it may even be that even church feels like that to you now and then. That's when we can look at the spider for advice! You need to be continually greased with the oil of God's Spirit! That's what'll help you just glide on through what could be really sticky situations. Everyone's always telling you that fat is bad for you, well that may be so but God's oil is good! The psalmist got his strength from God in the same way: 'But you have made me as strong as an ox. You have poured fine oils on me' (Psalm 92:10 NCV). So before you leave home every morning get down on your knees and pray, 'God, give me fresh oil.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIDER SKILLFULLY GRASPS WITH ITS HANDS, AND IS IN KINGS' PALACES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:28 (NKJV)</span><br>There are thousands of varieties of spiders all specialised in different ways. Some of them are great hunters.  Weird as it sounds, it's their hairy legs rather than their eyes that help! They have super-sensitive hair follicles, so they can feel everything that's going on around them. We're kind of similar; not that we all have super-sensitive hairy legs (although some of us might!), but we have the Holy Spirit to help us see what's going on around us. We can 'see' more by the Spirit than we can with our natural eyes. There may be times when everything around looks hopeless, but God shows you the way; so never give up. 'You have the gift that the Holy One gave you, so you all know the truth' (1 John 2:20 NCV). When you're hanging out with your mates and they're doing stuff you're not sure about, you'll know in your heart if it's wrong. 'Christ gave you the Holy Spirit and He lives in you. You do not need anyone to teach you. The Holy Spirit is able to teach you all things. What He teaches you is truth and not a lie. Live by the help of Jesus as the Holy Spirit has taught you' (1 John 2:27 NLT). The way to make the most of life is to stay close to God. So go on; grow yourself some holy hairy legs!  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIDER SKILLFULLY GRASPS WITH ITS HANDS, AND IS IN KINGS' PALACES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:28 (NKJV)</span><br>When a spider lays eggs, it doesn't just lay them anywhere; it prepares a safe place for them. It spins a protective silk sack, then tucks them safely away. When a predator sneaks up to try and nick the babies, it gets in a tangled mess on the sticky fluids that line the silk. Mama spiders are totally committed to protecting their family. So what's the meaning for us? Well firstly, there are predators out there and we need protection. Here's where you need imagination, think of every one of your prayers as sticky silk threads covering yourself and your family. Just like that spider's eggs are protected so are you; by the power of prayer.
When the Israelites saw a bunch of giants in the land God had promised them, they turned into a bunch of crumbly wimps wanting to run away - but not Caleb. He saw past the fear 'Don't be afraid of the people in that land! We will chew them up ... the Lord is with us' (Numbers 14:9 NCV). That's fighting talk! You see, he knew what he was fighting for; his future, his promised land; and knew it was worth it. So, take a leaf out of Caleb's book and realise that every day you're battling for your future. Like Kanye West said 'Now that, that don't kill me, can only make me stronger...'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIDER SKILLFULLY GRASPS WITH ITS HANDS, AND IS IN KINGS' PALACES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:28 (NKJV)</span><br>Everything a spider needs to survive and succeed in life, God put inside it. Swipe it off a table and before it hits the ground, its fall is broken. It just reaches inside, releases another silk-like thread, slides down, finds a safe place, then comes back stronger than ever and builds a new web. What's the message of the spider? Everything you need, God has placed within you! The Bible says, 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness...he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature' (2 Peter 1:3-4 NIV). What has God given us? 'Everything we need.' What has God made us part of? 'His divine nature.' Wow! Your future isn't determined by how popular you are, but by level of obedience to God's plan for your life. So, 'Stir up...the...gift of God...that is in you' (2 Timothy 1:6 AMP). In other words, start producing!
Life may have knocked you down but it hasn't knocked you out. God's Spirit is inside you and is stronger than what's going on around you. Stand on God's Word, draw on your faith, hold on, and when the smoke clears, rise up and say, 'By the grace of God, I'm back!' As long as you have His Spirit within you, you can make it!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE ENABLES ME TO STAND ON THE HEIGHTS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 18:33 (NIV)	</span><br>'Go' is small word but it packs a powerful punch! When Jesus sent His disciples into the world to preach the gospel He told them to 'Go!' Has it dawned on you yet that God has called you to blaze the trail and set the pace? But you say, 'Nobody in my family has ever done anything like this before.' Good, then you'll be the first! Who are you going to listen to? The voices of your past or the God who is saying to you, 'Be strong and courageous...for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go' (Joshua 1:9 NIV). Having people who think your ideas are crazy is just part of every success story. When God moves, He doesn't call for a vote on it first. No, He looks for somebody like Isaiah to say, 'Here am I. Send me!' (Isaiah 6:8 NIV). Then He revs them up with the Holy Spirit and sends them out to be 'A leader among the nations...and not a follower.&quot; (Deut 28:13 CEV)
Remember that the people God uses are people He can trust with success; people who say, 'He enables me to stand on the heights'. So today, instead of following, lead the way! If you keep hoping someone will take you by the hand and tell you how it's all going to work out, you'll never get anywhere.

Check this out: '&quot;I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows)&quot;'. So many people live with the lid on their life. All the creativity and adventure are stored away and never used. Why? Because they're scared that if they take the lid off they might lose what they've got. Here's the killer question: who created the boundary of your comfort zone? A hundred to one says it wasn't God! Most boundaries come about because we're scared of what other people might think. One of the saddest things to say about somebody is, 'They had such potential'. But nothing about potential is definite. You could live your whole life full of potential but never do anything with it. Don't be that person today. God has filled you with His life and with that He's given you His Holy Spirit, who helps you to get on and do the things He challenges you about. You belong to God and He's poured Himself into you, but not so you can hold onto it for yourself, it's so that you can share His life with others. So lift the lid today and live life to the max!]]></introtext>

We hear scientists discuss 'infinite space' and sports commentators talk about an athlete's boundless energy or we say things like, 'that person has unlimited wealth', but neither of these statements are, in fact, true. Why? Because all those things are created and anything that is created can be measured; weight, distance, length or depth! Author AW Tozer said, 'Measurement is a way that created things have for accounting for themselves.' God is the only one who is without limits. You can't measure His vastness and you can't contain Him in anyway. God wasn't created. He is the 'Ancient of Days' and He has set certain laws in place. The law of 'Gravity', the law of 'Motion' but the most exciting thing He has done is this, Listen: 'For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord!' Awesome!! Nothing measured or created can have power over your position in Christ! There's no boundary He can't cross to get to you and no end to His unfailing love for you. Isn't it awesome to belong to Him?

The law of ?Gravity?, the law of ?Motion? but the most exciting thing He has done is this, Listen: ?For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord!? Awesome!! Nothing measured or created can have power over your position in Christ! There?s no boundary He can?t cross to get to you and no end to His unfailing love for you. Isn?t it awesome to belong to Him? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE CHOSE THE WEAK THINGS OF THIS WORLD TO PUT THE POWERFUL TO SHAME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 1:27</span><br>A lot of people spend time trying to work out 'Who am I?'. For Christian the question is slightly different, 'Whose am I?' When you invited Jesus into your life, everything changed. For starters you're not an outsider anymore but a fully accepted member of God's family, with an open door to your heavenly Father and all the cool stuff that goes with that. Knowing whose you are allows you to live your life from a place of strength and not weakness, faith and not fear. Yes you still have limitations but you won't be afraid of getting things wrong; you'll be secure enough in God's strength to let Him step in and help you when you're stuck. All this raises that age-old question; why does God use 'weak' people? Because weak people are aware of their need for help! 'Weak' people pray to God differently! They remember where they were when God found them and what He brought them through, and they say, 'It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect' (Psalm 18:32 NKJ).[k1] That old geezer Job knew whose he was and it made it possible for him to not give up even when it hurt. Listen: 'I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread' (Job 23:12 AMP). You belong to God, treasure that today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ANTS - THEY AREN'T STRONG BUT THEY STORE UP FOOD ALL SUMMER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:25 NLT</span><br>Ants are incredible little creatures and we can learn loads from how they behave. For example, humans get into to debt by flashing their credit cards and spending money they haven't got, but ants collect food in the summer to see them through the winter. They're prepared for the change in the season. Things in life change; you'll have tough times and then other times your life might feel like a walk in the park. When things are easy it's tempting to take your foot off the prayer pedal and forget your relationship with God, but don't!  God is more than just a 'get out of jail free' card. He isn't there just to bail you out when things get tough. If you invest in your relationship with God through the good and the bad it's like you dig deep wells in your heart and as you spend time with God he fills them with all that you need to get through any thing life throws at you.  'Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid...the Lord is my strength and my song...with joy you will draw from the wells of salvation.' (Isaiah 12:2-4 NIV) God is your strength, God is your comforter, God fills your heart with gladness and your mind with all of His goodness. What ever the season, draw from Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AND WE KNOW THAT IN ALL THINGS GOD WORKS FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:28</span><br>A mum was stunned when her little boy ran crying into the house clutching his hand that was covered in blood. 'Let me see' she said. Backing away he cried, 'No, you'll hurt me.' When he finally opened his hand, instead of a major injury she saw a tiny scrape that bled a lot. Later she laughed to herself at how dramatic he'd been over something so small. Then she realised she'd done the same to God. When her marriage ran into difficulties, she refused to pray. God kept saying, 'Let me help you,' but she just backed away to hide her pain and nurse her wounds. Because she was hurting she panicked thinking that God would do the same to her too. She clenched her fists and said, 'No, you'll hurt me.' Once she realised that this is what she'd done, she gave her pain to God and her healing began. 
Today, give your situation to God, take your hands off it completely, refuse to discuss it any further, and trust the One who makes 'all things work together for good' (Romans 8:28). That's how prayer makes it possible for you to stop struggling with the situation and have peace about it; once you've handed it over to God it's no longer your problem. You can leave it with Him and trust that He'll work the situation out for your good.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUT YOU WANT COMPLETE HONESTY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:6 CEV</span><br>Panicked prayer as a last resort isn't how we're meant to communicate with God. Prayer is your day to day conversation with Jesus, but that said, nothing can fuel prayer like real need. In a crisis, even people who publicly say they don't believe in God, pray secretly. Praying admits that there are certain things we can't fix on our own. Listen: 'When I was in deep trouble, I searched for the Lord. All night long I prayed with hands lifted towards heaven' (Psalm 77:2 NLT). God isn't interested in nice prayers said for show or because it's what we think it's what we ought to pray. God is moved by the cry of our hearts. So don't try to pull the wool over God's eyes. He knows how you really feel so what's the point in pretending. You'll find that you'll start to see results when you pray the minute you get honest with God. Check this out: 'But you want complete honesty' (Psalm 51:6). What tasty fruit does honesty produce in your life? Well for starters, trustworthiness and freedom to name a few. It also gets rid of the hold that fear can have in your heart. If you've nothing to hide then you've nothing to fear! How exciting is that! Why don't you talk to Him today; don't be afraid. He loves you and He's listening!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T LET THE WORLD...SQUEEZE YOU INTO ITS OWN MOULD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:2 PHP</span><br>Do you ever feel like a square peg in a round hole? It can be a frustratingly familiar feeling for Christians living in today's world. But listen: Don't let the world...squeeze you into its own mould.' If you're feeling 'squeezed,' here's what to do: Be transformed: The Bible says, 'Don't be like the people of this world, but let God change the way you think.' (Rom 12:2 CEV). Instead be transformed into the faith-driven person God meant you to be. But how? By renewing your mind:  Instead of struggling to change the stuff around you, change how you think. 'Renewing' means to line up your thoughts with God's. Kick out those self-defeating thoughts that tell you 'you're not, you can't, and you'll never be able to.' God says: 'You are, you can and you will be able to,' because of His power that lives in you! John writes, 'Every child of God can defeat the world, and our faith is what gives us this victory' (1 John 5:4 CEV). Go to God's Word! Find out what He says about the things that hassle you, then pull the plug on them. The Word for you today is: 'don't be afraid...I am your God. I will make you strong...I will support you' (Isaiah 41:10 NCV). How cool is that? You've got the big cheese on your side and He's got your back, forever!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T GET WORKED UP ABOUT...TOMORROW.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:34 TM</span><br>Author, Max Lucado says, 'Worry is to joy, what a vacuum cleaner is to dirt; you might as well attach your heart to a happiness-sucker and flip the switch.' Jesus said, 'Don't get worked up about...tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.' When it looks like things are falling apart, Paul reminds us, 'Every detail in our lives... is worked into something good' (Rom 8:28 TM). When it seems like the world's gone mad, don't forget God 'existed before anything else, and he holds all creation together' (Col 1:17 NLT). When worry whispers, 'God doesn't know what you need,' remember God promised to 'take care of everything you need' (Philippians 4:19 TM).
Jesus taught us to pray, 'Give us this day our daily bread.' That means you won't get extra 'just in case' tomorrow's problems come early. God's desire is that every day we would 'go confidently to the throne... [to] find kindness, which will help us at the right time' (Hebrews 4:16 GWT). 
Over a century ago preacher Charles Spurgeon said: 'Enough for today is all we can enjoy. We cannot eat, drink, or wear more than today's supply of food and clothing. The surplus gives us the care of storing it and the anxiety that someone might steal it... When our Father doesn't give you more, be content with your daily allowance.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU DID IT TO ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:40 NAS</span><br>A pastor walking down Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, USA, noticed a homeless man coming towards him. He was filthy and his beard was caked with rotten food. He was holding a dirty cup of coffee. Staggering up to him the man exclaimed, 'Hey, mister. You want some of my coffee?' The pastor didn't, but he thought it was the right thing to do, so he said, 'Sure, I'll take a sip.' Handing the cup back the pastor remarked, 'You're generous giving away your coffee,' to which the man replied, 'Well, it was particularly delicious today, and I think if God gives you something that good you should share it!' The pastor remembers: 'I figured I was being set up and it would cost me five bucks. So I said, &quot;Is there something I can do for you in return?&quot; The homeless man answered, &quot;Yeah, you can give me a hug!&quot; He put his arms around me, and I realised he wasn't going to let go! People passed by and stared at me. There I was, hugging this smelly street guy! I was embarrassed. But slowly embarrassment changed to awe. I heard a voice saying, &quot;I was hungry; did you feed Me? I was naked; did you clothe Me? I was homeless on Chestnut Street, Philadelphia...did you hug me? If you did...you did it to Me.&quot;'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CONSIDER HIM WHO ENDURED SUCH OPPOSITION...SO THAT YOU WILL NOT...LOSE HEART</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:3 NIV</span><br>Are you feeling misunderstood? You're not alone! The most misunderstood person who ever lived was Jesus. Critics joked about His birth, disputed His divinity, scorned His purposes, despised His teachings, were suspicious of His motives, critical of His methods and angered by His message. Ultimately they put Him to death on a cross! That explains what the Apostle John meant when he wrote, 'The Light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it...He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him' (John 1:5-10 NIV). Wherever He went, Jesus met with misunderstanding and rejection. Yet in spite of it, He hung in there. And by His grace you can too! 
Listen: 'So we must get rid of everything that slows us down...And we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us...So keep your mind on Jesus, who put up with all sorts of idiotic insults. Then you won't get discouraged and give up. (Heb 12:1-3 CEV). So, as you run your race today: a) recognise the things that slow you down b) recognise the things that trip you up c) recognise that obstacles and opposition are 'par for the course', and don't give up! How do you do this? By keeping your eyes on Jesus and drawing strength from Him each day.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE WILL COME TO HIM AND MAKE OUR HOME WITH HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 14:23 AMP</span><br>If you've given your heart to Jesus and you love Him, listen to what he says he'll do, &quot;If a person [really] loves Me, he will keep My word [put My teaching into practice]; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him..&quot; You have the Prince of Peace living in your heart by the Holy Spirit. Listen: 'Do not be anxious about anything.' (Phil 4:6 NIV) Paul made this statement because he knew that people get stressed and worried; but he also knew that they didn't have to. Why not? Because he understood the power of having Jesus living inside! Paul had experienced the reality, that when things don't go according to plan, or if trouble comes to town, you can be at peace in your heart. Peace isn't a feeling, it's a person. And that person is Jesus. So when things are getting stressful you don't have to light a scented candle and lie down in a deep bath to find peace; you just have to talk to Jesus (or talk to him in the bath and get the best of both!). Pray: 'Jesus, I feel stressed today and overwhelmed by what I need to do. Your Word says that You are my peace (Ephesians 2:14) so I trust in You today. Be all that I can't be. Thank You, Father.' ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT REQUIRES A CERTAIN APTITUDE AND GRACE. MARRIAGE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 19:11 TM</span><br>Isn't this a bit of a funny subject for a teenage Bible magazine? Maybe, but when was the last time you caught yourself daydreaming about some hot guy or girl, wondering what that 'you may now kiss the bride' moment really feels like? A week ago, a day ago, a second ago? Right, so this is for you then!  
One marriage counsellor observes, 'Society has made romantic feelings the basis for marriage.' There's nothing wrong with romance but there is so much more needed to make a marriage last. Romance is dependant on physical appearance.  Romantic love is exciting, but that does mean that relationships based purely on romance can be shallow. Emotions can be so overpowering that they can cloud your good judgement. A marriage is what you create after the wedding. It doesn't just happen. You have to build it with, patience, support, compromise, a good friendship and a 'love marked by giving, not getting' (Ephesians 5:21-28 TM). That's why Jesus said, 'Not everyone is mature enough to live a married life. It requires a certain aptitude and grace. Marriage isn't for everyone...if you're capable of growing into the largeness of marriage, do it.' On the other hand, a wife / husband partnership with Jesus at the centre of their relationship can be something amazing that makes society's definition of romance look lightweight by comparison. Feel free to daydream about that today! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WATCH WHAT GOD DOES, THEN DO IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Eph 5:1 TM</span><br>Face it; life would be easy if we didn't have to deal with people. But people matter to God and they should matter to us! Like being part of a family and knowing what's best for your own children, you need to spend time getting to know the people who depend on you and look up to you. Learn what makes them tick and what they're passionate about. Try and find ways to encourage them, instead of seeing them as time consuming and a lot of effort. God always has time for you, any time, day or night and never makes you feel like an inconvenience to Him. Jesus spent most of His time with people, not talking in 'holier-than thou' clichés, but loving and encouraging them. And He said, 'Love each other as I...loved you' (John 13:34 NCV). It's always easier to ask people to do something, when you're behaving the same way in your own life. But how do you learn how to behave? Check this out: &quot;Watch what God does, and then you do it, like children who learn proper behaviour from their parents.... Keep company with him and learn a life of love. Observe how Christ loved us. His love was not cautious but extravagant. He didn't love in order to get something from us but to give everything of himself to us. Love like that (Ephesians 5:1-5 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF A MAN IS OVERTAKEN IN ANY TRESPASS...RESTORE SUCH A ONE IN A SPIRIT OF GENTLENESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:1 NKJV</span><br>The word trespass comes from the word 'misstep,' which means to take a step in the wrong direction or to make a wrong choice. When you lose your footing or you slip; you didn't intend to fall but now it's happened and you need some help to get up again. That's what the Bible talks about when it says, 'Restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.' In Greek the word 'restore' has two parts to its meaning:
1) Resetting a broken bone: Paul says, 'Christ makes us one body...connected to each other' (Romans 12:5 GWT). Family is important for your growth and development, and so is your spiritual family, because your spiritual family will last forever. By helping a brother or sister get back on track, you help to heal their pain, get their focus back on Jesus and His purpose for their lives, so they can become a vital, functioning part of the body of Christ again.
2) Removing a tumour: Cancerous tumours are life-threatening and spiritual tumours are soul-threatening. By removing one you will help save somebody and you'll obey the word. Listen: 'You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand.' (Galatians 6:2 CEV). In God's army we aren't supposed to shoot our wounded. If the wounded can't find help in their own family, where are they going to find it?]]></introtext>

But what if they've messed up in public and provided ammunition for the critics who already think all Christians are hypocrites? Why bother with somebody like that?
Firstly, the Bible says, 'If a man is overtaken [caught by surprise]...[consider] yourself lest you also be tempted.' If it happened to you you'd want somebody to help you, right? Paul says, 'We are just as capable of messing it up as they were. Don't be so...self-confident...You could fall flat on your face as easily as anyone else' (1 Corinthians 10:12 TM). He's absolutely right isn't he.
Secondly, because Jesus is your example. While He had no time for the super-spiritual who hid their sins underneath a respectable religious mask, not once did He condemn anybody who was 'overtaken' by temptation and failure. When they repented He forgave and restored them. Bible boffin Victor Shepherd writes: 'When we're face-to-face with someone who's been surprised because trespass overtook them, do we deflect their shame back into their face, or do we own it as ours? Do we rub their nose in it, or do we absorb it, put an arm around them and affirm our solidarity-in-sinnership? Do we regard ourselves as superior, or do we say, &quot;Take my hand...I know the way to the cross?&quot;' You know the answer to that.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 112:1 NIV</span><br>Psalm 112 is a description of what it means to live in God's blessings. The first verse is the door you walk through to get them. 'Blessed is the man who fears the Lord...' This sort of fear isn't about being scared, it's about trusting, honouring and obeying.' It goes on, 'who finds great delight in his commands,' that means taking pleasure in what God says, then doing it. You can't do anything to earn God's love but you must obey Him to live in His blessings. So what's through the door? 
'His children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for the gracious and compassionate and righteous man. Good will come to him who is generous and lends freely, who conducts his affairs with justice. Surely he will never be shaken; a righteous man will be remembered forever. He will have no fear of bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord. His heart is secure, he will have no fear; in the end he will look in triumph on his foes. He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor, his righteousness endures forever; his horn [name] will be lifted high in honour' (Psalm 112: 2-9 NIV). That's what it means to be blessed!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 10:38</span><br>Have you been on a plane when it all starts getting a bit bumpy and wobbly? You don't immediately rush for the emergency escape door do you? No, you sit tight and trust the pilot. Faith's a bit like that. 
Walking by faith doesn't mean your problems suddenly evaporate. In fact, when you make up your mind to put your faith in God the odds will often be stacked against you. But check this out: before faith changes your circumstances, it changes you by giving you the strength to hang in there. Faith gives you the mental and emotional strength to get through stuff, confident that God is working on your behalf. 'Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.' (Hebrews 11:1-2 NIV). 
In practical terms faith means: a) totally trusting God b) following in the footsteps of ordinary people who did extraordinary things c) flexing your faith, because it's power from heaven. When the Bible says, 'The just shall live by faith,' it doesn't mean little bursts every now and again. No, it's talking about a lifestyle! Most boxers survive the first few rounds in the ring; only the best can get knocked down in the ninth and still get back up to fight on and win. So forget your circumstances, diss your doubts and start punching by faith!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD IS MAKING NEW LIFE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 COR 4:17 (TM)</span><br>In our life we are overwhelmed with 'information'. But so often information isn't what we need. What we need to face the challenges of life is 'formation', the shaping of our lives into the people God destined us to be. The responsibility for this formation belongs to the Holy Spirit, the living, active presence of God who is with us every second of every minute of every day, concerned with every detail of our development. 
Paul writes, 'Every detail works to your advantage...So we're not giving up. How could we! Even though on the outside it often looks like things are falling apart on us, on the inside, where God is making new life, not a day goes by without his unfolding grace' (2 Corinthians 4:15-17 TM). Note the words, 'we're not giving up.' Any time we want to move forward, obstacles are going to get in the way, and God's Word teaches us that we should expect nothing less. The author HG Wells asked, 'What on earth would a man do with himself if something didn't stand in his way?' Why did he say that? Because pushing against stuff strengthens our muscles! Each obstacle we overcome teaches us something new. We start shaping up, getting smarter and more confident. Check history, the greatest people were those who faced the most difficult challenges and found their true selves in the process!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ACT WITH COURAGE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CHRONICLES 19:11 NIV</span><br>You only find out if you've got courage when you start doing stuff that feels a bit scary: 
1) Courage usually involves getting it wrong before you get it right. It's easy to be brave where you're strong; it's more difficult where you're weak! An army General once remarked, 'Bravery is the capacity to perform properly, even when scared half to death.' We see that in the prayer of Jesus the night before his crucifixion, he faced all the horror of the cross, freaked at the prospect, then said, 'Come on then!' 
2) Courage always takes the 'high road'. Jesus said, 'If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also' (Matthew 5:39 NIV). Dr James B Mooneyham writes, 'When we keep score of wrongs committed against us, we reveal a lack of maturity.' Those who don't forgive are people who haven't learned this truth, and they tend not to be courageous people. If you want to improve this area of your life, here are some advice: First, think good thoughts of that person. It's difficult to have bad feelings for someone who you can see good in. Finally, let people know through your actions that you can forgive and forget. This will win their respect for you. Remember this: 'taking revenge makes you even with your enemy; forgiving him sets you above.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ACT WITH COURAGE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CHRONICLES 19:11 NIV</span><br>The English word for courage comes from the French word for 'heart.' That's why we say, 'Don't lose heart.' The truth is: 
1) It takes courage to face the truth about yourself. Jesus said, 'You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free' (John 8:32 NKJV). But the process of setting us free usually involves facing the truth about ourselves, which isn't always something we like hearing. 
2) It takes courage to change when staying as you are feels more comfortable. If you're willing to leave your security to follow God, you'll be tested, but you'll also reach heights you thought were beyond you. 
3) It takes courage to stand up for your beliefs when you know they'll be challenged. Any time you stand for something, or try something, somebody will take a shot at you. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, 'Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon there's always someone to tell you you're wrong. There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to the end, requires the same courage a soldier needs.' When Nehemiah's enemies threatened him he said, 'Should a man like me run away?... I will not' (Nehemiah 6:11 NIV). As a result he rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem in 52 days and shamed his enemies. That's courage.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 11:29 NIV</span><br>One of the greatest promises Jesus ever gave us was, 'Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls' (Matthew 11:28-29 NIV). To understand why that's such a great promise we need to know what a yoke is, which is this: a wooden harness that hooks around the necks of two oxen so they can pull a load. But just a minute, how could Jesus talk about being yoked in a harness, which suggests hard work, and about rest, in the same breath? Well, there's more: In a pair of oxen one is the leader and the other follows. You see, Jesus will take the lead but you must be hooked up to Him to get the benefit. To progress through the tough fields of life, you have to be fully fastened in to your Lord. And Jesus promises that His yoke won't choke you or chafe you. 
So there is a paradox at the heart of this promise: if you want to be truly free you must allow yourself to be fastened in to Jesus. Oh yes, it's possible to get hooked up then start pulling in another direction when the path doesn't go the way you want it to. But peace only comes when you relax in the yoke, and let Jesus lead the way.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FERVENT IN SPIRIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:11 </span><br>Tim Dumler needed a job and he got an opportunity to go into sales. At the interview he said his goal was to become the number one employee. The company were sceptical as he had a severe sight impairment, in fact he was 'legally blind'. But, despite their misgivings, they took a chance on him. And it's a good thing they did. He came in early, worked late and within six years became their top producer. His clients loved him because when you're blind you become a great listener. His workmates loved him because of his caring, positive attitude. He said, 'It's unfortunate that I'm visually impaired but adversity made me a better person. I have a lot more than I don't have.' Tim has the 100 degree attitude!
What's the 100-degree attitude? It's this: At 99 degrees Celsius, water is scalding hot, but at 100 degrees it boils. With boiling water comes steam. And steam can power a train! One extra degree makes all the difference in life. This is the way the Bible describes the 100 degree attitude: 'Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does' (Ephesians 6:7-8 NIV). And by the way, God promises to reward this attitude, with rewards you don't have to wait until you get to heaven to enjoy! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE GOSPEL...IS THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 1:16</span><br>A man was standing at King's Cross in Sydney, Australia when a shabby looking character tapped him and said 'If you died tonight, where would you be spending eternity?' This question haunted the man and he eventually gave his life to Jesus. Years later he heard a lady in his church tell almost the same story about herself. He returned to the place and found the old man. He explained how it had impacted him and the lady in his church. The shabby man explained that he used to be a drunk before Jesus saved him. He wasn't educated or gifted so all he could think to do was to ask that question. He'd done it for eight years and it was the first time he realised it ever made a difference. 
Some people hear the gospel and come to Christ straight away but for most of us it's a much longer, and messier route. Our job is not to change people, it's to share what we know, to challenge people, and let God do the changing. It's not your responsibility to save your friends, but it is your responsibility to share Jesus with them and let them make their own choice. Thousands of testimonies start with 'there was this Christian kid at school'. It's often years later that they accept Jesus, but the seed was planted there. Don't be afraid, plant the seed! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE PRAYER OF FAITH SHALL SAVE THE SICK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:15</span><br>When a pastor visited a lady in a nursing home, she asked him to pray for her healing. So he did. Then she said, 'Would you help me out of this wheelchair?' Startled, he did as she asked. She took a few steps then started running and jumping until the whole building heard her. Later in his car the pastor looked up and said, 'Lord, don't ever do that to me again!' The Bible says, 'The prayer of faith shall save the sick.' So why are we surprised when He does?
A visiting preacher told the congregation if anyone needed prayer to come forward, but inside he was thinking of all the times he prayed and nothing happened. Later that week a woman called and said, 'Last Sunday you prayed for my husband. He had cancer, and he died.' 'Typical,' he thought. The lady continued, 'When we walked into church my husband was angry. He wanted to see his grandchildren grow up and every day he cursed God. Being around him was unbearable. But after you prayed for him he walked out a different person. His last days were the best we'd ever had; we talked, laughed and sang hymns together. He wasn't cured, but he was healed.' 
Only God knows why some are healed while others aren't. But we're told to pray for the sick and believe they are healed, and the rest is up to God! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL SEE VISIONS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOEL 2:28 CEV</span><br>There's a scene in an old film, Man of La Mancha where the main character and his servant are standing staring at a derelict building. When Don Quixote describes his vision of turrets and magnificent gates, seeing it as almost a palace, the servant, Sancho Panza does his best to see his master's vision but he just can't get past the reality in front of him. When Sancho starts describing the ruins, the Don stops him, saying, 'I will not allow your facts to interfere with my vision!' 
In the last days God has promised to pour out His Spirit on all kinds of different people (not just the ones we think deserve it). He said, 'Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions.' One Bible teacher writes: 'When the Holy Spirit fills us, we have visions that defy facts. When I deal with young people who get a vision of doing something big for God, I can always count on their parents to throw cold water on it. The parents say they want them to be realistic.' Well, whether it's parents or anyone else that insists on pointing out all the 'realities' that mean your vision will never happen, always remember that when God gives visions they often don't make sense at that moment in time. But that's ok, because God is outside time! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FORGIVE...BECAUSE THE LORD FORGAVE YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:13 NCV</span><br>Have you ever witnessed a friend who continually has an issue with someone and just thought 'they really need to get over it'? Holding onto old hurts just makes you bitter. Paul says, 'Forgive...because the Lord forgave you.' Get over it before it turns into hatred! Missionaries to the unreached peoples on the edge of the icy northern polar region searched for a word for forgiveness in the local Eskimo language. That's when they discovered issumagijoujungnainermik, a 24-letter tongue-twister which literally means 'not being able to think about it any more.' Genuine forgiveness is more than just saying 'I forgive you', it's about moving on, refusing to think any more about what happened and in time forgetting about it completely. 
It's easy to forgive someone who accidentally stepped on your foot, but what about those who meant to hurt you? Saul kept chasing David, always trying to kill him; it's hard to forgive that kind of behaviour! But forgiveness didn't necessarily mean that David had to make Saul his best friend. After David finally confronted King Saul, he didn't take him straight down the pub for a pint! The Bible says, 'Saul returned home, but David...went up to the stronghold' (1 Samuel 24:22 NIV). Paul writes, 'Watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way...Keep away from them' (Romans 16:17 NIV). Forgiveness doesn't mean foolishness, not in any language. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANY OF YOU LACKS WISDOM?ASK GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:5 NIV </span><br>If life is looking all a bit too scary and overwhelming at the moment, ask God to help you, then apply these five principles: 
1) Focus on the task. There are some very talented and skilled people who are useless because they can't concentrate on one thing for more than five minutes. If you're trying to achieve something, focus on what you're doing. Don't let every little thing that comes along make you look the wrong way.  
2) Prioritise it by importance. If we don't work out what's most important, we end up chasing our tails and dealing with whatever's the most urgent. By planning out what needs to be done by when you can make sure everything is done with time to spare. If you don't you'll always be behind, stressed out and unable to fit in the things you want to do, like see your mates!  
3) Draw the line. Look at the calendar, give yourself a deadline and stick with it! The biggest lie we tell ourselves is, 'I'll do it later.'  
4) Break it into bite-size chunks. If you split a big job into a bunch of smaller ones it's much easier.   
5) Don't go it alone. Chances are, there's lots of things you'll need to do that people around you also need to do, so team up! Teamwork will act like glue bringing all the rest together.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET EVERY LIVING, BREATHING CREATURE PRAISE GOD!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 150:6 TM</span><br>Why do we worship God? There have been millions of words written on this subject. There are theories about our upbringings, our surroundings, all sorts of ideas about how our minds are wired. The very simple truth is that we worship God because that's a) why were created and b) as humans we naturally worship something that we love! For those of us who've had our lives totally transformed by God, it's obvious we're going to want to worship Him. 
But what is worship? In our today's churches we can get a bit distracted and start thinking worship is all about singing Modern songs with a guitar, when actually our whole lives can be worship to God! People connect with God in hundreds of different ways. For some it's through music but for others it may be wandering in the hills and thanking God for the beauty, or for others it's simply showing love to their friends and family. If you're not a massive fan of church worship, don't worry! There's nothing wrong with you, we're all different! Do your best in church, but also discover what works best for you. What's your in-built instinct for prayer? Where do you want to be? Locked away or watching the sunset? We were made for worship, it's awesome. So take some time to discover what works for you, and then use it to give God praise! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BEAUTY, THE...KIND...GOD DELIGHTS IN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 3:4 TM</span><br>A lady was applying face cream when her little girl asked, 'What's that you're putting on, Mum?' 'Moisturiser,' she replied. 'The saleslady said it would make me beautiful.' With an honesty only children have, she replied, 'Mum, I don't think it's working.' There's nothing at all wrong with looking good, but the question we should ask is why we're so keen to look good? We've all heard the old clichés that beauty is on the inside, but then we turn on the TV, flick through a magazine or stand next to the good-looking kid at school, and we feel like a minger. 
Making an effort with our appearance can help us a feel a bit better, but it's just not enough. You can't let your emotions be ruled by what the scales said this morning! It's so important that you take time to allow God to tell you what he thinks of your appearance. He crafted you, designed you and made you just the way He wants you; so who are you to tell God He didn't do a good enough job?! It's a hugely difficult thing to accept the truth of God's Words when He's talking about us, that He loves us, that we're gorgeous, but unless you do, and start living like it, you'll continue to look in the mirror and feel sad at the reflection. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT GOD FIRST, AND HE WILL?CROWN YOUR EFFORTS WITH SUCCESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:6 TLB</span><br>We all come at life differently. Partly this is down to the fact that we all have different types of parents. Some parents push achievement whatever the cost, others take a 'just try your best' approach and sadly some just don't seem remotely bothered. Whatever your parents are like, it will affect how you view the worth of work. Maybe you think it's not worth trying as you'll just fail anyway, or maybe you really feel you've something to prove. It's true that if you really want something you have to work for it, but at the same time that thing you've worked so hard may not really satisfy you. Imagine training your entire life to win an Olympic gold. Every day training, practising, dreaming. When the day comes and goes and the medal is put on the shelf, now what? Your name may be written in a book but 4 years later, it's someone else's turn. 
Ultimately, all that really matters is doing what God wants you to do and being who He created you to be. If He wants to use an Olympic medal to bring Him glory then great! But if you impact lives by doing something slightly less glamorous than you hoped, you should be satisfied because there's no better place to be than at the centre of God's plan for you! So by all means work hard, but do it for the right reasons!  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET US CONTINUALLY...PRAISE...GOD...GIVING THANKS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 13:15 NKJV</span><br>At a Christian conference they were short of space for 150 people so they brought in some narrower chairs. Everyone had a seat but conditions in the auditorium were cramped and nobody was happy. The organisers asked the guest speaker, Joni Eareckson Tada, to help calm the crowd. A childhood diving accident had left Joni paralysed from the neck down and confined to a wheelchair. She addressed the audience and said: 'I understand some of you don't like the chair you're sitting in. Well, neither do I! But I've a thousand handicapped friends who'd gladly trade places with you.' Immediately the hall went quiet and the complaining stopped. It's so easy to moan but giving thanks, well that can take a bit of effort.
The Bible says, 'Let us continually [not just when you feel like it!] offer the sacrifice of praise to God...giving thanks to His name.' After Bible boffin Matthew Henry was mugged he wrote in his diary, 'Let me be thankful, first, that I was never robbed before, second, that although they took my purse they didn't take my life, third, that although they took everything I had, it wasn't much, fourth, that it was I who was robbed, and not I who did the robbing.' 
When you feel like moaning have a look at Psalm 118:29 'Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever' ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN ALL YOUR WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM, AND HE SHALL DIRECT YOUR PATHS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:6</span><br>One of the most important questions you must ask yourself is, 'What am I supposed to prepare for?' You don't want to be like the Miss America contestant who recently told a late-night TV talk show host, 'My goal is to bring world peace - and get my own apartment.' Ask God what you're supposed to do and keep asking until you get clear instructions as to your next step (or for that matter, your first step!).Check this out: 'In all your ways acknowledge [consult, listen and submit to] him, and he shall direct your paths.' What ultimately matters most will not be what others say about your life but what God says. 
The humbling truth is, whatever you're good at someone will end up being better, records will be broken, reputations will fade and tributes will be forgotten. In college Dr James Dobson's goal was to become the school's tennis champion. He felt very proud when his trophy was prominently placed in a display cabinet. Years later someone sent him a parcel, it contained the trophy; they'd found it in the rubbish bin when the school was being refurbished. Dobson says, 'Given enough time, all your trophies will be trashed by someone else.' You weren't put here to be remembered, you were put here to do God's will and to prepare for eternity. If you're wise you'll keep that in mind! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HOLD ON TO INSTRUCTION...GUARD IT WELL, FOR IT IS YOUR LIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 4:13 NIV</span><br>Phil was gutted, he was parked up on the side of a country road with a flat tyre. The battery had just died on his phone and it was at least an hour walk to the nearest village. There he could use a pay phone to call the AA only to walk for another hour to get back to his car. Phil was kicking himself. Last week his dad had shown him how to change a tyre but Phil was too busy texting Zoe, anyway it looked easy. Now he couldn't remember what his Dad had taught him, it had gone in one ear and out the other. Phil's dad had moaned when he could tell that Phil was more into his mobile than the spare wheel.  'One day you'll thank me for showing me this' he said. At the time Phil had thought 'whatever'; now his dad's words echoed in his mind along with one other word; 'D'OH!!!' 
King Solomon, the writer of Proverbs, tells his son 'hold on to instruction...guard it well'. Its great advice for life. The best way to be prepared for tomorrow is to pay attention to what's going on today especially when it comes to your walk with God. God wants to get you spiritually ready for what's coming. Bible studies, sermons; whatever it is, write some notes, talk about it with mates, but don't forget it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WORK HARD SO YOU CAN...RECEIVE HIS APPROVAL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 2:15 NLT </span><br>Beckham's famous bending and sometimes match winning free kicks were the result of hours of endless practice. Beckham famously would stay at the training ground kicking ball after ball long after the rest of the lads were getting a shower and drink at the bar. Preparation is everything! Moses spent 80 years preparing for a job that would last 40. The greater the goal, the greater the preparation! Whether you're called to business, education, sports, politics, art, medicine or ministry, this principle remains; God uses prepared people. The price tag required for long-term success cannot be lowered. We all want what successful people have; we're just not all willing to pay the price they paid to achieve it. You must be prepared when your opportunities come. President Abe Lincoln said, 'I will prepare and some day my chance will come.' Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli said, 'The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes.' When the fate of the Jews hung in the balance, Mordecai told Esther that her experience in the king's palace had prepared her, 'For such a time as this' (Esther 4:14). She responded and the Jews were saved. All these people had talent, prepared themselves and made the most of their opportunities when they arose. So your greatest challenge is not lack of opportunity, but being ready when it comes. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HOLD THEM IN HIGHEST REGARD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:13 NIV</span><br>Somebody has described the 'Perfect Pastor' as one who preaches 20 minutes and sits down, condemns sin without offending anybody, works 16-hour days doing everything from preaching to sweeping, makes £400 a week and gives £200 back to the church, wears nice clothes, has a model family, supports good causes and helps beggars who stop by the church. He has a burning desire to work with young people and spends all his time with the senior citizens. He's funny but also serious. He makes 20 visits a day, spends every waking moment evangelising and is always in his office in case he's needed. The bad news is, he burned out and died! Paul writes, 'Appreciate...pastoral leaders who gave you the Word' (Hebrews 13:7 TM). 'Honour those...who work so hard for you, who have...the responsibility of...guiding you...Overwhelm them with appreciation and love!' (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13 TM). In other words, support your pastor, youth leader, anyone who 'works so hard for you' Sometimes they might not be perfect, but who CAN be the perfect pastor when so many different people want different things? Instead of moaning or just taking them for granted pelt them with kindness, batter them with words of gratitude and love. Buy them something nice, stick up for them, write an email or letter telling them what they are good at. Go on overwhelm them with appreciation and love. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FORGIVE ANYONE YOU ARE HOLDING A GRUDGE AGAINST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 11:25 NLT</span><br>A Christian teenager was really upset when she heard that a couple of her friends were planning to go to a travelling fair that had pitched up in town but she hadn't been invited. The day before, she got a Facebook invite from one of her other mates who also wanted to go. 'it's too late' she typed in reply 'I've already prayed for rain!' When we are hurt, God doesn't want us to lash out, he wants us to forgive. One night after preaching about forgiveness, Corrie Ten Boom recognised that the man approaching her was a former guard from Ravensbruck, the Nazi prison camp where she was tortured and her sister Betsie starved to death. When he asked her to forgive him, Corrie thought about Betsie and felt she couldn't do it. Nevertheless she knew she must, otherwise everything she'd preached would be meaningless. So she told God, 'I can extend my hand, I can do that much but You'll have to supply the feelings.' Taking the man's hand she felt God's power rushing through her, enabling her to wholeheartedly say, 'I forgive you, brother'. Corrie never experienced God's love as intensely as she did that night. Although she'd been badly tortured, she let God heal her, and then went on to help others. The truth is that forgiveness is the only way to have peace!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THERE WERE NO BLACKSMITHS IN THE LAND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 13:19 NLT</span><br>The Bible says, 'There were no blacksmiths in the land of Israel in those days. The Philistines wouldn't allow them for fear they would make swords and spears for the Hebrews (1 Samuel 13:19-22 NLT). 
To keep the Israelites in slavery, the Philistines removed all the blacksmiths. It was a devastating blow. Blacksmiths had an important job, they made swords to be used in battle and also sickles to be used in the harvest field; without them not only was life a lot harder it was a lot more dangerous. Today, there are so many jobs that are important for our country: doctors, nurses, fire fighters, teachers, politicians, authors, inventors, scientists; to name just a few. Without these jobs the country would be worse off. Sometimes at Christian events or in church people talk about what are you 'called' to. Most of the time we think about people being called to become a missionary, a pastor, a worship leader or an evangelist. God does call some people to those jobs, but it's not all there is. He might be calling you to be a 'blacksmith', a job that will make a real difference in people's lives. God might not have given you the gifts or calling to be a preacher but you could be an awesome scientist! So what is God calling you to do? It could be anything! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ELIJAH WAS......JUST LIKE US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:17 NIV</span><br>Elijah is feeling battered and wants to give up. God doesn't lecture him on being more super spiritual but sorts out some grub, lets him chill out and begins to help Elijah get a true view on things. So: 
1) He adjusted Elijah's View of God . 'Get in the presence of God and he'll meet with you' (1 Kings 19:11 NIV). The One who gave Elijah victory on Mount Carmel, could also help Elijah as he sat feeling desperate in a desert. It's a no brainer; Elijah needed to spend time with God! 
2) He adjusted Elijah's world-view. Elijah said, 'God's covenant is broken, His altar destroyed, His prophets murdered, and I'm the only one left' (1 Kings 19:14). To Elijah everything looked hopeless but God showed Elijah that He was at work and had the bigger picture 
3) He adjusted Elijah's self-perspective. The prophet saw himself as helpless and inadequate: 'Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors. (1 Kings 19:4). But God showed him there were still kings to anoint, battles to win, and that Elijah had an important role to play (v16). 
4) He provided a mate  God sent a guy called Elisha to help.(1 Kings 19:21). You're not supposed to walk alone! Allow yourself to need help, and check out who God puts in your life to support you. 
Today get praying that God will give you a true view.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ELIJAH WAS.....JUST LIKE US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:17 NIV</span><br>We all get down in the dumps now and then. Even the best of us; take Elijah. Fresh from a day's work of calling down fire from Heaven and slaying 850 evil priests and prophets (come on, we've all been there) Elijah gets an award-winning case of the blues. All that adrenalin catches up with him, and whilst his defences are down he gets depressed.
Lesson one: When we're tired we're prime candidates for feeling down. On top of that he starts to lose the plot. After taking on an army of evil, he ends up doing a bunk because of one lousy old crone: Jezebel. Fear makes him get things out of perspective. 
Lesson two: Fear + exhaustion = disillusion.  Finally, he becomes a total misery guts, leaving his servant, and going it alone in the desert. When he most needs support, a friend, someone to pick him up, he chooses the worst company: his own! Listen to how he cheers himself up: 'I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me' (1 Kings 19:10, NIV). 'And the Oscar for best self pitying speech goes to...'
Lesson three: What's that old saying, 'a problem shared is a problem halved'. No microwave meals for one; if the blues set in, get yourself some help from someone who really cares, get yourself hooked up with God, He's got the biggest shoulder to cry on.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUT THE THING THAT DAVID HAD DONE DISPLEASED THE LORD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 SAMUEL 11:27 NKJV</span><br>If you can count on one thing it's:' Be sure your sin will find you out' (Numbers 32:23). Textbook example: David. The King started an affair with his mate's wife. His dirty little secret soon becomes obvious when the she starts showing a bump. So, what does David do;, confess his sins to God? Beg for forgiveness from his mate? Not likely, David tries to cover his tracks by arranging for his mate to be bumped off. Ouch. It looked as though David had got off scott-free, except for one teeny tiny detail. 'The thing that David had done displeased the Lord.' And how do get the righteous, angry Almighty God to keep shtum? 
You can do your best to hide your slip-ups from other people, but you'll never hide from The Lord, He knows and sees everything, including all the stuff you shouldn't be doing.  So we're all doomed!! Well...no...you see God is in the business of sorting things out, but first of all, we need to be honest about where we've messed up. It took the events normally reserved for a Shakespeare tragedy, before David would face the truth with God. But once he did, God got to work on the messy situation. Are you in a mess at the moment? Face the truth. Sort it with God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WILL BE MISSED, BECAUSE YOUR SEAT WILL BE EMPTY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 20:18 NIV</span><br>Imagine waking up one day to find you've been erased from life. You can see and hear people, but as far as they're concerned you're gone. Wouldn't it be a nightmare? You couldn't tell your Mum you loved her because she won't hear. You can't send your Nan flowers because you're not around. You can't even tell your mate at college, 'you know, you're alright you'. Actually, you don't even have to imagine it, because somehow, we never get around to doing those things even though we can be seen and heard. Sometimes we're too busy to think of anybody else, sometimes we just don't think, we just take people for granted that they'll always be there. Sometimes we don't know how to tell people how we really feel. Well, why not start trying.  Put into practice ways of showing people what they mean to us. Start now, put this little mag down, and make your mum a cuppa without her asking. Mow your Nan's lawn this weekend. Buy your mate a special present for no reason other than you love them. 
The clock's ticking and the days are flying by. Jonathon knew that David would not always be around, that's why he took his chance whilst he could to say '...You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.' Don't wait until your loved ones seat is empty; tell them you love them today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DESIRES FOR...THINGS...CHOKE THE WORD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 4:19 NIV</span><br>Surely none of you decent Christian youth-folk have ever seen those worldly films where the twisted, evil psycho-nut ends up strangling the poor innocent faced high school student. We can laugh at them, because we think how could you be so naïve, you never go down to the cellar without a torch, it spells out certain death in a slasher flick.  But the everyday worries of life can do just that to us. Strangle or choke us, and we're so naïve about it.   In the parable of the sower Jesus said, 'Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful' (Mark 4:18-19 NIV). Get a good job; Get a nice house; fast car; holidays abroad; new wardrobe. All these things, though not bad in themselves, can end up choking us if we're not careful. The more you have, the more you have to lose, to protect, to maintain, to worry about. It's the deceitfulness of wealth. If you count your chips on anything other God, worry will choke the life right out of you. True happiness lies in trusting God for what you need. Take your mind off your shopping list, turn your thoughts to God and watch the Word bear fruit in your life. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FORGIVE AS QUICKLY AND COMPLETELY AS THE MASTER FORGAVE YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:13 TM</span><br>Quiz time. You find out that your best mate and the lurrve of your life have been getting over friendly in the tonsil-tennis department. After letting off some serious steam in their faces, they apologise, you kiss and make up and everything seems hunky dory. But where do you go from there. Do you a) accept the apology but store the incident in a cunning filing cabinet of your brain, ready to fire it back in their faces at the first whiff of a future argument; b) you accept the apology, then proceed to snog the first person with a pulse just to make a point; nobody treats you like a doormat; c) you accept the apology and attempt to start things with a clean slate. You're no doormat, but you don't hold a grudge either. 
OK, some things are easier to forgive than others. Some will even require a long healing process. Some things it will be the last thing you want to do. But when we carry a grudge with us, we carry a suitcase of resentment, stress and hurt around with us. Forgiveness helps us. It's not an excuse to be walked over; it's touching in with the heart of God. Jesus wants what's best for us. If something seems impossible, take it to Jesus first, he's in the business of healing and forgiveness.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PETER REPLIED, &quot;TELL ME TO COME TO YOU ON THE WATER.&quot;' </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:28 NIV</span><br>Now that you're all fully fledged water-walkers, dry your little pinkies with a towel and consider why we don't see more water-walking in our local swimming baths?  
1) Rubber armbands have replaced faith. We can trust a little piece of rubber wrapped around our arms to keep us afloat in the baths, but we struggle to trust the creator of the universe to keep us afloat in life. If Jesus is on the water asking you to come, will you go?
2) Water-walking is so yesterday. It was all the range in Galilee 2000 years ago, but miracles don't happen nowadays, do they? 'Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever' (Hebrews 13:8 NKJV). That means He can do just what He did then even now. So strap on those flippers, its water trudging time!
3) It's scary at the deep end. What happens if you sink? It sure is a long way down to the bottom. Jesus was still held up by the very water that was sinking Peter. Peter's problem wasn't the water, it was his doubt. Whatever step of faith we're taking, the issue isn't the water, it's our doubt. 
OK, so unless you distinctly see Jesus at your swimming baths calling you to moonwalk across the pool, best stick to the front crawl. But think about in which areas Jesus asking you to trust Him against the odds?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEN PETER GOT...OUT OF THE BOAT, WALKED ON THE WATER... TOWARD JESUS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:29 NIV</span><br>And now simple lessons in walking on water! 
1) Only walk on water with a qualified instructor. Peter said, 'Lord, if it's you, bid me to come to you on the water' and Jesus said, 'Come.' Before you take on something like water-walking, pray and be sure God's in it. 
2) Water-walking is not a team sport. Don't expect people to be jumping out of the boat with you, crying, 'last one on the waves is a wet fish'. Water-walking is a lonely calling; not everybody wants to risk the waves. In fact, some might even slate you, because they're worried that you make them look like cowardy-custards. 
3) Walking on water leaves you pretty wet! When Jesus said, 'Come,' they were in the middle of a storm. Yes, we'd all like the stars to line up spelling out 'Go for it, God says it's safe, my son'. But hey, face it, if that really happens, chances are you've been spiked by a 1960's psychedelic drug rather than hearing directly from God. 
4) Walking on water increases your chances of sinking. Nobody walks in faith without feeling like they're sinking from time to time. Peter takes his eyes off Jesus and focuses on the l mammoth waves and lo and behold, the laws of nature kick in. Lesson learned: Focus on Jesus and you won't go under.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 27:46 NIV</span><br>Ever felt left to it? Abandoned? Jesus has been there too. Nailed to a cross, public opinion turned against Him, physical, emotional and spiritual pain, history's sins slung across His shoulders; surely this couldn't be the plan, could it? Sold out by a 'friend'. Abandoned on a hill to die a slow death. And now he's crying, 'My God, why have you forsaken me?' Surely the plan has took a wrong turn somewhere, this can't be it, can it? The bleakest point in the history of humankind, God's own Son killed by the people He created. And yet the bleakest point in history also becomes the highest point of history. Even through crucifixion God's plan will be done.  From this point on, the history and future of mankind is saved by God. Abandoned: no, forsaken: no. Jesus is at the heart of the plan even when to onlookers things look very, very wrong. The  words, 'God, where are you?' teach us that: a) you can be in God's plan, yet at times feel overwhelmed and alone b) when God doesn't answer, you must stand on the Word He has given you c) there's always something bigger going on than what first meets the eye. 
Has God left you to it? Never! Has God abandoned you? No! Will God forsake you? Not on his Son's life! Stick with the plan. Stick with God.]]></introtext>

You know it all should add up, but it just seems impossible. It's as if a bunch of Maths geeks have come up with the best form of arithmetic torture since Carol Vorderman unleashed Countdown on us. But if you stick with it long enough somehow you see there's always a solution. It's the same in life. At times, we all experience problems that seem too big for our heads to deal with. Nothing takes God by surprise. Nothing is too big for God to deal with. He cracks the number conundrum every time. '&quot;For I know the plans I have for you&quot; declares the Lord, &quot;plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope and a future&quot;'. This promise is as true for you today as it was in Jeremiah's day.  
Maybe, we're facing an impossible situation at the moment; maybe we think God has just left us to it. Just like in Sudoku, there is a way out, God knows how much you can and cannot endure, and, at the right time, a way out will come along; a solution to the problem. Only, you'll leave the problem stronger and wiser for next time. There's nothing that happens to you that God can't turn around for His and your own good. God has plans to take care of you.]]></introtext>

1) Your own custom built gaff. Worried that you just become worm food when you die? Jesus told us not to worry, In God's gaff there's space a-plenty, right now he's got the architects in making sure it just how we'll love it. In John 14:1-3, He says so. 
2) Its party City. Revelation 21:2 promises it's big enough to house a party for billions to come and go. And come and go they will. The gates never close. Why shut them? Everyone is 24 hour party people with nothing to stress over, there's no bad guys here. Call off the dogs.
3) Its hanging out with the celebs time! A guest list of history makers since time began, with none other than the eternal VIP Jesus Christ Himself to hang out with; things are about to get interesting right about now. So what are you waiting for? Go get as many names on the guest list as you can. To borrow Pink's catchphrase, God is saying, 'I'm coming over, so you better get the party started!']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEREFORE...IN VIEW OF GOD'S MERCY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:1 NIV</span><br>If God is Chief of everything, what's our part in all of this? Romans 12 gives us some good ideas. Here's just a smidgeon of what it has to say: a) don't just pay lip service saying thanks to God, let your life say thanks; your working, walking, talking life b) don't let all the junk around you drag you down to its level. If God is Chief, let him bring out the best in you. The world's packed with immature attitudes, grow up in maturity with God c) if God is the boss, you're part of the team. No straying from the team talk, no sleeping on the touch line, no back-chat to your team-mates, focus on playing your own part to the best of your ability.
In fact, there's even more wisdom, it tells us to: a) love, really love, none of this plastic, fake, sentimental gush b) run from evil, cling to good c) not to quit because of hard times d) make friends with the nobodies and stop trying to be the great somebody e) discover beauty in everyone f) outsmart your enemy by doing good for them rather than trying to outdo them in the badness stakes. 
There, that's the trailer for it, now go see the movie, run a bath, put a do-not-disturb sign up; pamper yourself with a Word from the wise.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FROM HIM...ARE ALL THINGS</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 11:36 NIV</span><br>Give credit where credit is due: God is chief. 
1) Give credit due and your worry will flush down the U-bend. The Psalm songwriter didn't worry: 'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life' (Psalm 23:6). With goodness and mercy embroidered on the heels of your K-Swiss, where can you go that you should be worried about? 
2) Give credit due and you're excused from A-Level theology. The Apostle Paul is generally acknowledged as a qualified smarty pants, and even he says, 'How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out' (Romans 11:33 NKJV). Paul knew that God is Chief, some things are not worth stressing our brains over, we'll never work out why God says yes to some prayers and no to others, but we can trust He knows what He's doing.
3) Give credit due, it's all about Him, not you! Paul writes, 'From him and through him and to him are all things.' What a fancy way of saying: God is Chief! It's tempting to want to play god yourself, we all think we have our own lives sussed. We all get a bit stroppy with The Almighty from time to time, because he's not doing things our way. However, God sees the bigger picture through eternity's goggles, He's a bit more clued up than us, don't you think? Give credit due: God's chief.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>COME, SEE A MAN</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 4:29 NIV</span><br>For some people, past experiences leave them terrified of getting emotionally close to people; hopping in and out of relationships and one night stands gives them a feeling of control where they might otherwise feel powerless. Jesus met a woman at a well with her own relationship issues; five husbands down and counting, a past full of hurts, and a history of regrets, and still no clearer about herself. Unlike all the other men she'd met, Jesus addressed her real need; 'Come...meet a man who told me everything!' (TLB). Her answer wasn't another man; she'd already tried that! Her answer was meeting the man, and asking Him to fill the void in her life.
If you've got trust issues, it may take a lot of guts to put your trust in this man Jesus. But look at the story again, unlike all the other men this woman had met before, Jesus doesn't want or ask anything dodgy of her. He's not out to use, harm or manipulate her. If He was, with all the woman's background, she'd would've spotted it a mile off. Instead she recognises the Messiah. Come meet a man who is safe to get close to; come meet the Messiah.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEIR NETS BEGAN TO BREAK</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 5:6 NIV </span><br>You know when your mum just can't see it? In your head you're going to be the next Leona Lewis, and your Mum gives you that 'you've got to be joking' look, saying something like, 'that's nice dear, but what about something to fall back on, have you considered shelf-stacking?' She doesn't realise she's in the presence of a future megastar, does she? Well, it was definitely that way with Peter in Luke 5.
Peter gave Jesus the 'You've got to be joking' glance, after fishing all night without so much as a minnow. See, Jesus had told Peter, 'Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets' (Luke 5:4). Peter, after explaining he'd have more luck in the Manchester Ship Canal (okay, maybe they weren't his exact words!), went along with it. Right up until this point Peter had no way of knowing if Jesus was just the latest wannabee prophet dude trying to sound important or if He was the real deal. He just hadn't cottoned on that he was in the presence of the real Living God. Then it happened; the biggest catch of his life and he knew! Life would never be the same again. 
Have you realised yet? 24/7 you're in the presence of the Living God. Or are you waiting for something to happen? If so, what's Jesus asking you to do? What will your response be? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 17:19 NIV </span><br>Crack your Bible open, today we're looking at lessons from lepers from Luke 17:12-19. Found it...? Read it...? Right then, did you notice these three things?
1) They kept their distance. 2000 years ago, everyone stayed well clear of lepers, so when God in flesh approaches, these poor outcasts keep their distance. Ring any bells with us? When people make us feel like outcasts, we might think God would reject us as well. NO SIR! The Bible says, 'When you draw close to God He will draw close to you' (James 4:8). Get in with the best, get in with God.
2) They went on their way. We read, 'As they went, they were cleansed.' Sometimes change is speedy, but mostly it's slow. Step-by-step, the lepers walked, step by step the lepers changed. If you've been praying for a change in yourself, don't beat yourself up just because you're not where you'd like to be yet, keep on with it, you're changing step by step.  
3) They were mostly brats! Ten miracles, one set of thanks. Spoilt brat alert! This story reminds us how quickly we forget God's goodness. When God gives you your heart's desire, remember your thanks. One leper did and he became whole. Let your praise and thanks form a great big heavenly kiss on your creator; He SOOOOO deserves it!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>UNDERNEATH ARE THE EVERLASTING ARMS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 33:27 NIV</span><br>Some people wonder why God would be described as 'Father' at all. In a messed up world of absent fathers and crummy dad role models, surely it's a bad marketing mistake. Surely the last thing God would want to be compared to is a 'Father'. 
Jesus didn't just call God, 'Father'; he went a step further, describing Him as 'Abba'. No, he wasn't comparing God to a dodgy Swedish Eurovision pop combo; He was tuned into his Dad. The Aramaic word, 'abba', is a bit like when a toddler says, 'Daddy' or 'Dada' today. So, why was a grown man like Jesus baby-babbling to God? Well, perhaps if your take on dads is not a good one, maybe, the best way of looking at it is to think what would the best dad in the world be like? He'd love you no matter what, he'd want to bear-hug you tight, he'd have nothing but the best for you, he'd feel your hurt more than you feel it, he'd provide and protect you, he'd wipe away your tears, he'd get the family pics out showing everyone how proud he is of you, he'd pull out all the stops to make sure you know he loves you. God's all that and more. That's why Jesus called him, 'abba' or 'dada'. That's why you're safe in your dada's everlasting arms. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>STREAMS OF LIVING WATER WILL FLOW FROM WITHIN</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 7:38</span><br>A little boy asked his mum if he could sleep over at his friend's house. 'Why?' she asked. 'Just for fun,' he replied. 'But you slept over there last night,' she said. He thought for a minute then asked, 'Who says you can't have fun two nights in a row?' He's got a good point hasn't he! 
As your life progresses you might find yourself starting to question some of the boundaries that have been created around you. The challenge is going to be working out which of the rules you are expected to follow really are for your ultimate benefit and which are just temporary guidelines that can be removed as you get more mature - a bit like stabilisers on a bike! The problem is, you won't always be in the best position to tell the difference. That's why it's great to be a follower of Jesus. You don't have to read many pages of the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) to see that Jesus really didn't like rules very much. He lived in a world where people were weighed down and boxed in by all kinds of stupid laws. But Jesus didn't teach anyone to just stuff the rules and do whatever they wanted; He taught about living life by higher laws. Religious rules pressurise from the outside-in; His spirit-rhythms flow from the inside-out. Make sure you're in the flow today! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD WILL...TREAT YOU EXACTLY AS YOU TREAT THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 7:1 CEV</span><br>If you had to make a list of the scariest words in the world what would be on it? Chances are this word would be pretty high on the list; Rejection. That's something about being human that means we have a deep need to be accepted and appreciated. There are two ways to deal with this scary word. The first way is to change for the worse and start doing all sorts of things that you don't really feel comfortable doing just coz you think that's the way you've got to be to 'fit in' and not get the cold shoulder. The second way is to change for the better and start looking for ways that you can let other people, people who maybe spend most of their time feeling like outsiders, know that they actually are amazing creations who God has a plan and purpose for. Solomon said, 'It's wonderful to say the right thing at the right time' (Proverbs 15:23 NLT). Have you any idea how many of the people you know never hear a word of appreciation? People aren't mind-readers; when you see something good in someone, tell them. Don't wait for a sign from Heaven first! Think about practical ways you can help people feel accepted and appreciated. Paul said, 'Whenever we have the opportunity we should do good to all' (Galatians 6:10 NLT). God's blessed you to be a blessing, so don't hold back today. ]]></introtext>

The rest, your character, is hidden deep below the waterline.  Character means acting the same, no matter who's watching. It's how we react to everyday agro and hassle. It's how we handle failure and success. It's making the right choices, in the small things and the big things. Israel's famous leader Joshua challenged them: 'Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve...But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.' So today, the choice is yours!
Ever notice that some people always blame other people, or their circumstances when something goes wrong? That's a sure sign that they've got a lot of learning to do in the character department. And what do you do if that's you - if 'blame' is your middle name?! Well for a start, stop flamin' blamin'! You can no more blame your lack of character on your circumstances than you can blame the mirror for your lack of good looks! Choose to change. Every time you make a good decision you take another step forward.
Take a minute now and jot down the times when you've faced a temptation recently. Next to each, note your choice. What problem areas do you see? Write down what choice you will make next time and pray that God will help you see it through.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE HAS SENT ME TO BIND UP THE BROKENHEARTED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 61:1 NAS</span><br>Right, we're going to spend one more day on relationships. Have you ever thought that your relationships are a bit like having a bank account? Bank accounts are great, as long as you've got money in the account! When you overspend your account goes into 'overdraft'; not good news. Before you know it nasty letters are coming through the letterbox telling you that unless you put things right they will charge you more and more. Oh, and they usually let you know that they will charge you 25 quid just for sending you the letter. Cheek! 
When you abuse someone's trust, you send your 'relationship account' into overdraft! There are only two things you can do: 
1) Stop making withdrawals! Don't go expecting loads of favours like you normally do. This is time to practice the Jesus way, aka denying yourself (see Mark 8:34) For now, lean on God and start re-learning how to live life without that individual constantly being there to meet your needs. 
2) Start making deposits! Make them small and often. Your gift will return to you...pressed down, shaken together...running over' (Luke 6:38 TLB). Quietly find ways to make life easier for the person you've hurt: use kind words and thoughtful actions. These are the things that help defrost the atmosphere and make it possible to start getting along again. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I THANK MY GOD EVERY TIME I REMEMBER YOU</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 1:3 NIV</span><br>Every minute of every day, somewhere in the world someone is taking their car to the mechanic. A lot of the time, what happens when the mechanic looks at the problem is that a whole bunch of other problems get spotted too! In the same way, a relationship breakdown can bring into focus all sorts of personal issues too, like how well we do or don't communicate, or how we cope or don't with intimacy issues. If you want a healthy relationships then sooner or later you'll have to allow God to get His hands on areas of your own life that aren't the way He designed them to be. If you try to keep on driving your life forward without ever spending time being tweaked and tuned by the Holy Spirit don't be surprised when you break down. 
While we're on this sort of holy 'Top Gear' theme think about this too: every car needs oil to keep its engine running smoothly. So what's the 'oil' of relationships? Appreciation. Saying thanks, and meaning it. Do the people close to you know that you're thankful for the things they do for you? If you haven't shown your appreciation recently then it won't be long before that relationship starts overheating! Paul told his friends 'I thank my God every time I remember you', why not do the same today?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN I SEE HIM, PERHAPS HE WILL ACCEPT ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 32:20 NLT</span><br>Life doesn't come with a lifetime pain-free guarantee; and when pain comes, especially relational pain, getting life back on track involves a degree of effort and risk. If I care about you, but do something that hurts you, then I have to hope that ultimately you'll forgive me and put it behind you. To make this possible you'd have to believe that I'm truly sorry and won't do it again. This explains why healing a wounded relationship is a two-person job. Your job is to work at trusting me again and my job is to prove that I'm trustworthy. When we start rebuilding that broken bridge of trust we shorten the distance that separates us until we can be re-united. 
A classic example of this is found in the story of the brothers Jacob and Esau, in Genesis 32. Jacob had ripped off his brother, then run away. Years passed until eventually Jacob knew he had to put things right. It's fair to say that Jacob was bricking it, not knowing whether his brother would hug him or hang him! Before he actually meets his brother face to face he sends him all sorts of gifts as a way of saying sorry, to make a good impression and to show he's changed. To Jacob's relief his brother isn't bitter about the past; he's dealt with it in his heart. 
Should you do some bridge-building today?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE HEARD YOUR PRAYER AND SEEN YOUR TEARS; I WILL HEAL YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 KINGS 20:5 NIV</span><br>Lots of animals when they're hurt and bleeding will lick their wounds. In a funny kind of way we can do the same. We get all introverted and focus over and over again one the pain we feel. Well it might work for dogs and cats but not for you and me! Healing involves three things that you can't do on your own: 
1) Talking. Find a trustworthy person and get the pain out in words. It will help you get over the anger and the blame and the confusion 
2) Sharing. A problem shared is a problem halved, right? When nobody knows how you feel the hurt is made worse by loneliness and isolation. Don't let that happen 
3) Acceptance. If the person who hurt you apologises and asks for forgiveness don't reject it - accept it! Yes, maybe you do want them to feel as bad as you do but that just brings twice as much hurt into a world that's got too much already. 
Many years ago a broken King cried out to God from the bottom of his heart. God replied graciously saying, 'I have heard your prayers and seen your tears; I will heal you,' That's a word for you too today, if you dare to believe that the God who healed back then is still in the healing business today. Do you? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE HEALS THE BROKENHEARTED AND BINDS UP THEIR WOUNDS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 147:3 NIV</span><br>It happens to people every day. Maybe it's happening to you right now? Not much hurts like broken promises and shattered trust. But you know, God is the Healer and that extends to relationships. Here's three things about how that healing works:
1) Healing of the heart is a process, not an event. Give it time. All the apologies in the world (and apologies are good; when they're for real) can't heal anyone overnight. Nobody can set up a schedule for emotional healing; 'OK, by next Thursday at 2 o'clock everything will be sorted.' Nope. In fact trying to rush it will only make it worse. 
2) Not normal is normal, for now! Ever notice how if part of your body is bruised or sore you automatically protect it from more knocks and bumps? Right. It's the same when you're bruised deep inside. Oh yeah, the one who caused the pain may be doing business as usual but for the wounded, life feels way too vulnerable right now. A hurting person needs handling with extra care - like they have a label on saying 'FRAGILE - Handle With Care'. 
3) Remember, healing will come, in time. God said, 'There is a time to cry and a time to laugh. There is a time to be sad and a time to dance. (Ecclesiastes 3:4 NCV). So if it's you that's hurting, or someone you love, trust that God is the Healer. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD LOVES A CHEERFUL GIVER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:7 NIV</span><br>OK, let's start with a chunky chunk of Bible today: 'The person who plants a little will have a small harvest, but the person who plants a lot will have a big harvest. Each of you should give as you have decided in your heart to give. You should not be sad when you give, and you should not give because you feel forced to give. God loves the person who gives happily... God can give you more blessings than you need. Then you will always have plenty of everything - enough to give to every good work' (2 Corinthians 9:6-8 NCV). 
Are you a cheerful giver or a fearful giver? You're probably not a greedy person. You might really want to help God's work. But do you usually look after yourself first? Why not? Most people do! Well imagine a farmer, who, for fear of getting hungry, eats his seed for breakfast and leaves nothing to plant in his fields. It's daft, right?! So don't scoff the seed that God wants to be sown for your future harvest. 
When you make giving your first priority, you don't have to fear. Jesus said, 'Put God's work first and do what he wants. Then the other things will be yours as well' (Matthew 6:33 CEV). When you get a God's-eye view on your cash the thing to fear isn't giving away too much, it's planting too little!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD CHOSE THINGS THE WORLD CONSIDERS FOOLISH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 1:27 NLT</span><br>Remembering his time working at a summer camp, Tony Campolo says, 'Teenage boys have a tendency to pick on some unfortunate kid. That summer it was 13-year-old Billy, a kid who couldn't walk or talk right. When the kids from his cabin were assigned to lead devotions, they voted Billy in as the speaker. It didn't seem to bother him. He dragged himself up to the pulpit amid sneers and snickers and it took him a long time to stammer, &quot;Je-sus loves...me... and...I...love Je-sus.&quot; There was stunned silence, and when I looked around there were boys with tears streaming down their cheeks. We'd done many things to try to reach these boys but nothing had worked. It wasn't until a special needs kid declared his love for Christ that everything changed. I travel a lot and it's surprising how often I meet people who say, &quot;You probably don't remember me. I became a Christian at a camp where you worked and do you know what the turning point was for me?&quot; I never have to ask. I always know I'm going to hear, &quot;Billy!&quot;'
The Bible says, 'God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise.' So when you find yourself focusing on what you can't do, remember that, do what you can and let God do the rest! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN THE SHADOW OF HIS HAND HE HID ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 49:2 NIV</span><br>After visiting the Balkan region of South-eastern Europe, reporter James Creelman wrote, 'I learned that the world's supply of rose oil comes from the Balkan Mountains. The thing that interested me was that the roses had to be gathered during the darkest hours. Initially this seemed to be a relic of superstition. But as I investigated I learned that 40% of the fragrance disappears in the light of day.' Do you want to make a difference in the world? Well, God wants your life to be really smelly (check out 2 Corinthians 2:14-16) and you'll need to let God work with you in the shadows before you come into the spotlight.
Before the prophet Elijah called down fire from heaven in front of the evil pagan priests on Mount Carmel, God told him to go and hide himself at a brook known as Cherith (1 Kings 17). The country was in a mess and people were dying but Elijah needed to sit tight in this craggy Nowhereville until God said the time was right for him to go and confront the King.  
Stories like this make us think differently about being in the shadow, don't they? Like Elijah you need to learn to embrace the shadows, enjoy the sidelines, to discover God and grow in them, then stride out confidently with something to say that's worth listening to!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS TO PROTECT YOU WHEREVER YOU GO</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 91:11 CEV</span><br>When Steve Anderson's mother-in-law developed cancer, his wife flew out to see her. Steve really wanted to go too, but they couldn't afford two tickets. Steve prayed and amazingly a local businessman called Joe offered him a seat in a two-seater airplane. On the journey they encountered thick fog and needed to get in contact with the air-traffic controller who recommended they turn back. But fuel was low, so Steve prayed again. A voice came back through the radio, 'Come in on emergency landing.' Then as they descended the radio voiced screamed, 'Pull it up! Pull it up!&quot;' Through a break in the fog they saw that instead of approaching the airport they were over a busy highway and had narrowly missed an overpass! The voice continued, 'Listen to me and I'll get you down,' and calmly issued instructions until they landed. Safely on the ground Joe picked up the radio and told the tower, 'We'd never have made it without you. Thanks, you saved our lives.' The controller replied, 'What're you talking about? We lost contact with you right after we told you to turn back!' So, if the controller didn't guide them in, who did? The Psalmist wrote, 'God will command his angels to protect you wherever you go' (Psalm 91:11 CEV). Steve Anderson says, 'I believe God sent an angel to bring us in safely.' And He'll do the same for you! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHERE CAN I RUN FROM YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 139:5 NCV</span><br>A story is told of a London bus driver was had to drive people to the massive mission events at Wembley Stadium where evangelist Billy Graham would be preaching. When one of them invited him in to listen he said 'No thanks'. The following year he moved to New York and guess what, Billy was preaching at Madison Square Garden this time and the bus driver was once again doing the shuttle run. As he helped people off the bus, a lady asked if he'd like to join them. Once more he politely declined. Later, the bus driver married an Australian lady and eventually ended up working in Sydney where, once again he was assigned to drive people to a stadium where Billy was preaching. This time when he was invited he figured there was no escape, so he gave in. Looking back he says, 'No matter where I went I was confronted with Billy Graham, so I went to hear him and committed my life to Christ. It was the best decision I ever made.'
David's great Psalm says, 'Where can I go to get away from your Spirit? Where can I run from you?' (Psalm 139:7 NCV). Isn't God amazing? He'll follow you round the world to give you another chance to find your life in Him. How many chances has He already given you? Say yes to him today. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DRAW NEAR TO GOD AND HE WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 4:8 NKJV</span><br>A bulldog and a poodle were arguing one day. The bulldog was making fun of the poodle, calling her a weak little runt who couldn't do anything. The bulldog said, 'I challenge you to a contest. Let's see who can open the back door of their house the fastest and get inside.' The bulldog was thinking he would turn the door handle with his powerful jaws, while the poodle was too small to even reach the handle of his back door. To the bulldog's surprise the poodle said, 'OK, I accept the challenge.' 
1,2,3... GO! The bulldog ran to the back door of his house and jumped up to the handle. He got his teeth and paws around it and tried to turn it but he couldn't get enough grip. Finally he quit in frustration. Meanwhile the poodle had just been watching. Then she did what she'd been doing every day of her life. She went up to the door and scratched on it a couple of times, then waited. Within a few seconds her master opened the door and picked her up in his arms, cuddled her and carried her inside. 
The difference was in the relationship. Some of us are bulldog Christians. It's all grunting, growling and trying to be the first. Give it up! All God asks us to do is, 'Draw near to Me and I will draw near to you.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SHE HAS SHOWN ME MUCH LOVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 7:47 NLT</span><br>Jesus was never shocked. In fact, people found Him shocking; even scandalous. Luke writes, 'One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home...a certain immoral woman...heard he was...there [and]...brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. Then she knelt...at his feet, weeping... kissing his feet and putting perfume on them' (Luke 7:36-38 NLT). Some people, who have been hurt by religion can't stand being in the same room as religious people. Some people are so religious they don't know how to relate to people still lost in their sins. Jesus was neither. He accepted the invitation to eat with the religious guy, the Pharisee. At the same time though He gave grace to the sinner. Can you do the same?
Jesus said, 'Her sins; and they are many; have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love.'
Clock these 3 points: 1) Keeping in mind what Jesus saved you from will keep you passionate in your love and your giving 2) Other people may know what you've done but Jesus knows what you can become 3) Don't be afraid of showing your emotions. That's not just a personality thing, we all know some people are more emotional than others. No, this is about not letting anything stop you showing Jesus know how much you love Him. Show Him today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET US NOT GIVE UP MEETING TOGETHER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 10:25 NIV</span><br>Geese. They flap around with their long bandy necks, honking (ie making a loud noise; not a smell!) What could we ever learn from a goose? Well chew on this: Every autumn geese fly south to where the climate is warmer. But they don't just set off in a random flappage of feathers, they fly together in a 'V' formation. Geese know that to complete the long trip, they have to fly united. Air waves created each time a bird flaps its wings provide uplift for the one behind, conserving its energy and enabling it to double its flying range. A goose flying solo could never complete the trip but in formation the youngest, the oldest and even the weakest get there. In other words, they do as a team what they could never do alone.
When the Bible says, 'Let us not give up meeting together... but let us encourage one another,' it's saying, 'Stay in formation! Enjoy the uplift!' Christians aren't meant to fly solo, whatever their calling, gifting or maturity. We're all part of Team Jesus, created to fly as a unit with other believers. Sometimes a goose will go off alone and find itself adrift. Before long though its wings become heavy from exhaustion and it loses altitude. There's only one thing it can do; get back with the group. How about you? Are you flying in formation today?]]></introtext>

It's a natural thing. Your muscles, blood and heart need a gentle push to get em' going. A bit like life hey? You can warm up daily by practising what's important to you. It's during these warm ups that you prepare to face life's challenges. If you commit yaself to practice you will find that:
1) Life can always be improved: A famous write once said: 'understand that almost anything that has been done in a particular way for a given amount if time, can be done better.' Every single performance can be improved!!
2) Getting better at what you do is risky: Even getting out of bed has some sort of risk attached...so find a safe place to grow and test what is right and wrong for you!!
3) Start with the small things: When you 1st start to improve you'll get better slowly but you will get better. Remember the difference between a Gold 100m winner and a silver is hundredths of a second but there is still room to get better...slowly!!
4) There's a price to pay to reach the next level: You heard the saying &quot;practice makes perfect&quot;...well its true!! The more you practise, rehearse and go over and over til its right, the better you will be. So keep practising!!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 4:15 NIV</span><br>Have you got any amazing tracks on you mp3 player? Do you listen to them and think 'oh my days that band is amazing'! Well they probably didn't start out that way. In the bible it says that when David played his harp for his King Saul that, &quot;relief would come to Saul&quot; It hints at 2 things - the power of praise and the power of practice. David didn't suddenly wake up one morning and realise 'Oh my gosh, I am great on the Harp!' He had to practice when he was chiilin' on the hills with the sheep. When it comes to practice there are 2 tough things we face. 1). Having the desire to do it! 2) Having the desire to stick at it! Paul tells Timothy &quot;...don't be diverted, just keep at it&quot;... (1 Timothy 4:15 The Message) There's no way to get better at anything without being disciplined and sticking with it. It's more than talent, it's choice! And once the choice is it becomes a habit. Then two things will become obvious: 1) There'll be a clear difference between the one who practices and the one who slacks off. 2) You'll form a winning spirit. The harder the work gets, the less you'll want to give in. Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France 7 times and said &quot;success comes from training harder and digging deeper than others&quot;. ]]></introtext>

When David knocked out Goliath he didn't have a special laser gun, but he had the winners attitude! It says in the bible he &quot;ran quickly toward the battle line to meet Goliath&quot; (1 Samuel 17:48 NIV). King Saul was hiding but David was having none of it and ran to meet the challenge! David had amazing faith, not in himself but in &quot;him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask, dream or imagine, according to his power that is at work in us&quot; (Ephesians 3:20 NIV). 
A boffin called Martin Seligman, a professor, did some research on a sales company and found that staff with a positive sales attitude sold twice as much as those who didn't... they're running to meet the challenge!! Boffins have also found that if you're self confident then you'll generally achieve more stuff than if you're intelligent. You see the only thing that stops us achieving great stuff is our lack of believing in ourselves!! The more we believe in ourselves the more we get done. If you keep believing you may even end up doing what you first thought was impossible!! &quot;With God all things are possible&quot; (Matthew 19:26) Remember, great results start with great expectations!!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let God transform you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12:2 GNT</span><br>Change only happens when you:
1) Decide to change! A newspaper asked people to answer the question: 'What's wrong with the world' and someone wrote back &quot;I am&quot;!! Good answer! It's true. If God kicked every person in the butt who was responsible for messing up the world nobody would be able to sit down for a week!! 
2) Change the way you think! The Bible says &quot;let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think&quot; (Romans 12:2 NLT) The way you think affects the way you feel and the way you feel affects the way you act. When you're thinking God thoughts you'll act the way he wants you to. Here's a tip - get into the bible...that's the best way to change your thinking!
3) Take a small step everyday! We think change is gonna happen overnight... it won't! It happens slowly. For change to work start with small things but do them everyday. And don't get discouraged when you mess up. We all stumble about like Bambi when we're trying to change. Read this, &quot;there has never been a doubt in my mind that God who started this great work in you (change) would keep at it and bring to a flourishing (fancy word) finish on the very day Jesus appears&quot; (Philippians 1:6 The Message). And don't forget, God is there to help you. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He...gave gifts...to equip God's people...and build up...the church.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:8-12 NLT</span><br>Different people have different gifts or talents, your gift or talent will be totally different from your mates. You gifts and talents are given to you ultimately to serve God with. In Ephesians 4 (The Message) it talks about different gifts by saying...&quot;he handed out gifts from above and below, filled heaven with his gifts, filled earth with his gifts. He handed out gifts of an apostle, prophet, evangelist and pastor-teacher to train Christians in skilled servant work...till we are moving rhythmically and easily with each other&quot;. So all of us have a unique set of talents to help us all get along. What we have to figure out is...what's my gift? Until that question is answered you can feel a bit out of place, a bit like a striker playing in defence. You can get by - but never be truly excellent. 
Some people are called to be leaders....that may be you? If it is then you're gifted in helping people succeed. Why do people need to be helped like this? So they can serve God better. Why is serving God so important? To help the church be stronger to impact the world more positively. That's why it's so important to get what your gift is. You'll enjoy your life so much more once you figure out &quot;What's my gift&quot;? Make sure you pray about it today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Friends come and friends go but a true friend sticks by you like family,</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 18:24 </span><br>You've heard the saying &quot;you know who you mates are&quot; It's used when a friendship is being tested right! Having a good mate in you life is a bit like riding a bus... you have to move over and let them sit with you for the journey, including all the baggage that comes with them. When you let them do that you're saying &quot;you matter to me&quot;.
The 2 things we look for in mates are 1) they won't bail out when the going gets tough. 2) whatever stupid stuff you do won't change them being mates and standing by you. Solomon was an important dude in the Bible and he wrote &quot;friends come and friends go but a true friend sticks by you like family&quot; Having one quality mate is better than having loads of not so good mates! Don't be too quick to write someone off coz they made a mistake or messed up with you. If your bike had a flat you wouldn't dump it just for that would you? Nah, you'd fix it. In a similar way, work on fixing your friendships. Yeah they're gonna be up and down but your quality mates can be relied on in the tough times, when you need a lift or feeling down they are there to pick you up. Life ain't built on what you get, its built on friendships, so keep working at yours today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let us not judge.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 14:13 NKJV</span><br>A word that never fits very well with grace is control. People that control are often caught in being too religious and are not very up on the grace thang coz they think they know it all!! Ring any bells with you? How much happier would you be if you didn't try to control stuff, people, situations and all that? A guy called Dennis Leonard wrote 'Give your loved ones the dignity of making their own mistakes and learning from them. If you're always getting into someone else's business, you're not only going to burn out, you're hindering God from working in their lives...They belong to Him not you!'
In the Bible there were proper arguments about what you could and couldn't eat and Paul had loads to say about it, &quot;Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don't. And those who don't eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. (Rom 14: 3 NLT). You may not feel its right to do something but you can't push what you feel on other people, just coz you feel that way! Is what you want to say gonna be helpful or just get their back up? The bible says &quot;let's agree to use all our energy in getting along with each other. Help others with encouraging words' (Rom 14:19 TM) That's top advice...try it out!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We do not...compare ourselves.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;> 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV</span><br>It is so easy to compare ourselves to our mates and people around us. If someone has the latest games console, the freshest kicks, a new ride and the best threads we compare ourselves against them don't we? Life becomes all about &quot;how do we match up&quot; or even &quot;how much better or more stuff have we got than them&quot;. The Bible says that we shouldn't compare ourselves, each of us is a total individual, a one off. Comparing only leads us to compete and criticise and &quot;want what they've got&quot;. It shows that a person is insecure and that there's not much grace about. 
Grace allows you to let people be themselves without comparing. The Apostle Paul says &quot;who are we to judge&quot;. He learnt that judging is God's job to do - not ours!
A famous writer called Gladys Hunt wrote: 'Acceptance means you're valuable just as you are...You aren't forced into someone else's idea...You can talk about how you feel...and why...and someone really cares...you can try out ideas without being shot down... You feel safe. No one will judge you ...even though they don't agree with you. It doesn't mean you'll never be corrected...it simply means it's safe to be you.' Grace is all over it what she wrote!! Wouldn't you love to be like that? You will be if you make a choice to grow in grace!!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We walk by faith, not by sight.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 5:7 </span><br>3 dudes in the Bible were thrown into a fire for not worshipping who they were told to... A bit harsh! Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were literally dumped from the frying pan into the fire...did they have a hope? They did with God coz God is 'the MAN' when it comes to the impossible! Just think how impressive God is...  look at the stars... the creation that has gone into that blows your mind! God saved the three young dudes from the flames coz they believed and had faith in God. Even the King himself admitted 'Blessed be...God... who...delivered His servants who...trust in Him...there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way' (Daniel 3:28 - 29).
In the Bible God says &quot;stick all your worries on me, coz I care for you&quot;...everything we go through, God is there. Praying about your situation will change it if you have the faith to believe that God is interested and he will answer. When you look back you will see that you couldn't have come up with a better answer anyway. So try it today, take an Indiana Jones style 'step of faith'. Do you remember that scene in the film? What happened? The path suddenly appeared beneath him. So will you step out today and &quot;walk by faith, not by sight&quot;? Make a decision now that you'll go for it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>My people have...forsaken...the...living water, and...dug ...broken cisterns.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 2:13 NIV</span><br>It's easy to feel good about life when it's all going to plan... but we all know that don't always happen, right? The Bible talks about &quot;being happy at anytime in everything'...coz basically if you wait about for your life to happen the way you want it to, you will be hangin' about for ages! A clever geezer once said: &quot;don't mess up what you have by wanting what you don't have&quot;. So remember these 3 things:
1). Enjoy what God's already given you...try not to be greedy...be satisfied where you're at...its good to have goals and dreams but learn to enjoy the journey on the way to those dreams!!
2). Don't be scared!! Fear wants you to run from something that's not actually chasing you...being scared can steal your peace...will have you thinking &quot;what if&quot; and will stop you trusting in God...Psalm 56:4 says &quot;in God I trust, I will not be scared&quot;....when you really get that in your heart you can fully chill with God.
3) Don't look in the wrong places!! That verse at the top is basically saying that God's people were seriously on the wrong track...going the wrong way...relying on the wrong things...if we rely on ourselves we are doing just the same as them and will end up on the wrong track. Let's take up a dare today and rely on Jesus!!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Peter 3:18  NIV</span><br>Dale Evans was married to a famous Hollywood film star. She was a great lady who loved Jesus with all her heart. Here's one of her prayers: 
'Lord, you know that I'm growing older. Keep me from the fatal habit of thinking I must say something on every subject and on every occasion. Deliver me from the need to try and straighten out everybody's affairs. Keep my mind free from endless details; give me wings to get to the point. I ask for grace to listen to the tales of others' pains; but seal my lips when it comes to my own aches and pains. I ask not for improved memory, but for a growing humility, especially when my memory seems to clash with the memory of others. Teach me that occasionally I may be mistaken. Keep me reasonably sweet. I don't necessarily want to be a saint; some of them are so hard to live with. Make me thoughtful but not moody, helpful but not bossy. Give me, I pray, the ability to see blessings in unexpected trials and goodness in less-than-perfect people. And give me the grace to tell them so, in Christ's name, amen.'
It's obvious that Dale's relationship with Jesus was really personal and really honest. How about you? Are your prayers just phrases you've picked up from here and there or are they from the bottom of your heart?  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Everything is permissible for me - but</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 6:12 NIV</span><br>Let your body know who's in charge. Try saying 'NO' to yourself everyday. If you do, you'll be able to do it when it matters. Paul writes, 'I am allowed to do all things, but not all things are good for me to do. I am allowed to do all things, but I will not let anything make me its slave.' Paul measures what he does by these words. Is it good for me? Could it control me?
Do you tell yourself, 'I need to change, but I'll do it tomorrow'! You can eat chocolate cake every night at bedtime if you want but it's not good for you, especially if you want to look buff! You can do whatever you want with your time, spend your dosh how you want, but don't start complaining when you're left with nothing. You can fill your head with all kinds of rubbish but remember that filling your head the rubbish will mash up your head in no time leaving you with no respect for yourself or anyone else. 
If you want to stop your bad habits and start some good ones, the only person who can do that is, YOU. Who you are is made up of what you choose everyday. Day by day, what you think, what you choose and what you do, is who you become.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>His word is in my heart like a fire.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 20:9 NIV</span><br>If you've ever built a fire you'll know it eventually goes out if you don't keep topping it up. There are two kinds of peeps you will meet in life: The fire-fuellers and the fire-quenchers.The fire-fuellers help you and push you to be better. The fire-quenchers will try stopping you and holding you back. How can you tell the difference? People who quench your fire usually say things like: 'you can't do that... we tried before but it didn't work... don't try change things when there's no need... you don't have the talent', and stuff like that. If you've heard this before from other people around you, pray for them, love them, but don't let them affect you. These people always see what's wrong rather than what's right. They stop you from trying to be the best by putting out your fire. Sometimes they do this on purpose and other times they don't know that they're doing it. 
Spend more time with fire-fuellers because they don't look at you and see you the way you are, but see what you can be. They want you to burn hotter and brighter! 
There's about 200 million Christians in the Chinese church today. One of the guys who helped fuel the fire was a dude called Hudson Taylor. He said, 'The sun has never risen in China in 40 years, without me on my knees in prayer.' That's passion!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I must be about my Father's business.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 2:49</span><br>Look at the life of Jesus. When he was 12 He told His folks, 'I had to be in my Father's house.' Later he told His disciples, 'We must do the work of the one who sent me here' (John 9:4).  Jesus knew what He was sent here to do and He didn't let anything or anybody get in his way!!! When you plan your life around your God-given talent maybe you'll get laughed at by people but they don't know who you really are and what's burning inside you!!! Ask yourself, 'Would I rather live with the pain of taking a chance, or the pain of wishing I'd done something but now it's too late?' Hmmmmmm...?'
Leader dude, Dr John Maxwell describes a decision to change that he made, 'I noticed that my talents would be used better if my passion was the same as my plans. I was wasting time doing things I didn't really want to do and doing things I didn't really have the talent to do. It changed my life! My problems and all the stuff that was in my way didn't just go away though, but it gave me the courage to face them with greater energy and excitement.' If your plans are not side by side with your passion, you best start planning around your passions - make some changes today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 1:6 NIV</span><br>There are 2 kinds of life you need to avoid:
1) Life with a low flame - Don't become like Eddie who's Nana liked opera. On Eddie's eighth birthday she took him to the Opera which was sung in German. The very next day he wrote a note to his Nana: 'Dear Nana, thank you for the birthday present. It's what I always wanted, but not very much. Love from Eddie.' You have to admire the honesty! There's an old saying: 'Find something you love doing so much that you would do it for nothing and when you learn to do it really well, people will actually like pay you to do it.
2) Life with no flame - Some people say they've had enough. The truth is that most of them never had the right kinda energy in the first place. Author dude Norman Cousins said, 'Death isn't the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we're still alive.' So if you're not careful you could end up like the dude whose grave stone said, 'Died at 30, Buried at 60.' Don't let that happen to you. When you find your God-given talent, you find your passion. Will you have to keep finding the energy? Yes you will, quite often! But it will rev you up and carry you to where you want to be.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[My] life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned me.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 20:24 TLB</span><br>Passion, isn't just the dodgy stuff people get carried away with in steamy moments of lurrrve! Actually, no, passion is something we can all do with a bit of. Passion energises you! Passion brings results. Passion keeps you from quitting. Passion is infectious. Without passion, Alex Ferguson would have drawn his pension long before Cristiano Ronaldo was a twinkling in his Mum's eye. Without passion Winston Churchill would have bottled it long before D-Day. Without passion we lose our way, and end up dawdling through life aimlessly. So what are you passionate about? Do you hate it when somebody gets bullied? Maybe God is giving you a passion for justice. Do you love to get things done to the best of your ability? Maybe God is giving you passion for making lasting changes? Do you have a passion for pop star Rhianna? Maybe God is telling you to go take a cold shower! You see, the thing is we need to channel our passions into the right things. It's so easy to use our passions for ourselves, but is that what God would want? The early disciples could've used their new found celebrity to queue hop at The Ivy, or to bag themselves a place on 'I'm an apostle get me out of here!!', but instead they knew the best place for their passion was  making JC known. What about you? Where's your passion at?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Pulling down...strong holds; Casting down imaginations... bringing into captivity every thought.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 10:4-5</span><br>Paul writes: 'Pulling down...strong holds; Casting down imaginations... bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.' It all sounds a bit A-level theology, but all he's saying, is 'get a grip'. Pulling down strongholds means getting a grip on the junk in your life before it gets a grip on you. Do you need to sort some attitudes out? Do it, take control before its taken control of you. Casting down imaginations means don't let your mind run away with itself, making up a load of tosh about God not caring and all that, of course He cares, get back to the truth of it, stop believing your own fiction. Bringing into captivity every thought means get a fishing line on those wild leaping thoughts that do you no good. If your thoughts say 'I'm useless', kick them into touch with God's word, He says 'You're precious'.  
The mind is a tricky old thing, you'd think it was on our side, but if we don't take control of it, it can work against you, making up lies. Here's the good news, it's your mind, you tell it what to think about and what not. You wouldn't let your own foot kick you in your own groin, so don't let your mind kick itself in the head. So there you are, now you understand A-level theology, smarty pants.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Teach...your children and...their children after them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 4:9 NIV</span><br>It might scare the nappy off you now to think about having a kid, but one day you might find yourself having your very own sproglet The thing about kids is that they copy everything you do, its how they learn. Try this on for size, imagine having somebody following you around everywhere you go, copying every single thing you do. How embarrasing could it be! You're sat at dear old Auntie Ethel's for a nice slice of Kipling, when your little mini-me lets out a string of verbal abuse. Well you can't blame him, he's only repeating what he's heard you say with your mates. Or imagine, being with your best friend, and mini-me tells them what you really think of them, well he's only copying what you've said when you've stuck the knife in behind their back. Every parent knows that if you want your little one to have good manners, you have to model good manners to them. If you want your bundle of joy to being a kind person, you have to show them how to be kind. Could there be a bit of wisdom in there for us too? If we want to be better people, we need to copy our heavenly parent. If we want to be more like Jesus, we need to find out what sets his heart ticking, and start practising a bit of the same.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He guides me along right paths.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 23:3 NLT</span><br>Do the right thing. It's not easy, but do the right thing. Downloading that new album illegally, that's the easy thing, but it aint the right thing. Copying your mate's homework on the bus, that's the easy thing, but it aint the right thing. If you're asking whether something is a safe thing to do? Or whether it's the popular thing to do, perhaps you should be rephrasing it into, 'Is it the RIGHT thing to do?'. But how can you tell if it's right when everybody else seems to be doing it. 1) Pray about it. If you aint got peace about something, that might be a good indicator to think again. 2) Check the word. A good Youth Bible should point you in the right direction over all life's important stuff 3) Get good advice. Don't just talk to someone who doesn't know right from wrong, ask a sound, wise Christian about it, perhaps they might have struggled with the same thing at some point. The choices you make shape how you'll live your life. Saying you're a Christian and living like a caveman don't match up, its like saying you're a car just because you sleep in a garage! If you want to walk with The Lord, you've got to let him guide you, that might sometimes mean making the unpopular choice in life, hey! Its not always easy doing the right thing.  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The best...I can do is escape to Philistine country.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 27:1 TM</span><br>The 'sack it' mentality is something to watch out for. You know what I mean, Church seems boring, all your other mates are out drinking and sleeping around, your heart thinks, 'sack it' before you know it your brain's pickled with half a vat of bad cider. Or, its just you and the whole world wide web alone in a room, you tell yourself, 'sack it - what harm can it do?', so you click on that site you know you shouldn't. Or even, that moment you know you should walk away from an argument, but the red mist descends, the knuckles harden, every muscle screams, 'sack it', and you just let rip. David had his 'sack it' moments. On the run from Saul in 1 Samuel 27, he tells himself sooner or later he's dead meat, 'The best...I can do is escape to Philistine country.' For anyone who doesn't know, Philistine country was David's old battleground, and the last place he should be heading. As soon as we say, 'sack it', we head for the last place we should be going. It's destination trouble all the way. And for a while it feels good. Beware of anything that gives you an instant fix, junk food, drugs, sin, they all fill a hole temporarily, but in the long run they'll mess you up. So best sack off the 'sack it' mentality. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 1:21 </span><br>Sometimes, we're a burger short of a happy meal. In our own heads we think that by being famous all our problems in life would disappear. We think that by winning the Lotto we will have happiness on our plates forever. We think that by being The Godfather people will have heaps of respect for us. Listen up, how many famous people screw their lives up for the sake of their face in the papers? How many lives does being a millionaire buy you? How much respect do you get when you're six feet under because you've took a bullet for the sake of being number one? That's not living, it's faking. Paul sussed onto a win win situation. If he was living for Christ, he'd win, because Christ is all there is worth living for. If he died, he'd win, because he'd gain more of Christ, he'd get the full fill of Him in Heaven. That kind of thinking shifts things into perspective. When you're not honing in on the fortune or fame, but instead got all your braincells pulsing on the saviour, you've found the secret to satisfaction.  What can scare you once you've realised that by living you're with Jesus, and by dying you're with Jesus. Now isn't that just like all your numbers have come up at once, or in other words, 'For me, to live is Christ. And to die is gain'.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God...shaped each person in turn.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 33:13-15 TM</span><br>Paul has it sorted when he says, 'Each one of you is a separate and necessary part' (1 Corinthians 12:27 TLB). He knows that being different isn't a bad thing. If the church was full of carbon copies of each other, how boring would that be?! Everyone likes a good centre forward, but if a team was full of Wayne Rooneys it'd maybe score some amazing goals up front but it'd let plenty in at the back too. Its the same in Church, some of us will like to be up at the front, some of us might like to  do things quietly in the background, well that's fine as well. The Bible says, 'God shaped each person in turn,' which means you've got your bit to play. A bus is good for carrying lots of people at the same time but you wouldn't expect it to win formula one. Likewise, a  McLaren F1 is good for winning races, but it couldn't take you and you're whole school to  Blackpool for the day. Know what you're designed for, and the rest will follow. The Word says, 'Be content with who you are' (1 Peter 5:6 TM). Stop trying to be an F1 if you're naturally a bus. There's no geek or glam with God - it's all about giving yourself permission to be the person God made you to be!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He fashions...hearts individually.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 33:15 NKJV</span><br>Ever wish you were better at footie? Ever wished you were more confident? Better at drawing or handy with a computer? Well don't be too hard on yourself, maybe you're just not created to be that type of person. Maybe, there's some special assignment in life that only you can do. Maybe, the world won't be the same unless you get a particular job done. You see, God 'personally formed and made' you (Isaiah 43:7 TM). You're the only 'you' He created, so if you fail to be who you are His kingdom won't benefit from your unique contribution. The question is: Who are you? Before you answer it, ask yourself this: 'What am I good at?' Are there certain jobs that come easily to you and you wonder why others can't do them? If so, that says something about your particular strengths and your God-given assignment in life. God said of Bezalel the builder, 'I have filled him with... wisdom...He is a master craftsman, expert in working with gold, silver, and bronze. He is skilled in engraving...mounting gemstones...carving wood' (Exodus 31:3-5 NLT). Bez might have had two left feet at footy, but he had a grip on what he was good at. Once you've got a grip on what you can do and what you can't, go for it! 'Fix your eyes on what lies before you...Don't get sidetracked' (Proverbs 4:25-27 NLT). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Watch how I do it...learn to live.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 11:29-30 TM</span><br>You can study until your brain's turned blue, you can work a 48 hour day, you can even try to put the world to rights in your own dinner hour, but if you're not spending time with God, what's it all about? What's it all for? It's good to try your best, but if you're overly focused on winning, you're going to end up fried like bacon. Surely, there's more to life than just results, Jesus said, 'Are you tired? Worn out?...Come to me...recover your life. I'll show you how...work with me - watch how I do it...learn to live freely and lightly.' Sounds good, doesn't it but it calls for detoxing your thinking and reprogramming it. If your head's frazzled, ask yourself &quot;What are my priorities here?&quot; What's the point of elbowing your way to the top, if its at the expense of your mates, time, church and family? Remember, you're a human being not human doing. Sometimes you just need to be, rather than do. If you're just trying to impress with success, you're missing the whole point. Life is so much more than gaining and getting. Jesus could have rubbed people's noses in it, how so much better he was at miracles and stories than everybody else. But he wasn't interested in fame, he was too into what mattered to fall for that nonsense. Sometimes we need to relearn how to really live.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 24:43 NKJV</span><br>We don't want our stuff nicked, so we double lock our houses, we insure our phones, we hold onto our purses for dear life - but what about our hearts, don't we need to guard them as well? Three things to look out for: 1) Careful when you're cream-crackered. Esau wasn't with it, in fact he was so knackered his marbles had left him, all for the sake of a bit of supper. He made a very stupid decision that haunted him for a long time. Read it in Genesis 25:19-34 and don't say things you don't mean just because you've got a rumbling tum and you're in a bit of a mood. 2) Careful you don't get carried away. King Herod was a bit of a loose cannon. Seduced by a dancing girl, he shot his mouth off saying, 'Whatever you ask me, I will give you' (Mark 6:23 NKJV). She asked for the head of John the Baptist. A moment of excitement cost him dearly. Beware of moments of pleasure that will cost you everything. 3) Careful of lack of courage. Peter messed up big time, when he lost his bottle. He swore blind he'd never even met his best mate: Jesus. A weak moment can make you say things you don't mean. Esau being cream-crackered, Herod being a loose cannon, Peter being a coward. If only they'd double locked their hearts at the right moment. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 1:3</span><br>If The Bible bangs on about anything, its pretty much that God never lets us down when we need him. That doesn't mean he expects us to be divas doing nothing for ourselves. Quite the opposite, He wants us to pull our weight, step by step, walking by faith. It can take a lot of bottle at times, to keep on trudging and keep on trusting, especially when we just don't get where God's at with things. Job wasn't getting where God was at until 41 chapters into his own book. He'd been through the grind major style. Bankrupt, bereaved, and battered, Job treads through his darkest days believing, 'When I'm tired, I shall come forth as gold' (Job 23:10). Meaning that he was hanging onto his faith until it shined like top bling. Notice: a) it takes fire to produce gold. b) only the refiner knows the degree of heat and amount of time required c) to rush the process is to produce something of lesser value. 
Yes Job had his darker moments, when he questioned God's fairness, or even doubted if there was a God or anything out there, but if we're to take anything out of this poor man's mess, its that even in the worst of life, its worth trusting and trudging until the end. Job did, and his life was put back together through faith.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We...are being transformed into his likeness.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV</span><br>Anyone who's ever thrown a sicky from school (tut tut) is bound to have seen the daytime TV classic, 'Cash in the Attic'. It's a show all about the junk people have gathering dust in the attic, that to the untrained eye looks like rubbish. Except experts give it a dust down to reveal priceless bits of treasure. Well God has more than a trained eye for hidden treasures. God's got a special heart for picking up the type of people who, seen through the world's eyes, seem as useless old junk. He just loves to dust down and polish up people so that their true worth can shine. Whenever somebody disses you, whenever you get that nagging voice in your head saying you'll never mount to much, whenever the world seems to have overlooked you, don't fret, because it's God's opinion that counts. Isaiah tells us that God sees us as '...precious and honoured in my sight'. Imagine that on your CV - the Lord God almighty, creator of everything says you are precious to Him. What more credentials for the job do you need? Maybe, it's about time you started to live it. Sadly, if you view yourself negatively, chances are people will talk down to you. But if you view yourself as God sees you, people will see somebody 'being transformed into his likeness'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We were like grasshoppers in our own sight.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 13:33 NKJV</span><br>We all do it, from time to time - look in the mirror and see a useless lump of lard as our reflection. The trick is to see ourselves through God's eyes. Numbers tells the tale of Moses sending 12 spies to check out the Promised Land, 10 came back saying, 'We saw...giants...and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight.' Even though earlier in the story God had showed them just how much He was behind them the spies still fell for that age old trick of seeing themselves as useless compared to everybody else. It's a shame when we forget that God is right behind us just because we're intimidated by someone or something. Maybe we know it as head knowledge, maybe we repeat it to ourselves parrot fashion, but we're never going to get the full impact in our lives, unless we get completely on board with how much God is for us. Jesus died for you!! That's right, for you!! Would God really have allowed His precious Son to die on the cross unless he thought you were more than worth it? God's so proud of you, He's like a doting parent who loves nothing better than to tell the world how fantastic He thinks you are! 
You're so not a grasshopper in His sight, so neither should you be in your own sight.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 26:3 NIV</span><br>ipods are great. You can bang nails into walls with them. You can use them as a float down the swimming baths. You can even wipe your bum with them. Well you could do all that, but you'd be a bit of a looney tune if you did, because that's not their purpose. Their purpose is to play your favourite tracks. Its the same with our lives, we can end up banging our heads against brick walls, or literally throw them down the toilet when we're not tuned into their real purpose. Isaiah knew what that felt like, 'I have laboured to no purpose; I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing' (Isaiah 49:4 NIV). In fact, so did Job, 'I give up; I am tired of living. Leave me alone. My life makes no sense' (Job 7:16 GNT). Without purpose we make choices on how we feel at the time rather than our commitment to our goal. Stressed and depressed is how we might feel when purpose goes awol. Peace of heart and mind is on the menu when we're on track with our God-given call. Give your life a going over, what things might be good to drop, what things might be good to focus on?  Just because you look busy doesn't mean you've got it all sussed, in fact, when you've got purpose you might be less busy - and less stressed! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Get some rest.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 6:31 NIV</span><br>Sometimes the biggest head-pecker isn't our Mum, Dad or teacher - it's ourselves! You beat yourself up because you're not this or you're not that, you didn't do this, you didn't do that. Guilt shouts you down, failure laughs in your face, and all you can do is nominate yourself for 'loser of the year'. Once you're at that stage, best pack your suitcase and send your brain for a well needed vacation. We all need a rest from time to time. 
Yeah, but isn't chilling out just being lazy? Of course not, even Jesus knew there was a time for chilling. Check out Mark 6:30-32: 'The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done...Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, &quot;Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.&quot; So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place' (Mark 6:30-32 NIV). Jesus understood that if you don't take a break, you'll break! So: a) make most of your time, get things done, but make sure you plan in decent chill out b) Go easy on yourself if you've not lived up to your own hyper-perfect standards c) Stop comparing yourself to swot of the year, you've got your own goals d) Chill, baby, chill! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Practice these things. Devote your life to them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 4:15 GWT</span><br>Why does change take so long? Well, first off because, we are slow learners. If it feels like you will just never ever understand what the heck Mr. Pythagoras has got to do with triangles, how much more will it take to change those nasty habits that stop you from growing. Don't panic though, The Bible is peppered with stories of God waiting patiently for people to change. For seconds, we've got to put our heads in reverse. The Good Book calls this, 'Taking off the old self, and putting on the new self' (Ephesians 4:22-23 NIV). We're all good at ditching our old threads once they look minging, well lets get good at ditching our minging attitudes and put on something with that fresh out of the box smell, like love, instead. Third reason change comes slow is pain. Remember how growing pains can ache good and proper - its the same with change - 9 times out of ten, there's no gain without pain. Hard truth is it'll more than likely be the tough times that ship-shape you into someone better. Finally, practice makes perfect. You don't instantly run a four minute mile without years of practice - just like, you don't instantly become Christ-like without years of practicing his wise words. That's why Paul tells it like it is, 'practice these things. Devote your life to them.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>So in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12 v 5 NIV</span><br>In life, and particularly in churches we can all have different opinions. Whole denominations are founded upon small differences in how they read the Bible; things that at the end of the day make no difference to whether you love God or whether you're spending eternity with Him! Using these differences to divide believers and split churches is one of satan's most powerful weapons. When a church is at war with itself, how easy is it for him to run riot outside the church? Churches have split opinions who can do what, how to worship, what we should be focussed on and even over the use of a hat in a Sunday meeting! How crazy is it that there are Christians who have fallen out over a hat? Evangelist Reinhart Bonke said that he was once criticised for having a woman preach the gospel at one of his African rallies. His response was that if he was drowning he would not care if he was rescued by a man or a woman. The truth is we don't live in a clear cut world and we can all interpret the Bible slightly differently. But if we agree on the important stuff then isn't it time to put aside petty differences and concentrate on what we have in common? Think and pray today what you can do to bring more unity in your community. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Don't get worked up.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:34 TM</span><br>Everything that can go wrong has! The computer has crashed and your assignment is due in the morning, your boyfriend has dumped you and your friends are acting downright weird, church is doing your head in, and your dog has been sick in your shoes. Remember:
1) God's still looking out for you. When things look bad, remind yourself that God is bigger than your problem: 'Don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.' 
2) Don't think about quitting! Every time you reach the breaking point it's a test. We have choices to make, do we quit and continually be blown around by the wind or stick with it and see it through. Paul was flogged, thrown in jail, shipwrecked and run out of town, but he refused to give in and in the end he was able to say, 'I have fought the good fight...finished the race, and... remained faithful' (2 Timothy 4:7 NLT). 
3) Your breaking point can be the start of a breakthrough. Ever heard the expression 'hitting the wall'? Runners use it when they're exhausted and feel like giving up. But athletes know if they push through the pain they'll get the 'second wind' that'll carry them over the finish line. So keep going; by God's grace you'll make it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'm awake all night.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 77:4 TM</span><br>You can't escape stress, but you can learn to cope with it by taking control of your life in small but important ways. Here are two: 
1) think about someone other than yourself. David was so frazzled that he was awake all night. Ever been there? That's when you need to 'Let...praises shape your worries into prayers, letting God know your concerns. Before you know it, a sense of God's wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle you down' (Philippians 4:6 TM). Elijah was depressed and suicidal when God showed him how to help himself. How? By leaving the cave he was hiding in, and going out and ministering to others. When we start supporting other people it puts our lives into perspective. Do you need help? Reach out to others. It's in 'connecting' that we are made whole! 
2) don't get bitter. When you're trying your absolute best and still rubbish things happen, it's easy to feel hard done by. As Christians we can forget that life isn't supposed to be smooth and easy, but God provides the support and love we need through the tough bits. Bitter people are sad people. When you're bitter it destroys relationships and cuts you off from God's presence. The answer is learning to 'thank God no matter what happens. This is the way God wants you...to live' (1 Thessalonians 5:18 TM). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When I was...beside myself, you calmed me down.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 94:19 TM</span><br>Before a violin can produce music, stress must be put on the strings but pull them too tightly and they'll snap. The same is true of you. Enough stress gets the juices flowing and helps you do what needs to be done, but beyond that you snap. Young people are faced with various types of pressure - family, expectations, exams, health, peer pressure, coursework. Before you start struggling, do two things:
1) ask for help: During Hurricane Katrina eight dolphins were swept out of their aquarium into the sea, but because they stuck together they were rescued. If one had tried to go it alone he'd have died. When you're alone too much you lose perspective. If the enemy can get you alone, he can influence you. God designed His family to stay connected or as Paul says, 'So that all the members care for each other' (1 Corinthians 12:25 NLT). 
2) get real with God: When you're stressed (and sometimes you don't realise you are until this happens) the build up of negative emotions come out through an explosion at the wrong people. This stress needs unloading on God! Look at the Psalms. It's no co-incidence that loads of them start with crying out to God then finish rejoicing because all the stress has been released! God loves when we cry out to him, so get venting!  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We who...believed are able to enter...God's rest.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:3 NCV</span><br>After spending months wandering round the wilderness, the Israelites developed a blame-culture. They blamed their enemies, they blamed Moses, they blamed each other, they even blamed God! As a result of their blaming and complaining they got fully stuck in the wilderness. Blaming other people is a huge issue problem today. Nothing is our fault! It's always the government, teachers, family, friends, police, council or whoever's fault. Never us! We start feeling sorry for ourselves and from there it spirals into a full-blown pity-party where the world is against us and life is Oh-so terrible. The truth is, ninety-nine percent of the time the solution begins with a change of attitude in you! Sometimes things happen and we need to learn from them. Sometimes God lets things happen to teach us. So we can blame others, feel sorry for ourselves and be utterly miserable or we can take responsibility, understand that things don't always work the way we think they should and understand that people aren't perfect. Do you know one of those people who are miserable and think the world is against them and no one cares? The truth is those people are really hard to care for because they're so self-pitying! People will be far more concerned for you when you're positive and trying to make the best of things. So start taking responsibility!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Pray for those who persecute you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:44 NIV</span><br>A soldier made it his goal to end each day with a Bible reading and prayer. As the others gathered in the barracks and went to bed, he'd kneel by his bunk. Some of them saw this and started dissing him. Then one night, he got on his knees like normal, and a heavy boot flew across the room and hit him in the face. The others mocked him, trying to pick a fight but the soldier never said a word. Next morning when the boot-thrower woke up he couldn't believe what he saw. There at the foot of his bed were his boots, polished and returned. Imagine shining the boots that kick you! That takes some guts and what Jesus calls grace! Some of the guys in the barracks were 'leaders', they love to mock and hate anyone that's different. Others were 'followers'; they weren't necessarily bad, just weak and afraid to be different. 
Why did Jesus pray from the cross, 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do'? Jesus understood that when people have been raised a certain way, they have problems and issues, and they need God too. He saw it as an opportunity to put God on display. Being this kind of person takes far more than going to church on a Sunday. It needs us to be Christ-like, example-setting, love-displaying people that make others sit up and take notice. Your 'rights', your pride and your wounded ego are not the issue; the One you represent is!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Their weakness was turned to strength.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:34 NLT</span><br>In nature, almost all animals have some form of weakness. Whether that is their size, shape, eyesight, teeth, diet or a whole load of other possibilities, there's always something that can be taken advantage of by a rival or a predator. However, as we can see from watching an animal documentary for more than five seconds, animals have an incredible way of turning these weaknesses into strengths. Being a small, slow animal may seem rubbish but you can fit into holes your predators can't. 
We all have weaknesses; some more than others. But as your strengths are God-given, is it not possible that some of your weaknesses may be too? You may be a stubborn so 'n' so but your stubbornness might just be the thing that enables you to kick that habit once and for all. You may have some physical problem that stops you getting out much, but maybe developing and using your mind is how you're going to impact the world. You may get easily bored and frustrated but maybe this could be used as motivation to make things better and get things changed, rather than stirring up negativity? Make a list today of your strengths and weaknesses. Go through this list and ask God, how can I use all these things for you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 37:7</span><br>The old saying, 'You can't always have what you want,' isn't necessarily true. When you 'Delight yourself in the Lord...he will give you the desires of your heart' (Psalm 37:4 NIV). 'Excellent' you're thinking, 'so when's my Nintendo Wii arriving?' Bad news... that's not what it means! You see, receiving the 'desires of our heart' isn't a reward for being good; it's much deeper than that. The verse actually has a secret double meaning! You see when we 'delight ourselves in the Lord' (hang out with Him, love Him, serve Him and generally realise what an awesome God He is), then a weird thing happens; His desires become our desires! Suddenly we want our friends to know Him the way we do. We want to see the local 'emo' kids learn what life's about and be happy. We want to see the poor made rich, the sick made healthy, the downright miserable people living life to the max. Suddenly He has literally given us our desires, and when what we want is also what He wants, of course we're going to receive them! Clever double meaning, eh! 
One of the frustrating things about this verse is that there's no time limit. We don't know when we will see them. Sometimes we just need to be faithful and trust that we will get those desires in the right time; His time. So be patient! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[I]...could never have made it apart from...mercy.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 1:15-17 TM</span><br>Often one of the hardest things about forgiveness is forgiving yourself. You can feel especially bad if you've done something that you criticised someone else for in the past! For example, it's easy to judge other people's relationships; 'they shouldn't be doing those things; oooo they should have more self control!'. But when suddenly you find yourself in a relationship, you may understand how easily you can make those mistakes yourself and your left feeling bad about what you've done AND the way you criticised others. It's easy to feel like the things you've done are to big for God to forgive, or even that you simply don't deserve forgiveness! This is particularly true when you know you didn't just make a mistake but made a calculated decision where you deliberately did something wrong, knowing you could ask forgiveness later. Remember what Paul said: 'Jesus...came...to save sinners. I'm proof; Public Sinner Number One ...someone who could never have made it apart from sheer mercy...evidence of his endless patience.' Before his conversion Paul persecuted the church, killing and torturing believers. It's how he made his living! Whatever you've done, it surely can't compare with that? If he could learn to forgive himself, you can too! In fact if you don't forgive yourself that's a bit of a proud attitude. You're not so special that you're the only one God can't forgive!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>People insulted Christ, but...He let God...take care of him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 2:23 NCV</span><br>A little boy who'd been rude to his Mum started sneaking off upstairs. 'Where you going, young man?' she asked. 'To my room to talk to God,' he replied. 'Isn't there something you want to tell me first?' she said. 'Nope,' he said, 'You'll just get mad. God will forgive me and forget about it.' Sometimes we upset someone and it's much easier to say sorry to God than to them, but actually we need to apologise to both. It's often much harder to admit we did wrong to another person than to God who knows it all anyway! Other times we can think we've forgiven someone but it's really obvious we've actually not. Some good clues are: getting angry when you think about them or whatever happened, ignoring or not wanting to see them, constantly reminding them of what happened, replaying the incident or conversations you'd like to have in your head. The Bible says that God won't share His right to settle old scores. He said, 'Vengeance is mine; I will repay' (Romans 12:19). If someone has wronged you it's up to God to deal with them, it's not your fight. When 'People insulted Christ...he did not insult them in return...He let God...who judges rightly, take care of him.' What's important is what happens in you, not to you. So forgive, forget, and move on! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Forgive - only then will your heavenly Father...wipe your slate clean.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 11:25 TM</span><br>How heavy is a glass of water? That depends on how far you have to carry it! A minute is no problem and after an hour your arm might ache. But after 24 hours you'll probably be in bad shape! The glass weighs exactly the same the whole time, but the longer you carry it the heavier it feels. It's the same with a grudge; it can get so heavy it stops you from living. 
People will hurt you; that's the reality of living anywhere except a desert island with a population of just you. Sometimes the hurt caused is cruel and intentional, but most of the time the person has no idea they even upset you. Does that mean you should go around pretending nothing's wrong? No, the first step is to be honest about how you feel, and when the hurt is deep this can be really hard!  That's when you need to pray, 'Lord, change my heart and heal me.' Jesus said, 'Pray for those who mistreat you' (Luke 6:28 NIV). When you do that an amazing thing happens; you start seeing them through God's eyes instead of your raw emotions. Jesus said, 'If you have anything against someone, forgive - only then will your heavenly Father...wipe your slate clean.' When you don't forgive, God can't forgive you! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Then you will understand what is right and just and fair.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 2:9 NIV</span><br>It's really hard to keep working hard at school or college, day after day when you've exams and starting work can seem so far away! It's when you're bored, in your worst lessons, learning about things you don't care about that you get a really good chance to develop your character. In those times you can mess about, write notes, cause trouble or work hard anyway! 
There's a prize-winner Russian novel called 'One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'. The hero of the story is a prisoner in a Siberian labour camp. He's forced to build a wall in freezing cold weather. As it gets darker and colder the foreman gives the order to hurry the job by throwing leftover mortar over the wall. But Ivan was determined to finish the job right. Eight years in a prison camp couldn't change his nature. Ivan was one of those people who wouldn't let anything go to waste without good reason. Eventually the foreman shouted at him and left him to it. Even in the dark, with the temperature at minus 20C, Ivan kept working. Only when he was sure that the wall was totally straight and even did he stop working. 
So, measured by Ivan's standard, what's your attitude to your work? Are you a fair-weather worker or will you keep going even when it gets tough?  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not be wise in your own eyes.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 3:7 NIV</span><br>To overcome your pride you must: 
1) recognise your pride. Benjamin Franklin observed, 'Not one of our natural passions is harder to subdue than pride. Even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.' It is a funny thing that as soon as we realise we're humble and not proud that we're proud again! Pride is something that can stop us, especially when we're young, from doing some amazing thing. We're so scared of looking stupid!  
2) be thankful. Paul writes, 'No matter what happens, always be thankful' (1 Thessalonians 5:18 TLB). Oprah Winfrey suggests, 'Keep a gratitude journal. Every night list five things that happened this day that you are grateful for. It will change your life. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you'll never have enough. If you focus on what you have, you will always see that the universe is abundant and you'll have more.' Selfish people never think they get as much as they deserve. If you're always thinking of things to be thankful for, that kind of pride will go!  
3) learn to laugh at yourself. The Chinese proverb says, 'Blessed are they that laugh at themselves for they shall never cease to be entertained.' Proud people don't find it easy to laugh at themselves. So today have a little chuckle at your own expense!  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I have...plans to give you the future you hope for.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 29:11 TM</span><br>Most young people don't have much clue about God's plans for their lives. You may have crazy dreams, secret passions, special skills, a very specific ambition but chances are you've not much idea where you'll be this time next week let alone in ten years time! Wherever you're at, it's 100% certain that God has a plan for your life. You're here for a reason, something designed just for you. 
So how do you find this special destiny? Just start where you are right now. When God puts your life on track, He starts by giving you hopes and dreams. Maybe you're wondering, 'Am I ever going to get to where I'm supposed to be?' If that's how you feel today, read these words from God to a group who'd spent their last 70 years in slavery after screwing up big time: 'I know what I'm doing. I have it all planned out; plans to take care of you, not abandon you, plans to give you the future you hope for. When you call on me, when you come and pray to me, I'll listen. When you come looking for me, you'll find me. Yes, when you get serious about finding me and want it more than anything else, I'll make sure you won't be disappointed...I'll turn things around for you' (Jeremiah 29:11-14 TM). Those words from God's mouth are for you too!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>His sheep follow him because they know his voice.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 10:4 NIV</span><br>One evening two old friends got together. One told the other that he could hear 18 different kinds of crickets (grasshoppers) in his garden. The other was amazed; he'd lived around there for years and never even heard one! The difference was, this friend was a professor of the study of insects who'd learned to tell the difference between 200 different cricket calls with his natural ears. How mad is that! Looking back, the first friend wrote, 'I suddenly understood that a person must want to hear, and learn to hear, and there were many sounds I was not hearing.' It's not enough just to want to hear God's voice, we need to learn what it sounds like in all its amazing variety. 
God speaks in loads of ways and one of those is through people. The problem is, when you only hear from God through someone else it's easy to ignore or doubt what you've heard. But when you know God is speaking right to you personally, you can't just ignore it. Jesus said, 'His sheep follow him because they know his voice' (John 10:3-4 NIV). Even the most useless of Bible characters did great things because they clearly knew God's voice when he spoke. Nothing in your life is more important than learning to know God's voice when He speaks to you!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>That special gift...you were given...keep that dusted off and in use.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 4:14 TM</span><br>When you go to a job interview one question that often gets asked is: 'what are your strengths and your weaknesses?' Sometimes it's easier to come up with our weaknesses and these are often what we think we should focus on if we want to become better people. Paul told Timothy to focus on his strengths. 'That special gift...you were given...keep that dusted off and in use.' Focused people don't hide their weaknesses or excuse them; but instead they focus on their strengths. Tony Campolo says, 'What you commit yourself to, will change what you are and make you into a completely different person. The future conditions you, not the past. What you commit yourself to become, determines what you are; more than anything that ever happened to you yesterday. Therefore, I ask you, &quot;What are your commitments? Where are you going? What are you going to be? Show me somebody who hasn't decided, and I'll show you somebody who has no identity, no personality, no direction.&quot;' Focusing on weaknesses instead of strengths is like having a handful of coins, a few made of gold, the rest of tarnished copper, and setting aside the gold coins to spend your time shining the copper ones in hopes of making them more valuable. No matter how long you spend, they'll never be worth what the gold ones are. So, stay focused on your God-given strengths!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Forgetting the past.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:13 NLT</span><br>1) Focused people don't live in the past. 
Sometimes we can focus on the wrong thing: the hairs growing out of your dad's nose, the legs of that boy or girl you fancy and what has happened in our past. 
We all have mess in our past; some of it we caused with bad decisions and actions, some of it is the hurt that others cause us. Although we need to learn from the past we mustn't let it hold us back. Earlier in the month we talked about how runners 'fix their eyes on the finishing line'. They can't afford to look behind; many races have been lost that way! Don't focus on the past, focus on the new start and future that God gives you each day. 
2) Focused people don't think about the difficulties, but the rewards. If you dwell on the difficulties too long you'll start to develop self-pity instead of self-discipline. By focusing on results you'll stay encouraged. Make Christ your example. 'He was willing to die a shameful death on the cross because of the joy he knew would be his afterwards' (Hebrews 12:2 TLB). 
3) Focused people choose their friends carefully. Some people know the person you are focused on becoming and they help you, encourage you, even tell you when you get off track. It's simple: hang out with these guys! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 3:6 NIV</span><br>When it comes to staying focused, keep in mind: 
1) focused people always look for a better way. Don't just settle for what you already know. An American family who moved into a new neighbourhood had a late start one morning. As a result their six year old missed her school bus. Though it would make him late for work her dad agreed to take her to school if she gave him directions. After 20 minutes of going in circles they finally arrived at the school, which turned out to be only a few blocks away from where they lived. Steaming, her dad asked why she drove him all over the place when the school was so close to home. 'We went the way the school bus does,' she said, 'that's the only way I know.' God wants us to learn new things
2) focused people concentrate a little harder and a little longer. A famous baseball player said, 'What separates a superstar from the average ballplayer is that he concentrates just a little bit longer.' Focused thinking is the ability to remove distractions and mental clutter so that you can concentrate with clarity 
3) focused people make commitments, not excuses. That's why praying and getting direction from God is so important. When you know it's from God you can commit. 
&quot;In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not swerve to the right or the left.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 4:27 NIV</span><br>Focus does three things for you: 
1) Focus keeps you on target. Ever found yourself pulled in a dozen different directions, spending loads of our time and energy on things you don't really care about (not including the washing up)? One author put it like this: 'Ours is a world where people don't know what they want, and are willing to go through hell to get it.'  The Bible says: 'Let your eyes look straight ahead...Do not swerve to the right or the left' (Proverbs 4:25-27 NIV). 
2) Focus increases your energy. Attempting everything, like attempting nothing, will suck the life out of you. Focus gives you energy. Admiral Richard Byrd, the Polar explorer, said, 'Few men come anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them. There are deep wells of strength that are never used.' You have what it takes to go much further and faster but that won't happen without focus. Focus helps you dig deep.
3) Focus lifts you. Just knowing what you want to do and making an effort to chase it down, sets you apart from almost everybody else. Just by striving to become better than you are, you become elevated even if you don't accomplish what you desire, and even if others don't step aside for you. By trusting God and aiming higher, you move to a higher level.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let's keep focused...those of us who want everything God has for us.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:15 TM</span><br>When you were younger did you ever sit with a magnifying glass trying to focus a beam of sunlight to try to set fire to some paper, a spider, or maybe even your brother or sister?! Its amazing what focused light can do. In fact, when light is focused as a laser beam, it can cut through steel. In the same way, nothing is as potent as a focused life. The men and women who make the greatest difference in life are often the most focused. The Apostle Paul said, 'I am bringing all my energies to bear on this one thing' (Philippians 3:13 TLB). Paul's obsession was to make Christ known. God will have a focus for your life too. If you want your life to have impact, focus it! Stop trying to do it all. Do less. Be willing to turn away from good activity to do only that which matters most. Doing lots of stuff doesn't mean you're doing the right stuff. Poet William Matthews wrote, 'One well-cultivated talent, deepened and enlarged, is worth a hundred shallow faculties [abilities]'. The first law of success in this day, when so many things are clamouring for attention, is concentration.'  In other words , figure out what God wants you to do and focus. Does focus come easily or naturally? No, it's a discipline that must be practiced every day.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You become the slave of whatever you choose to obey.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 6:16 NLT</span><br>Walk into any newsagents and you will see loads of celebrity magazines. People who SEEM so important we want to look at pictures of them taking their dog for a walk or grabbing a latte. You've heard of Posh and Becks but have you heard of Clara Bow and Victor Fleming? Clara and Victor were one of the celebrity couples of the 1920s. They were massive news at the time and were as talked about as much as Brad and Angelina bu,t 80 odd years later, you've got no idea who they are. One of the problems of our culture seems to be an obsession with stuff that doesn't last long. 
'All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass. The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever' (Isaiah 40:6-8). We spend so much energy and time thinking, reading and talking about people who will be forgotten in 100 years (or if they're Big Brother contestants 100 days!). Isaiah reminds us that God is an amazing, powerful and awesome God who is eternal. His glory won't fade, His word stands forever. So, put down your celeb mag, pick up a Bible and get obsessed with Jesus.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 4:23</span><br>The best talk that Jesus gives on worship wasn't at a big worship conference but next to a well with a Samaritan woman that His mates didn't even think He should be talking to! Here are just three things He said: 
1) Anybody can do it! It doesn't matter where you are from, who your family is, what your past is like. If you love God you and He is 'number 1' in your life, you can worship. The Samaritan women didn't fit into the mould of a 'good religious person' but that wasn't a problem for Jesus. He was interested in her heart.
2) You can worship anywhere: The Jews worshipped in the temple in Jerusalem, the Samaritans worshipped on a mountain, but Jesus said it doesn't matter! You can be in a car, in a church, in a tent, in a field, in a bus shelter, in a bath, you can use DJs or church organs or silence; Jesus accepts your worship. Jesus said, 'True worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth' (John 4:23 NIV)
3) That God is actually looking for people who will do it. God created you to do the only thing He cannot do for Himself; worship! We were actually created to worship God! Think: worth-ship! How much do you value the Lord? We never get tired of talking about what we value most!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:12 NASB</span><br>Sitting at an exam desk with a pencil case rammed with spare pens, your 'lucky' mascot and the dreaded exam paper is probably not high on your list of good times. Not many of us like tests but they are an important part of life. Whether it's a football trial, a driving test, an exam or some kind of competition, remember how good it felt when you found out that you'd made it, you'd passed! 
The Bible talks about trials and tests, not the kind that will get you the use of your dad's car, but some of the tough stuff that life throws at us. Illness, rejection, disappointment, betrayal, violence are just a few of the trials that Christians, like everyone else in the world, will face. These kinds of difficulties and hardships can feel like they are crushing us and leave us wanting to give up on our relationship with God. Check out what the book of James says: 'Anyone who meets a testing challenge head-on and manages to stick it out is mighty fortunate. For such persons loyally in love with God, the reward is life and more life' (James 1:12 MSG). Passing your school exams or tests opens up new opportunities in life, if you stick at it through life's hardships God opens up what the Bible calls 'Abundant Life'; and that's very cool. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Commit your way to the Lord.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalms 37:5</span><br>One day a kid playing with an expensive porcelain vase got his hand stuck in it and couldn't get it out. Before resorting to breaking the vase, his dad said, 'Son, relax, just open your hand and pull it out.' To his dad's astonishment the lad said, 'I can't. If I do I'll drop the 20p.' 
A lot of us are just like that kid, so busy holding onto something of little worth that we are on the edge of breaking something much more valuable; our lives! Let go of that thing you're holding onto; it isn't worth it! Let God have His way, 'Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this' (Psalm 37:3-5). The words, 'trust, delight, and commit' are your keys to success. Give up trying to handle life by yourself. Put it into God's hands and allow Him to work. He's not stumped by what going on in your life right now. Check His record of achievement! Do you seriously think your problem is too big for Him, or that He can't do it without your help? Come on, give it to God and watch what happens! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You do not realise now what I am doing, but later you will.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 13:7 NIV</span><br>Mary and Martha were upset that, even though they sent urgent messages to Him, Jesus didn't arrive on the scene until their brother Lazarus was dead. 'Lord...if you had been here, my brother would not have died' (John 11:21 &amp; 32 NIV). But instead of giving them excuses, Jesus replied, 'Did I not tell you...if you believed, you would see [God glorified in this?]' (John 11:40 NIV). 
When God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac he didn't understand, but later he witnessed God's faithfulness when Isaac was returned to him totally unharmed. Joseph didn't know why his brothers mistreated him or why he was imprisoned unfairly, but later he understood it when looked back and saw God's hand in everything that had happened. His father questioned why Joseph had been taken away from him, but later, looking into the face of the man who had been made governor and who'd saved the lives of the nation, God's purposes became clear.
That's why Jesus said to Mary and Martha, 'You do not realise now what I am doing, but later you will.' God doesn't expect you to understand, but He does expect you to trust Him. This might feel really tough right now but you can trust God. Make sure the experience isn't making you bitter but is making you better by causing you to draw closer to Him?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If the Lord is with us, why has...this happened?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 6:13 NIV</span><br>The must-have designer bling of 100 years ago was lace, and Germany's exclusive textile mills were like the GUCCI of the lace world. Each room was dark, except for the light falling from a small window onto the weaver's work. That's because lace can be made more beautifully with more special details when the weaver is in darkness and his work is in the light. 
Have you ever felt like Gideon who said, 'If the Lord is with [me], why has...this happened?' When life goes pear-shaped, doesn't make sense and everything seems dark, check out this promise He makes to His people, 'I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the Lord ...who [calls] you by name' (Isaiah 45:3 NIV). Like the lace makers, God can make something beautiful in the darkness. Sometimes He is changing us, sometimes he is changing the circumstances. When the Israelites faced their greatest challenge, the Red Sea, the Bible says, 'All that night the Lord drove the sea back' (Exodus 14:21 NIV). He is working even though you can't see Him. Anybody can 'big up' God in good times, but trusting Him in dark times takes that special kind of commitment that is spelt F-A-I-T-H. The best part is that the bible describes faith as a gift - a gift that God wants to give you today.  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 12:2 NIV</span><br>The Bible says: 'Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.' Maybe you've heard preachers say Jesus is like the finishing line in a race; in the same way a runner would focus on the tape we should fix our eyes on Jesus. Well yes, maybe that's one way of looking at it. But another perspective would be that Jesus isn't just like the finish line in the race of life, He's also a fellow-runner. In His human life He showed us how to run the race like a champion; He set the world record!  One of the things great athletes do is study the films of champions to discover their techniques; maybe we need to study Christ and check out His moves. Rewind and watch the tape over and over and you'll see obedience, surrender, love and selflessness to name but a few of Jesus' champion moves. Today we'll look at just one. Do you want to be like Christ? Begin thinking less about yourself. Work toward becoming unselfish. For one full day, let go of anything that puts you first and others second. On that same day, fix your attention on Jesus by surrendering in complete selflessness. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>This treasure...is from God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 4:7 NIV</span><br>Do you know you have hidden treasure inside you? God put it there. It's YOUR unique qualities and gifts. This treasure within you 'is from God,' but God is a bit like those millionaires in the Dragon's Den TV programme; when He invests He expects a return! He wants you to use the investment well! 
Someone said the wealthiest spot of land on this planet is not an oilfield, diamond mine or treasure island; the real treasures lie in your local cemetery. That might sound a bit morbid but buried beneath those sacred stones are dreams that never came to pass, songs that were never sung, books that were never written, ideas that were never shared, inventions that were never designed. Only a tiny percentage of those who live on this planet will discover and fulfil their true potential. Do you want to be one of them? Ask yourself: 'Who am I? What is my treasure? Why did God put me here? How can I maximise my abilities for His glory?' Get the answers to these questions and life gets exciting! 
Don't worry if you haven't found your life's purpose yet, talk to God. 'Everything...finds its purpose in him' (Colossians 1:16 TM). Remember that before you spoke your first word or took your first step, God had a plan for your life. Keep listening to Him! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Find out and do whatever the Lord wants you to.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 5:17 TLB</span><br>Have you got something important to do that you keep putting off till tomorrow? 
a) its up to YOU. No matter how hard you wish, the tooth fairy isn't going to come while you're sleeping and sort this one. A Chinese proverb says 'Great souls have wills, feeble souls have wishes.' YOU need to do something! 
b) check out your excuses. An excuse puts the blame on someone or something other than you, which is handy, but doesn't get the thing done! Is there really a good reason why it hasn't happened or are you just starting to believe your own excuses?. Check out your mouth; zip it when you feel an excuse coming on
c) focus on the upside. To get you over the hump, focus on what you'll 'get out of it' when you get it done. What is the upside?  Fix your eyes on the prize! 
d) ask for help. One person doesn't win the World Cup the whole squad does.  Speaking of the church, Paul writes, 'Each part...helps the other parts grow' (Ephesians 4:16 NLT). Often we can't do what we want on our own. It takes guts to tell someone what you want to achieve and ask their help. But the risk is worth taking. Problems become smaller when you confront them. Touch a nettle timidly and it stings you, grasp it tightly and it crumbles in your hand.]]></introtext>

b) putting on our best tough act! When we feel rejected we imagine we're being attacked even when we're not. So we put on our boxing gloves and come out swinging 
c) pushing others away. Who needs other people anyway? As a result nobody is allowed close enough to meet our needs
d) people pleasing by doing anything to get people to like us or let others treat us like dirt because we think it's what we deserve and it may be our last chance at love 
e) practicing perfectionism. Human standards vary so much that you'll never make everybody happy. Give it up! God already loves you unconditionally.
'Our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are.' And 'that's only the beginning...when Christ is...revealed, we'll...become like him' (1 John 3:2 TM). If you don't you see yourself as God sees you, what others think can cut deep. Worst of all, you'll never discover or be discovered for the unique and wonderful person God made you to be. The best rejection projection? Get a true view of you...and that's God's view.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 27:1 NIV</span><br>Chuck Swindoll writes, 'The plane was headed for New York; a routine...flight. But this time it proved to be otherwise. As they were on their descent pattern the pilot realised that the landing gear was not engaging. He messed around with the controls, trying again and again to get the gear to lock in place...without success. He then asked ground control for instructions. As the plane circled the landing field and emergency crews coated the runway with foam, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles moved into position. Meanwhile the passengers were told to manoeuvre in that calm, unemotional voice pilots do so well. Flight attendants glided about the cabin with an air of cool reserve. Passengers were told to place their heads between their knees and grab their ankles just before impact. There were tears, panic and cries of despair...the pilot announced over the intercom, &quot;We are beginning our final descent. At this moment... it is my obligation to inform you that if you believe in God you should commence prayer.&quot; 
So what's the message? Live each day in the light of eternity. Seize the moment and wring every drop out of it. Love and enjoy the people who matter most to you - and reach out with compassion to the people who society says don't matter at all. Run towards God's plan for your life. In other words, before you die, live! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I gave her time to repent.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Revelation 2:21 NLT</span><br>When God tells you to repent, He gives you time and grace to do it. If you don't, there will be consequences. That doesn't mean that God is dreaming up some cruel punishment for you - it just means that you reap what you sow. For every action there is a reaction. If you choose to keep living life by your own rules you will reach a place where your ability to say 'no' is so weakened that you become a slave to what your habits and your lifestyle. As long as desire the rewards your sin brings, you won't want freedom from it. One counsellor writes: 'I kept trying not to commit a particular sin, praying about it over and over, only to do it again. Finally I got mad at God and cried out, &quot;Why don't you help me with this?&quot; He answered, &quot;Because you aren't disgusted with it yet. You're still enjoying it.&quot; I protested, &quot;I do not. I hate it.&quot; God replied, &quot;If you hated it enough you'd quit it.&quot; In that moment I realised that I enjoyed the rewards of my sin more than the rewards of obedience. Repentance is a gift of love which comes from God. And until that love is allowed to work in us, touching and exposing those carefully guarded areas, we cannot change.' So, today, ask God for the gift of repentance.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 3:5 NIV</span><br>Writer Cliff Schimmels tells this story about the days before cars: 'When I was young my dad had a team of horses. One day he said to me, &quot;Son, would you like to drive?&quot; So I took the reins. I was in control. I was driving. But the plodding bothered me, it was too slow. So I clucked the horses along and they began to trot. Then Babe and Blue came up with a better idea. They decided that if they ran we would get home faster.... As the prairie-dog holes whizzed by I concluded that we were in a dangerous situation, so I tried my best to slow down the runaway team. I tugged on the reins until my hands cramped. I cried and pleaded, but nothing worked. Old Babe and Blue just kept running. I glanced over at my dad and he was just sitting there, watching the world go by.... My hands were cut from the reins, tears streaming down my face, frozen from the winter cold. Finally in desperation I turned to my dad and said, &quot;Here, take the reins, I don't want to drive any more.&quot; 
There's always that moment when the only way out is to turn to our Heavenly Father and say, 'Here, take the reins, I don't want to drive any more.' And He will, but you've got to hand them to Him!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Isn't this the carpenter?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 6:3 NIV</span><br>Be careful around those who love to say, 'I knew you when...' in an attempt to label or limit you. You need to understand this: your decision to step out and follow God will put pressure on others and the first place you'll feel it will be with those closest to you, especially if it means you start progressing in life more quickly than them. The Bible says that Eliab (David's bro) 'was angry at him and said, &quot;What are you doing here, anyway? Who's taking care of that little flock of sheep out in the desert? You spoiled brat!&quot;', (1 Samuel 17:28 CEV). Before David could beat Goliath he had to beat the opinions of those around him - and you will too! 
Look at the life of Jesus. When He went back to His hometown they said, 'What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son...And they took offence at him. Jesus said to them, &quot;Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honour.&quot; He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of faith' (Mark 6:2-6 NIV). Bottom line: be careful around those 'who knew you when...']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Slowly, steadily, surely, the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Habakkuk 2:3 TLB</span><br>When God gives you a vision, He also gives you the provision needed to fulfil it! Often He'll use something you already possess even though you don't know it. Faced with feeding 5000 hungry people, the disciples felt totally useless. They weren't in one of the big towns or cities where they could run around the local shops - they were in the middle of nowhere! But Jesus said, 'How many loaves do you have...Go and see' (Mark 6:38 NIV). God will open your spiritual eyes to see what you already have or is within your reach. He'll bless it and then get you using it!
Stop making excuses, feeling sorry for yourself, talking yourself down or being intimidated by people who say you don't have what it takes. Listen to God! He's provided everything to get you to where you need to be. Paul writes, 'Now glory be to God who by his mighty power at work within us is able to do far more than we could ever dare to ask or even dream of - infinitely beyond our highest prayers, desires, thoughts, or hopes' (Ephesians 3:20 TLB). Notice the words 'far more' and 'his mighty power at work within us.' Look in the mirror and say, 'I am full of resources. God has given me everything I need to fulfil His plan for my life.' This isn't hype, pride or mind-over-matter. It's faith talk!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Slowly, steadily, surely, the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Habakkuk 2:3 TLB</span><br>When David volunteered to fight Goliath Saul tried to get him to go out to battle wearing his suit of armour. Dave put it on and it was too heavy and didn't fit him; he could hardly move let alone fight. Don't try to be something you're not just to look the part; if you do you'll find that you're restricted and uncomfortable because you're not being you. God made you unique and gave you a part to play in His plan for the world. Many people wear themselves out trying to fulfil a vision God didn't give them because they need to prove themselves to someone. Other people have unresolved issues that they wrap up in the appearance of a vision from God but really they're just trying to win a parent's love, or to demonstrate they're as talented as their brother or sister. Don't make this mistake or you'll end up frustrated and feeling like you failed 
God didn't promise to give you what He gave others. You're unique, so is God's plan for your life. If you're not 'graced' to do it, you'll wear yourself out. Maybe the grass is greener on the other side but it still needs cutting! If you're trying to do someone else's job you'll just feel pants. Every call has it's cost; but if you're doing what God told you then he'll help you handle it!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Slowly, steadily, surely, the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Habakkuk 2:3 TLB</span><br>Visions aren't for the immature, the impatient, or people who like life comfy and cosy; so if you still like your dummy, or if you can't get out from under that duvet, this isn't for you... but if you like adventure you've come to the right place! Listen: In the early stages of pregnancy a baby is easier to lose. It's the same when God gives you vision; you need to protect it. The enemy tried to destroy Moses and Jesus before they reached their second birthday. Why? He feared what they would become and he fears you too! When a woman is pregnant, she has to cut out things that could harm the baby; like smoking and alcohol. To see your vision become a reality will mean daring to be different, even radical; not hanging out with the neggy crowd and getting your priorities straight. Sometimes you need to choose your purpose over your popularity! If you think fulfilling a vision is easy, check the price tag! Like childbirth, it's hard work, it's painful. So before you make any snap decisions, or mess around with God's purpose for your life, ask yourself, 'Can I see this through to the end?  Esther's vision meant putting her life on the line and saying, 'If I die, I die (Esther 4:16 NCV). Did she die? No, but she had to be willing to. Are you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Holding on to faith and a good conscience.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 1:19 NIV</span><br>In the bible Paul writes to Timothy warning him to keep his conscience grounded in God's word. Loads of Tim's mates hadn't kept a tight hold of God and because of that Paul said they had become like sailing ships that had lost their way and been dashed on the rocks! What a depressing picture! The saying, 'Let conscience be your guide,' needs a bit adding to it: '...as long as your conscience is rooted in God.' When we want to do our own thing and go our own way, we justify it by saying, 'If it feels so right it how can it be wrong?' Understand this: if God's Word says something is wrong, it's wrong; no matter how right it feels! There's no wriggle room! When you make all of your choices based on how you feel at that moment in time you could run the risk of the winds of temptation, compromise and comfort sweeping you off course and ending up shipwrecked. The Apostle John gives us an all important reason for keeping our conscience in good repair: 'If we don't feel guilty, we can come to God with bold confidence. And we will receive from him whatever we ask because we obey him and do the things that please him' (1 John 3:21-22 NLT). That's better than the seaweed option any day! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I am persuaded beyond doubt... that... [nothing] will be able to separate us from the love of God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:38 - 39 AMP</span><br>Do you ever categorise sin? Obviously murder is a 10. Lying is maybe a 4-6 depending what the lie is; talking about somebody being their back is only a 1 coz they'll never find out! Sounds stupid, but sometimes we try to kid ourselves that God thinks of sin in the same way! No Way! In God's eyes sin is sin! That's why the whole world's been in chaos just because Adam and Eve ignored God and took what was labelled 'Not for Human Consumption'. God's standard is 'perfection' and you couldn't reach it in a thousand lifetimes. Thank God for Jesus and His grace, God's incredible favour, is the only hope any of us has! Your level of love will always relate to the level of forgiveness you've received. Jesus taught that those who have been forgiven loads, love loads! (See Luke 7:47). 
'...God was in Christ, offering peace and forgiveness to the people of this world' (2 Corinthians 5:19). Your whiteboard's been wiped clean. Now He says, 'Come and be reconciled to Me. Let's have a relationship. You've nothing to fear, for nothing can separate you from My love.' Listen: 'I am persuaded beyond doubt... that... [nothing] will be able to separate us from the love of God.' (Romans 8:38-39) Doesn't it blow your mind to think that nothing, absolutely nothing, can ever cause God to turn His back on you!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Take a lesson from the ants</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Prov 6:6 NLT </span><br>If it hasn't cost you, it's not worth having! Have you ever watched an ant carrying home a piece of bread that's ten times bigger than itself? How does it do that? Even the bible points it out as an example of the kind of determination that's needed to get the juice out of life. You could put it like this: success belongs to those too small to carry what they believe in but too stubborn to leave it behind! If God the Creator lives within you, then you are 'creative'. If success doesn't come after you, get up and go after it. 
A young man once asked an old man, 'What's the secret of your success?' 'Good decisions,' he replied. 'How did you learn to make good decisions?' the young man asked. 'By making bad ones,' the old man replied. Once you discover your gift and identify your dream, get going! Stop waiting for opportunity. Opportunity is the breath in your body and the strength of your mind. If you use your God-given gifts wisely, there's no telling what you can do. But you must be a 'doer'! God isn't going to drop everything into your lap. A God-given dream is supposed to become reality. God will give you the power to succeed but you have to take it, get your focus right, work hard and don't give up! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Does anyone dare despise this day of small beginnings?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Zechariah 4:10</span><br>There was this guy called Dwight, he grew up with loads of brothers and sisters, not much education and only his widowed mother to look after him. She made Dwight go to church but he couldn't get his head round all the 'churchy spiritual talk'. At 17 he left home and moved to the city to work in his uncles shoe shop - on the condition that he went to church every week. One day a bloke in the church told Dwight about God's love for him and he gave his life to Jesus. Dwight knew nothing about the Bible so people looked down on him and assumed that God wouldn't use him...But they were wrong! God saw in the heart of Dwight Moody the raw material necessary to make a communicator of His Word and a changer of nations. That's exactly what Dwight became! 
Every oak tree starts as an acorn. Jesus began in a stable but He didn't stay there. David was a shepherd but he became King. Joseph was sold as a slave but he became Prime Minister. Why? Because '... God was with him... gave him favour and wisdom... made him Governor over Egypt... '(Acts 7:9-10 NKJ). Whatever you have today is enough to create anything you'll ever need in your future. Just put it into God's hands and be willing to start small.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He trains my hands for battle</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 18:34 NIV</span><br>In order to get fit for the purpose God has for you you'll need to follow this training program: 1) say 'no' to negativity: be ruthless with bad thoughts 2) don't be a 'belly button Christian' (just focused on yourself) put other people's needs first 3) Eat the word: as you feed on God's word you are made strong 4) listen to the still small voice: it's unlikely that God will use a lighting bolt from heaven to get your attention every time!  Don't rush your time with Him and you'll notice the difference. 5) shift to a higher gear of faith: to go faster and cover more ground you have to hit the high gears. That means gathering momentum - just like riding a bike you'll never get any speed up if you're always stopping and starting again 6) get the right friendships: God's into community not just individuals. In community you find out what people are truly made of and you can be there for each other when the tough times come. Treasure your God given friends  7) ask God to give you understanding about the place you're in. Knowing you're in training for your destiny will keep you from pulling back, following the crowd or chucking in the towel. The word for you today is: press through and get fit for purpose!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Heb 1:1 NIV</span><br>Jacob woke up one morning after having an encounter with God the night before and said, 'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it' (Genesis 28:16 NIV).  God got Jacob's attention, gave him a shake and woke up some stuff that had been snoozing in Jacob for a long time:  1. the desire above all else to hear from God 2. the courage to believe God when He speaks 3. the boldness to get out there and do it! Do those 3 things need waking up in you today? 
When you mix those 3 things together you've got yourself a recipe for Faith! God will speak to you but He won't force you to do anything. You have to make a choice to believe what He says and then do it. When God speaks to us He often does it through people. You are in a process of learning to recognise His voice. Don't be afraid of 'getting it wrong' Jesus knows that we're still learners with our 'L' plates on! There's one simple way to get to know God's voice - read His word! Listen: 'All scripture is God - breathed' (2 Tim 3:16) How cool is that! You've got a book of words straight from God's heart to yours! If you live by what He says about you it will change your life forever.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Heb 1:1 NIV</span><br>What is faith? 'Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.' (Heb 11:1 NIV) How do you get faith? Listen: 'Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.' (Rom 10:17 NKJ) There's a difference between having a positive outlook on life and being a person who has faith. Being positive will make you feel good but it won't change your circumstances; but the Word of God does! The writer to the Hebrews says that God's word is a powerful like a sword. (Heb 4:12 NIV) So imagine the breakthroughs you can be part of if you choose to believe God's word and then you speak that word over your circumstances. For example you might be having a tough time because the devil is telling you lies like, 'you're rubbish and a failure'. If that's the case then instead of agreeing with him take God's word and agree with that instead! Start today by getting your tongue around some of the awesome promises that are yours in Jesus, go on, say it out loud: 'God's word says that He has good plans for my life (Jer 29:11). With God on my side I can do anything because he has made me a winner not a loser (Rom 8:37). I was made to silence the enemy with my praises.' (Psalm 8:2) Now you're talking faith! ]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Attitude Check?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Lord is the judge of our motives.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:2 CEV</span><br>Writer Isabel Wolseley says, 'I'm a placid, get-along-with-everybody person. But that changed when my friend and I had a disagreement. I told her I was right, and why, and others commended me for having been right. The trouble is, I didn't feel any better...I felt worse. &quot;Lord,&quot; I prayed, &quot;You know I was right, so why do I feel so terrible?&quot; I stewed for several days then I sensed His answer: &quot;Yes, you were right, but your attitude was wrong!&quot; I asked my friend to forgive me. She did, and our relationship was restored. This happened several years ago, and you know what? I can't even remember what the argument was about.'
What's more important; you're need to be right, or your mate's feelings? As usual the bible has just the right words for us in this situation: 'Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.'(Jam 1:19 NIV) Ask yourself, 'Why do I want to win this argument so badly? To look good, make a point or try and sound clever?' Check this out: 'We may think we know what is right, but the Lord is the judge of our motives.' (Prov 16:2) Paul writes, 'Let the Spirit change your way of thinking' (Eph 4:23 CEV). Bottom line: when you listen to the Holy Spirit He will tell you when you need to change your attitude.]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[ Activity vs Intimacy]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 16:15 NIV</span><br>Activity can never replace intimacy. There are loads of people in your life that you do different things with - shopping, footie, even maybe homework every now and again! But God doesn't want to be just like a mate you hang about with, God wants to be as close to you as the hairs on the back of your neck and the lines in the palms of your hands. And he wants you to be in His will and on His wavelength. So how can this become a reality for you today? 
Paul gives us an answer in 1 Corinthians 2, verse 14, 'The unspiritual self, just as it is by nature, can't receive the gifts of God's Spirit.' (TM) He goes on to say that the things of God are 'silliness' to that part of us. So getting to a place of more intimacy with God means doing stuff that unlocks a deeper part of our identity. This is why Christians pray, worship and sometimes even skip meals (fasting). These are just some of the ways God has made available to get around the 'unspiritual' part of us to connect more directly with God. 
Intimacy of any kind is rare today, true intimacy that is, not the intimacy you can get round the back of the disco after a few White Lightning's. But spiritual intimacy, that's something really, really special and is worth giving everything to find. ]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>An enemy did this</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 13:28 NIV</span><br>Matthew chapter 13 contains an eye-opening story that revolves around a scene from a farmer's field. Like most of Jesus' parables it leaves us wondering how we are meant to understand it. Well, one way is that while God is planting wheat (truth) the enemy is planting weeds (lies). The truth and the lies are growing side by side in the same field! 
Imagine your life is like that field. Everyday there are loads of people wanting to plant stuff in it - both seeds and weeds! Through TV, through magazines, through the internet, not to mention your teachers, parents and friends, all sorts of mixed messages are coming your way - truth, half-truth and downright lies! Thankfully, because you have the Holy Spirit living in you it is possible to recognise when, 'An enemy did this.'
The parable contains a subtle warning too, an encouragement to stay alert: 'While everyone was sleeping, his enemy ...sowed weeds among the wheat' (Matthew 13:25 NIV). We all know that the only people who talk to you while you're asleep are hypnotists.  So wake up before you are conned into doing something you'll regret! Think it's no big deal? One degree off course may seem harmless enough, but stay on that track and you'll soon end up a long, long way from where God wants you to be.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God's gift to us is...happiness.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ecclesiastes 3:13 CEV</span><br>All of us have to do things out of a sense of duty, not joy. You know what it's like, you go and visit grumpy uncle Fred on Boxing Day every year because he happens to be your mum's brother. Yes, his house smells and he never remembers your name but you have go, it's your duty  because he's family.  So maybe it's not such a big deal to visit uncle Fred once a year - but what if everything in your life was in that category - that's no way to live. And yet some people treat the Christian life like that. It's as if following Jesus has been reduced to a list of boring and annoying things that you have to do now because you're in God's family. If that sounds anything like you today you need to know that's not how God wants you to live. God has wired you to thrive through times of fun and relaxation. They're not unspiritual! Without them you become unbalanced and you open yourself to mood swings and stress-related illnesses. Yes, you're called to help others, but it's not wrong to do things for yourself, to receive from God, and those He sends to bless you. If somebody compliments you, accept it graciously; if they want to give you a gift, thank them warmly; it's your duty to receive as much as it is to give! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In everything God works for the good of those who love him...because that was his plan.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:28 NCV</span><br>Be careful you don't get too comfortable - if you do God might just stir things up!  The mother eagle teaches her little ones to fly by making their nest so uncomfortable that they're forced out of it. Next they're literally pushed off the cliff edge! Can you imagine their thoughts: 'What's going on - I thought you loved meeeeeeeeeeeee!' 
Who and where you are at this moment in time is totally within range of God's plan - no matter what comes your way to divert, distract or disable you there's no way you'll ever be out of his sight. In His wisdom He knows that you need the challenge of certain situations to mature you. Yes, even those people who rub you the wrong way are actually making you more like Jesus! Paul says, God 'understands...and knows what is best for us at all times' (Ephesians 1:8 TLB). So instead of pestering Him to change things, thank Him for the lessons you're learning. And if you can't figure out what those lessons are take the advice of the Apostle James: 'If...you need wisdom...ask God' (James 1:5 CEV). 
Finally, when you're in a situation that creates more questions than answers, it takes faith to accept that 'in everything God works for the good of those who love him.' But over and over and again potentially wasted experiences will become confidence-builders and learning-accelerators if you let God into them! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'm still as strong today</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 14:10 NIV</span><br>When, at the Olympics in 1996, Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey ran the 100 metres in 9.84 seconds he broke the world record and was hailed as the world's fastest man. After his big win experts who critiqued videos of the race made an interesting discovery: Bailey never once lost momentum. In fact, he was still accelerating as he crossed the finish line - even though he was running at over 30 mph! 
Over the last couple of days we've looked at events from the book of Joshua. Well later on in that story we find out some amazing things about his best mate Caleb. Check this out: 'So here I am today, eighty-five years old! I'm still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.' (Joshua 14:10-14 NIV). Caleb was a guy who still had momentum when he was an old geezer - don't you want to be like that! It's clear that Caleb wasn't one of life's sprinters, his aim wasn't top speed, he wanted to go the distance. And that's exactly what he did by not allowing his strength to be sapped by taking pointless detours. Maybe he inspired the Apostle Paul hundreds of years later who wrote 'I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward' (Phil 3:14 NIV) ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Joshua ordered the officers of the people.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 1:10 NIV</span><br>There's more wisdom for us today in this story about the people of Israel entering the Promised Land. In verse 10 God says to Israel's leaders: 'Help your brothers' (Joshua 1:14 NIV). In this statement we see an early example of what we now know from the life of Jesus to be a lifestyle of serving. At the end of every day we should each ask ourselves, 'Who got what out of the choices I made today?' If the answer is 'I got lots, God got a bit and everybody else got zip' then you aren't on the path to leadership in the kingdom of God. Jesus put it like this, 'If you want to be great, you must be the servant of all the others.' (Mark 10:43 CEV).
Leadership boffin John Maxwell writes, '...live by these four simple words: add value to others. That philosophy will take you far. All talented people have a choice to make: to do their own thing and get all the credit or do the team thing and share it. My observation is that not only do talented people accomplish more when working with others but they are also more fulfilled than those who go it alone.' So here's the deal: you're only qualified to enjoy the perks of leadership when you're willing to embrace the principles of leadership, which means putting other people first. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Joshua ordered the officers of the people.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 1:10 NIV</span><br>Before Israel entered the Promised Land God gave two important instructions to its leaders:  1) 'Cross over ahead of your brothers' (Joshua 1:14 NIV). If God has called you to lead, stand up and get on with it. Believing in yourself and your mission will take you further than just working harder or even working smarter. All personal breakthroughs begin with a change in your beliefs. What you believe deep down determines what you expect, and what you expect determines how you will act. In the long run, a belief is more than just an idea you possess, it's an idea that possesses you!
2) 'Be strong and courageous' (Joshua 1:6). Your life will expand or shrink as a result of the courage you display. If you're willing to take risks you'll go further than those who follow the safe path. A great thinker in the twentieth century wrote: 'The moment you resolve to take hold of life with all your might and make the most of yourself at any cost, to sacrifice all lesser ambitions to your one great aim, to cut loose from everything that interferes with that aim... you set in motion the forces implanted within you for your own development. Live up to your resolve, work at what God meant you to work at for the perfecting of His plan, and you will be invincible. No power on earth can hold you back...']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>the tongue is a flame of fire.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 3:6 NLT</span><br>One day a girl visited her gran, the only person in the world she could really talk to. Gran always listened and gave the most amazing advice. The girl was upset because she'd been spreading rumours about all sorts of people in her class and had been found out. Nobody wanted to be her friend any more.  'How can I make things right?' she asked. Gran replied, 'Take that box of tissues and drop one on the doorstep of each person you've criticised.' The girl grabbed the box and ran out to do it. Later that afternoon she came back saying, 'Is that all?'   'No,' said Gran. 'Now go, pick up them all up and bring them back to me.' The next day, the girl returned to her gran's house, but without a single tissue: 'The wind blew them all away,' she said. After a long silence her gran said, 'That's how it is with words; they're easily spoken, but you can never take them back again.' It was a lesson that the girl never forgot.  
Words can cut deep scars on people's emotions. That's why God takes the sins of the tongue so seriously that He devotes an entire chapter of the Bible to the subject. Read James 3 and let it sink in to your heart. Remember, 'the tongue is a flame of fire' and you don't wanna get burnt! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I am sending you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 20:21 NIV</span><br>Gladys Aylward was just an ordinary young woman who did what she believed God called her to do. She'd read the Scripture, 'If you spend yourselves on behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed...The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs' (Isaiah 58:10-11 NIV). In 1930 she sailed to China where she opened a home for orphaned children who'd been left to starve or wander the streets. She devoted her life to becoming a mother to each of them. When the Japanese invaded China in 1938 Gladys was forced to flee to the mountains with over 100 children to care for. Through an epic journey of extreme difficulty and danger she brought the children to safety. Years later when she was publicly honoured, she explained her amazing work like this: 'I did not choose this. I was led into it by God.'
Jesus said, 'As the Father has sent me, I am sending you' (John 20:21 NIV). The mission Jesus had while on earth, the mission Gladys got properly stuck into, is your mission too. William James said, 'The best use of life is to spend it for something that outlasts it.' Only the Kingdom of God is going to last; everything else will eventually fall apart. To fulfil your purpose here on earth is to have lived well. You wanna live well don't you?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>It's in Christ that we find out who we are.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:11 TM</span><br>One day a boy climbing in the mountains found an eagle's nest with an egg in it. He took it back to his dad's farm and put it under a hen along with her other eggs. When the eagle hatched it learned chicken behaviour and scratched around in the yard with the other little chicks. It didn't know any better. Sometimes it felt strange stirrings within itself but didn't know what to do with them, so it just kept on acting like a chicken. Some months later a majestic adult eagle flew over the chicken yard and the eagle looked up and saw him. In that moment the chicken realised he wanted to be like that eagle, to fly high, to go to the mountain peaks he saw in the distance. As he spread his wings he suddenly understood that he was like that eagle. Though he'd never flown before, he possessed the instinct and capabilities. At first he flew unsteadily, then with greater power and control. Finally as he soared he knew he'd discovered his true self; the creature God made him to be.
This is what Paul had in mind when he wrote, 'It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for.' You were made by God and for God. Until you understand that, you won't discover your true self!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I came to give life...life in all its fullness.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 10:10  NCV</span><br>Just do it.  It's the real thing. I'm loving it!  We live in a world of straplines. But what was the original strapline? Well if you look in Genesis chapter 1 you might say, It's all good!  Sadly another strapline soon appears on the scene, You will be like God. This is the first lie ever recorded, it's the one the used by the serpent to con Eve into thinking her and her husband could make up their own set of rules to live by. And you know, he's still pushing the same line. You hear it in comments like: &quot;It's OK to do what you like as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.&quot; But we all know that in reality the kind of actions that flow from that mindset do end up hurting people - mostly the people who are living by that strapline. And what about the classic &quot;Try anything once.&quot; Well where is a statement like that gonna get you? OK, if your parents wrapped you up in cotton wool for the first 15 years of your life maybe you're feeling like you wanna live a bit but does that mean &quot;Anything goes?&quot; It's not rocket science to work out where you'll end up with that life strapline. 
So if you really want a strapline for life why not try this one for size, 'I came to give life?life in all its fullness'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Follow me, and I will make you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 4:19  KJV</span><br>Jesus doesn't invite us to follow Him because we believe in Him. He invites us to follow Him because He believes in us! He says, 'Follow me and I will make you...' He knows what we can become when His grace touches our lives. Matthew, a Jew, collected taxes for the Romans who enslaved his people. That made him a double-crosser and a back-stabber, in other words he was lower than scum. Even so, Jesus knew there was potential for goodness and greatness in him. Years later Matthew would end up writing the first book in the New Testament. And if you know anything about the bible you'll know that this selection wasn't a one-off, Jesus had a habit of choosing the sort of people everyone else would leave on the sub bench. 
One of the mad things about the 12 guys Jesus chose to be his 'inner circle' is that after three years of being around His miracles and messages, some still had questions and doubts. But did he give up on them? No, he just shared with them this prayer, 'I will ask the Father to send you the Holy Spirit who will help you and always be with you' (John 14:16 CEV). He knew there would never be a day when they wouldn't need heaven's help. The amazing thing is that the prayer he prayed includes you too - yes you - Jesus believes in you! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>That by his death he might...free those who...were held in slavery by their fear of death.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 2:14-15 NIV</span><br>If you live life by your own set of rules you'd better be ready for the consequences. The what? Consequences. It's a word you won't hear very much on T4. What it means is that if you choose to act in a certain way then certain things are gonna happen as a result. If you go out and get drunk then you'll wake up in the morning with a banging head - or worse! The thing about being young is that many of the choices you make now don't seem to have any consequences - you're invincible! WRONG. You're just storing up all kinds of problems that will catch you up in years to come. Living the Jesus way ensures that you are storing up only blessings, not consequences, for the future. 
The original and ultimate consequence is death. This has been the case ever since the first humans chose to turn their backs on God and live life their way instead. Because of this loads of people live in fear that death is the end and there is no way to escape it. The Bible breaks this fear when it describes what Jesus achieved for us on the cross: 'Only by dying could he break ...the power of death...[and] set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying' (Hebrews 2:14-15 NLT). So live the Jesus way today - live fear free.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Forgiving one another...as God...has forgiven you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:32 NLT</span><br>What's the worst thing you've ever done? Did you get caught? Well imagine if whatever it was you did was tattooed on your forehead for everyone to see. Not nice thoughts are they... quick, let's do some happy imagining instead! Well imagine you're walking down the busy high street in your hometown, and everyone's giving you evil looks and tut-tutting. Suddenly, a guy steps out in front of you and looks you right in the eye. He has the strangest expression on his face - it's not the judgemental look everyone else gives you - it's sort of, a smile. He breaks your stunned silence with a few softly spoken words, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;  &quot;Please, I want it to be gone,&quot; you reply shakily. He reaches into one of his  deep coat pockets and pulls out a little make-up mirror and holds it up to your face. The writing's disappeared! How do you feel now? 
That story isn't about God being soft on sin. His love won't let you off - but His love won't let you go either.  'Nothing can separate us from the love of God' (Romans 8:38-39). As soon as you admit your issues to Jesus and express to him how much you truly want to change he just goes right ahead and hits the delete button on all that stuff. It's called forgiveness and it's the best thing in the whole world!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The joy of the Lord is your strength'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Nehemiah 8:10</span><br>Prisons in Bible times were miserable places - especially if you'd just taken a beating before being thrown inside. Amazingly though, 'Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, while the other prisoners listened.' When you're down and depressed there is no way your emotions want to praise God so like these guys you have to make a faith-decision to do it anyway - soon enough your feelings will have to come in line because faith is stronger than emotion. 'Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the jail to its foundations. The doors opened, and the chains fell from all the prisoners.' (Acts 16:25-26 CEV). Just like the story of the Old Testament king yesterday it was the praise that led to the breakthrough! And it can happen for you too. If you want to shake things up, see doors open and chains break, begin to praise God in the face of all the kak life throws your way! This sort of praise isn't about sweet ballads to a gently strummed guitar. It's a screaming electric feedback connection amplified between the airwaves of earth and heaven. It's a broadband channel through which God blasts in to save your situation from the inside out. 
So if you're feeling tired and battered today make a faith-decision based on what Nehemiah says, 'The joy of the Lord is your strength' (Nehemiah 8:10). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>As soon as they began singing, the LORD confused the enemy camp.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Chronicles 20:22 CEV</span><br>There's no law that says praising God is reserved for church on Sunday. Worship is a lifestyle: at work, at school, at home, in the shower... anywhere you can imagine! Praise (telling God how great he is) brings God's reality right into our situation. The guy who wrote all those Psalms that wedge in the middle of your bible said, 'I bless God every chance I get; my lungs expand with his praise' (Psalm 34:1 TM). Praise is an expression of faith; it's a declaration that God's in control. If we rewind back to the Old Testament there's a story (in 2 Chronicles 20) about a king who sent a worship band to a battle in front of his army - was he bonkers? Maybe, but it worked! As they went forward praising God, 'the LORD confused the enemy camp? and the enemy was defeated. 
Here's another thing - praise isn't something you do just when you feel like it. The Bible says we're to 'offer to God a sacrifice of praise' (Hebrews 13:15 NIV). God's not daft - He knows the difference between songs sung on autopilot and the true adoration of a loving child. Anybody can praise God 'in the land that is plentiful' but the test is praising Him 'though I walk through the wilderness'. Matt Redman wrote a superb worship song all about that - but can you sing it and mean it?

<title><![CDATA[Get off the guilt train!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Those...in Christ...are not judged guilty.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:1 NCV</span><br>The Bible says, 'We all fall short of God's...standard' (Romans 3:23 NLT). Even the most amazing Christians you know struggle with weaknesses, some huge ones probably! We all screw up and mess up and generally do things every minute that we know we shouldn't. But if you live in a giant pit of guilt you're just punishing yourself which is not how you're supposed to be living! Becoming a Christian and giving your life to Jesus doesn't mean you become perfect. You will still blow it day after day. Even Paul, who had 'the desire to do...good,' admits that sometimes he couldn't 'carry it out' (Romans 7:18 NIV). 
The good news of the Gospel means that whenever you're 'in Christ... [you're] not judged guilty'. You do, however, need to say sorry and ask to be forgiven! This also means if you've got things to put right, you need to do that too. Sometimes saying sorry to God isn't enough, you have to say sorry to people and admit to them what you've been up to. But remember, this automatic forgiveness deal is not an excuse to sin. Your folks will forgive you for most things but is this a reason to steal out of your mum's purse? Because she will forgive you? Of course not. We do our best out of love. Grace is there for when our best just isn't good enough.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>One of you says, &quot;I follow Paul&quot;; another, &quot;I follow Apollos&quot;; another, &quot;I follow Cephas &quot;; still another, &quot;I follow Christ.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 1:12 NIV</span><br>Back in the early church Paul had to tackle an issue with people saying they were following different leaders. While the point is that everyone should have been following Jesus, it's interesting to look at these different leaders. You see Paul was a strange chap. He would have looked pretty ugly due to all his beatings and was a pretty dull preacher (one guy fell asleep during a sermon, fell out the window and died!) but he wrote cracking letters and did some seriously crazy stuff! Apollos on the other hand was a real clever guy who was known to preach a fantastic sermon. Cephas (Peter), would have been everyone's friend. We can see from some of the daft things he said to Jesus he was probably funny to be around and would've been life and soul of the party; a loving, friendly, fun bloke who everyone wanted to be mates with. These three guys would have been completely different in looks, age, and most importantly personality type. Many people look at big leaders and think 'they're so different to me; I could never be like that'. But listen, personality type has nothing to do with it! Paul, Apollos and Peter couldn't be more different but what they all had in common was a passionate love for Jesus, desperation to be used and the guts to stand up and make their life count. That's what you need too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>My co-workers in the ministry.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 16:3 NLT</span><br>God works with people who know how to work with people! Using people, especially nice people, is way too easy to do. Lots of people find themselves being totally overworked and underpaid in their jobs and others just feel a bit used by even their friends at times. We could all argue that we're being used all the time; 'she's just using me for someone to go shopping with', or 'he's just using me to talk to'. Make sure that you value people and don't just use them. Paul dedicates an entire chapter to people he valued: 'Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in the ministry...In fact, they once risked their lives for me. I am thankful to them, and so are all the Gentile churches...Greet my dear friend Epenetus. He was the first person from the province of Asia to become a follower of Christ. Give my greetings to Mary, who has worked so hard for your benefit. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews, who were in prison with me. They are highly respected among the apostles and became followers of Christ before I did. Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. Greet Apellas, a good man whom Christ approves...and all the believers who meet with them' (Romans 16:3-15 NLT). Bottom line; open up, reach out, sharpen your people skills!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We rebuilt the wall.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 4:6 NIV</span><br>When Nehemiah talks about himself, he talks openly and honestly about crying over the ruins of Jerusalem, praying, and the days when he wondered how he'd survive. But when his dream of re-building the wall of Jerusalem happened in a record 52 days, he gives the credit to others. 'We rebuilt the wall...for the people worked with all their heart.' There's no limit to what can be done when nobody cares who gets the credit.
U2 front man Bono has become a world leader in speaking up for the helpless and poor. Bono has learned that to make any difference, you have to partner with others. He has met with heads of state, economists, industry leaders, celebrities; anyone who has the potential to help the people he's trying to reach. Rock stars are usually seen as self-absorbed, isolated, and indifferent to others. It's the reason many music groups don't stay together. Bono comments: '...people are so lost in themselves and the demands of their own life, that it's very hard to be in a band...people want to be lords of their own domain. I mean, everybody, as they get older...rids the room of argument. You see it in your family, you see it with your friends. They get a smaller and smaller circle of people around them who agree with them. And life ends up with a dull sweetness.' Learn to work with others.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The burden is too heavy for me.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 11:14 NIV</span><br>Working with other people can be a real blessing, or it can be an absolute pain in the neck! We're all made differently and we each have personalities that are as different as the colours in a kiddies' crayon set. Some colours will work beautifully together and some will just clash horribly. When we're supposed to work closely with a colour that just doesn't go, your first instinct is to run away, refuse to do it, and to be horrible to them. Maybe it's a kid at school you have to do a project with, or the know-it-all at work you just can't stand. The annoying thing is that you can't do everything yourself. As great as you think you are, it's guaranteed that the other person or people can bring something that you're missing. What you need is the grace and patience to find it! 
Working with others will make you so much stronger than trying to get the glory and do it all alone, even when they're O so annoying! Imagine a rainbow. It goes right through the spectrum of colours, yet the colours don't clash, it's beautiful! Every one is equal, included and has something to bring and the result is spectacular. So if you have a clash today, pray for grace and ask God to help you figure out their true colour.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>And we... are bring transformed into His likeness...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:18</span><br>Ever thought about what kind of guy Jesus was? We have our 'flowing dress and golden hair' view of course but what do you think He was actually like? We know He wasn't very tall (men weren't at that time) and wasn't very fit (Bible says people didn't like him for his looks), but something about Him meant that He could say to people 'follow me' and they dropped everything and did! Jesus was no wuss. He was scared of no one and had a sack full of killer putdowns for the bunch of guys were always trying to find a reason to kill Him. He always had loads of mates so He was probably quite a laugh yet He loved everyone, so must have had a really weird gentle side too. He didn't care what anyone thought of Him, only what God thought and never did anything just for the sake of popularity. 
When we look at Jesus we can see what God is like because He was God's Son. But more importantly we can see what we can be like, because He was also Mary's Son and very human. It's scary to think we could be like Jesus, most of us couldn't feel farther from it yet every time we're challenged by God He is changing us to be more like Jesus. Up for the challenge?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>It begins and ends with faith...those who are right with God...live by faith.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 1:17 NCV</span><br>Some people worry about the strangest things. A man who claimed he'd swallowed a horse was sent to a psychiatrist who recommended having an operation for the removal of the horse. The surgeon agreed to bring a horse into the operating room so that when the man woke up he'd know the operation was a success. But after the operation the man opened his eyes and announced, 'That's the wrong horse. It's white. The one I swallowed was black!' Too much worry and not enough reality; it's why Jesus had loads to say about worry. Understand this. Worry: a) wastes your time and energy. Jesus said, 'Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?' (Matthew 6:27 NIV). It's a medically proven fact that worry can shorten your life b) stops you from enjoying what you have. You worry about things you should be trusting God with cc) makes you forget God's promises. 'If God didn't hesitate to put everything on the line...by sending his...Son, is there anything else he wouldn't...do for us?' (Romans 8:32 TM). God knows your needs and your problems, so don't just ignore them hoping they will go away, but also don't worry. There's a healthy balance that involves seeing the concerns and giving them carefully to God. So today stop worrying and trust God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let's walk right up to him and get what he is so ready to give.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 4:16 TM</span><br>Are you finding prayer hard work? Maybe you're not really hearing from God or you're just not 'feeling it'. Maybe God doesn't seem to be answering your prayers at all so it all just seems a bit pointless. NEWSFLASH: It's not about you! God is not Santa, a jolly chap waiting to give you everything you ask as long as you've been good. God is the great I Am, Jesus died a gruesome death, for you! He is worthy of all your praise, your time, your prayer, everything you can give Him whether you feel the tingle or not! 
At the same time, God is loving and does actually want to have a relationship with you. This means that when you come to Him He does listen and He does want to draw close to you. If your prayer times involve a lot of mind-wandering and sleeping, try focusing on God, not yourself. Worship Him, praise Him, and refuse to let go. He wants to take you right into His throne-room (that's the room where He's on His throne!) and once you're in God's presence like that, you won't be falling asleep! It's there that you will learn God's voice and understand who it is you're dealing with. God wants to bless you, He also wants to challenge, shape and transform you. This is going to be hard and takes discipline, but it's so worth it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Rooted deep...and founded securely on [God's] love.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:17 AMP</span><br>Many things can make us feel rejected, even when we're not really! It may be a friend that's gone off with someone else, a relationship that's just ended or even a parent that you've convinced yourself doesn't want you. The truth is that it's unlikely that any of these are actually down to someone rejecting you. It may be that in the long run God is actually saving and protecting you from a bad relationship or if it's your parent, there's guaranteed to be a whole load of stuff going on; none of which is that they just don't want you! If your roots are securely in God, the rejections we face all around us can't affect us in the same way. If you know you're 100% loved, welcomed, wanted and cared for by the Almighty Creator of the Universe, does it really matter that you didn't get picked for the footie team? 
As humans we love self-pity. It's almost fun and comforting to wallow and feel sorry for ourselves. We want others to wallow with us, say nice things and get drawn into a slanging match about people we don't like. This is bad! This is a time to dig your roots in deep, look over your own pain to the truth of the situation and what God thinks about it, and you. Don't get caught up in self-pity!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 SAMUEL 5:7 NKJV</span><br>In 1000 BC David had a look at Jerusalem. It was a monster of a fortress (think of Helmsdeep in Lord of the Rings) and the old enemy were so cocky they even shouted 'You'll never get in here...Even the blind and lame could keep you out!' (2 Samuel 5:6 NLT). The walls were high and situation looked hopeless but did that stop David? Not in the slightest. The Bible says 'Nevertheless David took the stronghold...dwelt in [it]...and called it the City of David.'
We all have areas of our life where the fight just looks too hopeless - the walls are too big and we're so small! Satan tells us we can't do it and we believe him. It might be that habit you just can't quit, the attitude you can't shake, the way you feel every single time you look in that mirror... we just don't feel good enough. But, your battles (which in the Bible are called strongholds) mean nothing to God. When the enemy says, 'You're stuck, you'll never get out,' the Bible says His 'mighty weapons...knock down the devil's strongholds' (2 Corinthians 10:4 TLB). To be like David you must do two things. Listen to the right voice; the one telling you it is possible to win and look for solutions. David won because he didn't stare at the walls, he looked for the tunnels.

<title><![CDATA[The cure for loneliness]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Turn to me and be gracious...for I am lonely.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 25:16 NIV</span><br>One of the most awful feelings in life is that of loneliness. No matter who you are, where you live or even how many friends you have, everyone goes through times of feeling lonely. Sometimes there is a good reason and but other times there's no reason, you just do. 
Jesus knew what it was to feel lonely. Imagine going through life with the closeness of God as your Father, only to be abandoned as you hang on the cross; the time when you need Him most. In those moments Jesus knew what it was to feel totally abandoned and it was probably the loneliest moment anyone has ever endured; after all, even in our loneliest times God has never left our side. It doesn't always feel like it and you can't always see it at the time but looking back it's obvious. These times are some of the easiest for sin to creep in, a little peek at dodgy web sites or to drown your sorrows with a few sneaky drinks. Satan will tell you that these sorts of things will bring you comfort, make you feel better, or even that you deserve a little pleasure! But it's all lies. These are the times you need to draw closest to God. He's promised to never leave or abandon you and the lonely times can be where your strength comes from.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Those who remain in me and I in them, will bear much fruit.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:5 NLT</span><br>Why is it, that even when we know what's best for us, we just don't do it? Just above the Himalayan mountains in Tibet there are miles of barren wasteland. There's nothing on this wasteland. It's brown, dry, dusty, and flat with no features, no plants, no rainfall, no rocks, not even the odd bit of anything to make it interesting. Nothing lives there, apart from the Wild Ass. Every day these donkeys trek miles and miles to an oasis, a beautiful lake of fresh crystal blue water surrounded by green grass and plants. They spend a few hours grazing here, eating, drinking, before wandering back to the baron, brown nothingness. Scientists have been baffled for years. Why don't these stupid donkeys just live at the oasis? There appears to be no reason for it, they just live in the dust, always have done, always will do. 
As dumb as these animals sound, so often we do the same! We know God's goodness, we've tasted the life-giving water, we've sampled His amazing grace and His unending, unfailing love for us. We know how good it is to know Him, to speak to Him, to worship Him, yet time and time again we wander back to our miserable sinful lives. Why don't we just live at the oasis? Jesus said we should remain in Him so if you're in the dust today, get back to the oasis!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Honour one another above yourselves.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:10 NIV</span><br>Compromise is agreeing to change your viewpoint to meet someone else half way. It sounds awful, but it's not always bad. Obviously there are some issues that the Bible talks about that you can't compromise on (for example it's never OK to steal), but sometimes it's wise to compromise. Without compromise arguments can't be settled. If two people are both completely stubborn and refuse to budge on a subject, you just won't get anywhere! Compromising is not about being weak; in fact sometimes it takes more strength to agree to a compromise! For example, if mum wants you in at 9 and you think midnight is more reasonable, it probably wouldn't hurt either of you to agree to 10.30!  
Are we saying this is easy? Or free from risk? Or that it comes naturally? No. It's much easier (and safer) to stand your ground and believe that your way is the right way. But if you do that through life, you end up alone, bitter and angry that no one wants to listen to the person with all the answers! Don't be so proud that you can't see that maybe you're wrong. And if it's not an issue of right and wrong but of opinion, does it really matter so much that it's worth falling out over? No. Learn to understand when a bit of compromise is OK.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I can do everything through him who gives me strength.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILLIPPIANS 4:13 NIV</span><br>There's a story of a professor who stood before his class of 30 senior molecular biology students. Before the final exam he said, 'I have been privileged to be your instructor this semester, and I know how hard you have worked to prepare for this test. Because I am confident that you know this material, I am prepared to offer an automatic B to anyone who opts to skip taking the final exam.' A number of students jumped up from their desks, thanking the professor for the lifeline he had thrown them and they left. The teacher then handed out the final exam, which was just two sentences. It read: 'Congratulations, you have just received an A in this class. Keep believing in yourself.'
The Apostle Paul experienced more headaches and heartaches in a month than most of us will see in a lifetime. Yet he wrote, 'I can do everything through him who gives me strength.' Too many people are willing to settle for average. They have enough money to be comfortable, a nice partner they can put up with, an easy church where they can just enjoy the service, chat with other comfortable friends and go home. With Christ in you not much is easy but anything is possible!  Why would you settle for a B when God can give you a seriously more exciting A?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 8:23 NIV</span><br>There are moments, especially as a young person when you have to make life-changing choices. One day Jesus invited two people to join His team, but they both had their reasons for putting it off. One had a funeral to attend, another wanted to go home to explain his decision. That's the last we hear of them. Matthew records, 'Then [Jesus] got into the boat and his disciples followed him.'  They had missed the boat!
You'll never get anywhere if you don't make decisions because you're scared or you can't decide or even because you can't be bothered. In the 1870s two men worked really hard on the idea of transmitting sound down a wire. Amazingly on exactly the same day both Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray planned to go to the patent office to file their idea. Unfortunately for Elisha Gray, despite the fact that he had the idea first, he was busy and sent someone in his place who got there an hour after Alexander Graham Bell. Alexander took credit for the invention of the telephone, and got very rich, and Elisha Gray missed out. If you get a God-given opportunity to do something, no matter how scary it is or how out of your depth you may feel, take it. Don't hang around, don't put it off, trust God and don't miss the boat!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>My servant Caleb has a different spirit.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 14:24 NIV</span><br>Caleb wasn't into 'safe living.' As a young man he came back from the Promised Land, stood with the minority and announced, 'With God on our side we'll take it!' At 85, he was still slaying giants and claiming mountains. That's because he had 'a different spirit'. Safe living is secure and straight forward but in many ways it's not really living, in fact it's quite dull! Most 'safe-livers' will look back in years and wish they'd gone for it, taken a risk and wondered what they could have done. When you're young, lots of people will tell you that you can't do all sorts of things. Maybe your IQ doesn't match your dreams or your skills don't quite match your passion. But so what? If God's called you or told you to do something, he'll give you the tools you need to do the job! Moses was given some huge jobs to do and most people would have said he was insane; he couldn't even speak properly! He went to do it anyway and God gave him Aaron to do the talking. If your mates or even your folks or church leaders tell you you're not good enough, see what God has to say. If God says yes then His opinion is the only one that counts. Would you rather try and fail, or not try at all?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Walk...With all lowliness and meekness.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:1-2 </span><br>When most of us think of what we would like to become, there's normally a real Catch 22. We dream of being loved, adored and famous on the outside but of course we're wise, humble and totally brilliant on the inside. To get loved, adored and famous we need to be wise, humble and brilliant first. But, if we get there then we probably won't want to be loved, adored and famous 'cos we'll know what we're really like and what we deserve! Think carefully about the words 'walking with God.' Whose company are you in? God's! Can you think of a higher calling? Yet, the higher your calling, the lower you must become in your own eyes. That doesn't mean thinking you're rubbish, it simply means we need to understand just how amazing, mighty and awesome God really is. The more we see God for whom He really is, the more we realise we're so not God! When the apostle John saw Jesus standing in the midst of the seven churches, he wrote, 'And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead' (Revelation 1:17). Those who big up themselves are humbled by the Lord. Those who humble themselves before the Lord are the ones God raises up. Humility doesn't mean thinking less of yourself, it just means thinking of yourself less.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I have a great sense of obligation.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 1:14 NLT</span><br>Taking responsibility means giving back what was given to you. Reading this you may be thinking of all the things you have; a great family, a nice home, plenty to eat. On the other hand you may think of things you're missing; maybe a parent, enough money or a good church. The truth is if you're reading this as a Christian today, you have everything you need in Jesus. You've been saved from death, you're loved and you have a great hope and a future ahead of you. Everything you have comes from God, and still belongs to Him. When we try to keep what we have for ourselves, that's called being Self-serving. Self-serving people think of their talents and resources as something they own and try to keep these things for themselves. Serving people understand that all they have comes from God and that they have a responsibility to use it in the best way possible. If someone came and handed you a £50 note your first reaction would not be to say 'thank you' but 'what do you want me to do with it'? All we have comes from God but we often forget to even say thank you, let alone ask what we should do with it! Why not make a list of all you have; resources, skills, abilities and ask God today, 'what do you want me to do with it'?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Each of us will give an account of himself to God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 14:12 NIV</span><br>The newspaper editor sent a reporter to cover a sports game. He returned to the paper with no report. 'What's the story?' asked the editor. 'There is none,' replied the reporter. 'What? And why not?' 'Because there was no game,' replied the reporter. 'No game? What happened?' quizzed the editor. 'The stadium collapsed.' Unable to believe what he was hearing the editor asked, 'Then where's the report on its collapse?' After an awkward silence the reporter replied, 'That wasn't my assignment, sir.' Needless to say, that was the end of his career. 
The Bible says, 'Each of us will give an account of himself to God.' What does that mean? It means you have to pretty much explain yourself to the almighty creator of the universe! He's going to ask how you got on with the job he gave you and let's face it, any excuses you try to come up with that day are going to sound pretty lame!  
God has given you a great assignment, an important role in his plan for saving the world he loves so much. Are you going to be a wally like the reporter who gets to the end and has nothing to show? Or are you going to use your brain so when you give your account, you can be proud that you did the best you can do?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 4:2 NLT</span><br>If you want to be successful you have to take responsibility. Most people have big dreams of great things they'd like to achieve but sadly lots of people won't come close to achieving their dreams. Whether your dream is to run or own a business, become a doctor or lawyer, write great music, go into outer space or do one of another million great things, to achieve it you must take responsibility for your own life. Everyone has dreams; some people even have a plan to make their dreams happen. But unless you put the plan into action, your dreams will stay just that; dreams! You can think about them, write about them and even talk about them with everyone you meet, but if you're dream is to be a famous author, you better get writing! If you want to be an athlete, you better get training. Your dreams won't just happen when you reach a certain age. If you want to be at a certain place by the time you are 25, you had better start down that path now. Get some focus, be disciplined and understand the need to take responsibility. If you keep God right at the centre of all you want to do and don't get distracted with other things along the way then your dreams can become a reality. Why not ask God today to help you as you take responsibility for your future?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A man reaps what he sows.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:7 NIV</span><br>In 2002, Edward Brewer sued Providence Hospital for $2 million. He claimed that the hospital was negligent because it had not prevented him from raping one of its patients. We live in such a bizarre blame culture that in this case it wasn't even the female rape victim blaming the hospital security for this awful incident, it was the rapist. Talk about not taking responsibility for your own actions! Fortunately in this case the judge had a bit more sense and ruled that any damage Brewer suffered due to his crime was his own responsibility not the hospitals fault! 
Although it seems crazy, this is an extreme example of what we can do everyday. If we break something we claim the item wasn't strong enough, we burn something and blame the cooking time on the packet. Late for school? Bus's fault. Forgot homework? Mum's fault for not waking you up in time. News flash: Being young does not give you the right to blame everyone else for everything. If your uniform isn't clean, clean it. Phone credit's run out? Stop texting nonsense. Late for school? Set an alarm and stop relying on people to drag you out of bed. There comes a point when you can't keep blaming other people and that point is not when you've grown up or when you're a parent, it's right now.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Much is required from those to whom much is given.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 12:48 TLB</span><br>Responsibility is a word many of us don't like. When you're young, free and single often the last thing you want is a bunch of stuff you HAVE to do, places you HAVE to go and things you HAVE to face up to. You want to do WHAT you want, go Where you want and not have to give a second thought to anyone else! But guess what, life's not like that. Like it or not, you do have responsibilities. You're responsible for your own behaviour, for your language, for your school work, for making the right decisions, for the way you treat people, and that's just a few examples! When you have responsibilities, all the excuses in the world won't let you off the hook. You can blame others and shout and get mad and refuse to accept responsibility all you want, it won't make the smallest difference. 
Your problem isn't your friends, or your job, or your girlfriend, or your parents or even the government!. Be honest, your biggest challenge in life is you. You may feel hard done by or picked on but if your life's not going the way you want it to, you are responsible for changing it, and God will help you if you turn to Him. But you must want to change, decide to change, and work each day toward that end.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 3:9 NIV</span><br>God had big plans for Sam, he would become a great priest who would hear from God and help the Jews understand how to live as God's people. But right now Sam is a young lad, and he hears someone calling his name so He thinks it's the old priest, his boss, Eli shouting out for some help.
The Bible says: Eli said, 'Son, I didn't call you. Go back to bed' (1 Samuel 3:7). This all happened before Samuel knew God for himself. It was before the revelation of God had been given to him personally. After this happens a few times, Eli cottons on and tells Sam to keep listening to the voice, because it's God Himself who is trying to get Sam's attention.  Next time Sam was ready to listen and do whatever God said. 
Jesus said: 'My sheep listen to my voice; I know them and they follow me'. He also said 'The sheep follow him because they know his voice (John 10). 
Learning to recognize God's voice doesn't just happen overnight, because He speaks to us at different times, in different settings and in different ways. Through the Bible, a talk, a mate, a dream...be ready to hear from Him.  He wants YOU to know Him personally, to know Him for yourself. Oh yeah, when you hear Him get ready to obey!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>His Spirit in your inner being.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:16</span><br>You've seen the Ads on TV, 'Because you're worth it', 'The Lynx effect', and all that. These kinds of companies spend billions trying to get us to decorate a shell that's in a losing battle with Mother Nature and Father Time, and we can fall for it too. In our rush to create what we think will attract others, we spray, we squirt, we dye, we gel, we wax and maybe succeed in turning a head or two, but it has zero ability to win a heart or mind. No amount of diets or press-ups will help, and neither will being seen in the right place with the right people. If you want to earn people's trust, respect, and real friendship you'll have to start sorting out the inside not the outside. That's not an excuse to totally let go! It's important to look after the body God gave you, but when you become obsessed with your 'looks' alone, you become shallow and superficial. Others will quickly lose interest because they discover that although the box you came in is beautifully wrapped it's empty! The only real appeal we have is 'His Spirit in your inner being'; illumination on the inside, buzzing in your body, fizzing in your physique. 
That's what ultimately wins hearts and attracts the right people to you, for the right purpose, at the right time.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When I am afraid, I will trust in you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 56:3 NIV</span><br>There's a company called 'NO FEAR' that makes a packet selling T-shirts to people who are into dangerous sports; or people who are trying to pretend they're into dangerous sports! Well we all know that just getting out of bed in the morning can be a risky business (especially if you're on the top bunk) so how do we live and enjoy our lives fully without being a prisoner to fear? In one of his poems David said, 'When I am afraid I put my trust in you'.
Some people want a cast iron guarantee that everything will go according to plan, before they step out to do anything new. More often than not progress involves risk; and often risk involves fear and fear distorts your view of God. It tells you you're not in safe hands; that He's not big enough to take care of you. DON'T LISTEN! You need to walk through your fears to discover what God has for you on the other side? If you give in to fear now you'll just end up in a comfy chair vegging in front of your telly wondering, 'What could have happened, if only I'd trusted God more?' 
ONE MORE TIME; 'When I am afraid I put my trust in you'. So get moving! Don't let the voice of fear rob you of your destiny!!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 20:29 (NIV)</span><br>We read about Jesus in the Bible but because we've never seen Him here on earth our minds can play tricks on us or our mates can make fun of us saying, 'Doh! You think Jesus is alive?!? You think the Hoooly Spirit talks to you?!?'  Well, think about this for a minute before you give in to that stuff 'how much of this life is actually made up of things you can see?' Think about it. Where are your friends right now? Can you see them? Do you start to doubt that they exist when you can't see them? When your mum shouts from the bottom of the stairs that your tea's ready do you get all spooked and start thinking that you're hearing voices in your head just because you can't see her but you can hear her voice? Don't be daft! Then there is the air you are breathing right now or what about the feelings you have, and the memories; all that's invisible but it makes up a massive chunk of your life. Faith is when you believe in the stuff that you can't see, and the Bible says it's impossible to please God without faith. So just because you've not seen Jesus you're not at a disadvantage; Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed'. He loves it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The greatest among you will be your servant.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 23:11 NIV</span><br>We are used to hearing about celebs who turn up with 'their people'. Security, stylists, PR guys, assistants. The bigger the entourage, the bigger the celeb. 
Lots of people dream of 'making it' and most of the dreams would include servants and staff running around at their beck and call. 
So what does Jesus mean when he says 'The greatest among you will be your servant'; didn't He mean the greatest among will have servants? Nope, check out the verse again in The Message translation 'Do you want to stand out? Then step down. Be a servant. If you puff yourself up, you'll get the wind knocked out of you. But if you're content to simply be yourself, your life will count for plenty.'  Remember how Jesus introduced Himself? 'The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life' (Mark 10:45 NIV), and He practiced what He preached. Jesus is God; if anyone should get VIP treatment it was Him, yet we read about Him washing the disciples' mucky feet. That's like the star striker cleaning the B team's boots. So who you can you serve today? You might not have to untie their trainers or get a flannel out but how could YOU put others first? Do you want to stand out? Then step down; BE A SERVANT

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Lord...redeems your life from destruction.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 103:2-4 NKJV</span><br>On a winter afternoon Harry de Leyer returned from an auction with a big grey horse that his children promptly named Snowman. He was a good riding horse, but when a neighbour offered Harry twice what he'd paid for him, he agreed. Right away he regretted his decision; so apparently did Snowman. And that's when his hidden talent was revealed! The neighbour's fences were high, but Snowman repeatedly jumped them to be with the master and family he loved. Finally Harry bought the horse back and the rest is history. Snowman kept winning championships and shows and was named 'Horse of the Year' two years running. But not because he was a good runner but was an awesome jumper. Nobody would ever have known had it not been for the fences that separated the grateful animal from his loving master. Of course unknown to the champion horse, Harry had arrived late at the auction that day after the best horses were sold. Snowman was rescued from the only other bidder...a man who intended him for the glue factory!  'The Lord... redeems your life from destruction.'  The word redeem means bought for a price and collected. God rescued you but unlike Harry, God rescued you knowing what you can become. God knows that you were heading for destruction but now can be a champion. God knows; but do you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Give, and it shall be given unto you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:38</span><br>Legend has it that a man was lost in the desert, dying for water. He came upon a shack and saw a rusty old water pump. He began to pump up and down. But nothing came out. Then he noticed a nearby jug with these words, 'My friend, you have to prime the pump with the water in this jug. PS fill the jug again before you leave.'  Now he was faced with a decision. If he drank the water in the jug he could live. But if he poured it into the old rusty pump it could make it work, giving him loads of fresh water. Reluctantly he poured all the water into the pump. Then he grabbed the handle and began to pump...squeak, squeak, squeak. Nothing came out! Squeak, squeak, squeak. A little bit began to dribble out, then a small stream, and finally it gushed! To his relief fresh, cool water poured out of the old rusty pump. Eagerly, two times he filled the jug and knocked back great mouthfuls of water. Then he filled the jug for the next traveller. He filled it to the top, popped the cork back on, and added this little note: 'Believe me, it really work!.' If you're generous not greedy, giving not grabbing; you could wonder 'what if I miss out?' Jesus said 'Give, and it shall be given unto you.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Son you are always with me and everything that I have it yours.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 15:31 NIV</span><br>This is one of Jesus' most famous stories. We can all identify with it; growing up, wanting to be your own person, a bit of independence. Then the realisation that when the fun inevitably comes to an end, is anybody really there for you?
In this story Jesus is saying a big fat 'yes'. God, the No One true dad, is there for all who want to come back home to Him with a party waiting to happen. But the story has a twist; big brother wasn't about to celebrate little brother's return. Listen to him: 'Did you ever, ever throw party for me and my mates? No! But when this waster comes crawling back, oh yes, he gets the full treatment. Well thanks for nothing!' (Luke 15: 29-30 STREET).
When you're jealous you can't enjoy the party! Can you identify with that? Have you ever found yourself feeling like you deserve a bit of love and appreciation more than those who are getting it? Careful, jealousy is deadly. It leads to bitterness, which is a bizarre prison because only you can lock yourself in it. 
What's going on in your life right now? Maybe God is telling you to chill out. You're God's child and nothing can ever change that! Enjoy the party. There's space for you. Listen: God is saying, 'Child you are always with me and all I have is yours'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Continue in...the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 3:14-15 NKJV</span><br>Three reasons to get into the Bible more: 
1) We'll understand it more! We hear someone preach a great sermon and think, 'When I read it I didn't see that!' That's because the pastor spends hours praying over it and studying the Scriptures! The more time we put in the Bible the more we can understand it! Ok so you've got stuff to do but what could you cut down on (school isn't an option!)?
2) We learn to hear God! It's easy to become satisfied with hearing ABOUT from somebody else rather than hearing FROM God ourselves. Sometimes we can miss out on the buzz of discovering great truths from God's Word unless we get stuck into His Word
3) It tastes good!  Bible study is hard work. There are no shortcuts to it. It takes time, effort, concentration and persistence. Most of its great truths don't lie on the surface; we have to dig for them. Dr Howard Hendricks describes the three stages of Bible study: a) the 'castor oil' stage; we study the Bible because we know it's good for us, but it's not too enjoyable b) the 'cereal' stage; our Bible study is dry and uninteresting, but we know it's nourishing c) the 'peaches and cream' stage; we are really feasting on the Word of God. Bottom line? 'Continue in...the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We become more like Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 NLT</span><br>Boffins say that the human mind is geared up to remember things in threes so we'll look at this really important subject at becoming more like Jesus one more time... You're young and you've got your life ahead of you, opportunities to do all sorts of cool things. What matters most is that whatever you do, you do it like Jesus would do it. 
Remember being like Jesus doesn't mean being a geek. Just don't become so well adjusted to your culture or fit into it so well that you can't un-fit yourself when you need to. So how do you do that? God uses His Word, people and circumstances, to bring out the best in us. God's Word provides the truth we need to know, God's people provide the support we need to grow and our circumstances provide the environment we need to show Christ's likeness. Make sure that you get into God's Word, connect with Christians regularly, and learn to trust God in every situation and you become more like Jesus; it's a guarantee. We all like to fit in, but fix your attention on God. He'll change you for the better, from the inside-out; unlike the world around you, changing you for the worst, from the outside-in. Check out this  promise: 'He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion' (Philippians  1:6).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We become more like Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 NLT</span><br>Eight times in the New Testament, we're told to 'make every effort' 2 B like JC. You don't just veg out on the sofa and wait for it to happen. Our mate the apostle Paul explains our three responsibilities in becoming like Christ: 
1) Changing our habits. Your character is made up of the sum of your daily habits. Listen: 'everything... connected with that old way of life has to go. It's rotten through and through. Get rid of it!' (Ephesians 4:22 TM)
2) Changing our thinking. The Greek word for transformed - metamorphosis - is used today to describe the amazing change a caterpillar goes through in becoming a butterfly and is a superb picture of what happens to us when we allow God to shape our thought life. As we spend time to chill with God, talking to him and reading his word, we take on the beauty of Christ's character; we leave behind those caterpillar limitations. Paul says 'be transformed by the renewing of your mind'  (Romans 12:2) 
3) Changing our clothes. God's word says, 'therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves...' (Colossians 3:12). Most people wouldn't go to a party in a school uniform; you need to dress yourself in the right gear to make the most of the moment. So in life put on the right things '...clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility and patience.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We become more like Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 NLT</span><br>Becoming like Jesus Christ isn't like Evan Almighty! You won't start growing a beard (good news, eh girls!) but you will grow character. Magazines and TV programmes talk a lot about changing your style, your waistline and even your bra size but they never say anything about transforming your character, even though it is your character that enables you to make the most of life, long-term. 
Character, not comfort, is God's first priority in your life. If you get frustrated and start wondering 'why is all this happening to me', you need to remind yourself that living life to the max isn't about avoiding extreme situations, it's growth in the midst of them, and victory over them. 
As how does character change happen?  'As the spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like him' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NLT). His spirit lives inside you and anything is possible! So then, don't sit on your backside until you feel capable or confident. Get up and in faith do the right things in spite of your fears. We choose to do the right thing and then trust God's spirit to give us the oomph, the passion, the faith, and the brains to do it. That's how you co-operate with the Holy Spirit. That's how 2 B like JC and see true character developed in you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Whoever learns from correction is wise.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 15:5 NLT</span><br>There are two kinds of criticism: 
1) criticism we don't deserve. One day Henry Ward Beecher stood up to preach. He noticed that someone had left on the pulpit some paper with the word 'fool' written on it. He knew someone was having a go at him. He lifted the paper for all to see, then he announced, 'Generally I receive letters from people who write and forget to sign their name. This letter is different. The person has signed his name but forgotten to write the letter.' Jesus said, 'Offences will come' (Luke 17:1). So expect them. You're getting noticed. You're making a difference. So when you are criticized unjustly, forget it and move on. Jesus did! 
2) Justified criticism. Criticism that's justified is the kind with a measure of truth in it. An old Arabian proverb goes like this, 'If one person calls you a donkey, forget it. But if five people call you a donkey, buy a saddle.' Dr James G Kerr, a management psychologist, points out that we don't grow or learn about ourselves if we don't listen to anything about ourselves that isn't flattering. Stop hiding from the truth. Every one of us can improve what we're doing and the way in which it's being done. As they say, 'The largest room in the world is room for improvement!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>One generation will commend your works to another.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 145:4</span><br>One day a Scottish farmer called Mr Fleming saved the life of a nobleman's son who was sinking in a muddy bog. The next day the boy's father visited the farm and offered to repay him, but the farmer wouldn't have it. Just then farmer Fleming's son came to the door and the nobleman said, 'Then let me pay to educate your boy to the same standard as mine, and if he turns out to be half the man his father is, we'll both be proud' Fleming agreed and his son attended the best schools, eventually graduating from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London. You've probably never heard of farmer Fleming, but I bet you've heard of his son. Sir Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered the miracle drug, Penicillin, saving gazillions of lives. And check this, years later when the same nobleman's son developed pneumonia, guess what saved his life? Penicillin! And what was this nobleman's name? Lord Randolph Churchill. And his son's name? Sir Winston Churchill, who helped save Europe from the horrors of Hitler! That's mad isn't it?! We don't know how much God was involved in engineering those events but we know this: God has connected our life and destiny with many other people around us. The whole of the Bible tells of the chain reactions that happen when people follow through with the connections He makes for them. Who's life can you affect today? Could you start a chain reaction?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Encourage one another.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:11 NIV</span><br>Pastor Chuck Swindoll writes: 'The ski slopes were in perfect condition. I struck out on my first attempt at skiing with a positive attitude, thinking, &quot;I'm going to be the first person who learns to ski without falling down&quot;.  It's doubtful anyone ever came down a ski slope more ways, or landed in more positions, or did more creative things in the air before landing. Working with me that humiliating day was the world's most encouraging ski instructor. Never once did she lose her cool, or laugh at me, or say &quot;You are absolutely impossible. I quit!&quot; That dear, gracious lady helped me up more times than I can number. She repeated the same basics time and again; like she had never said them before. Even though I was colder than an explorer in the Antarctic, irritable, impatient, and under the snow more than I was on it, she kept offering words of reassurance. That day God gave me a never-to-be-forgotten illustration of the value of encouragement...What is true for a novice on the snow once a year is all the more true for people we meet every day. Harassed by demands and deadlines; bruised by worry, adversity and failure; broken by disillusionment and defeated by sin, they live somewhere between dull discouragement and sheer panic. All of us need encouragement, and the beautiful part about encouragement is this: anybody can do it!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>EVERY ONE OF US WILL GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF TO GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 14:12</span><br>You have to be up for a dare if you're going to follow God. That doesn't mean that He wants you to join your local bungee jumping club but He may direct you to do things that people around you don't understand or agree with. Insecure people tend to feel safer doing what others do; they are fearful of breaking the mould or standing alone. Anytime you step outside of the boundaries of what others think is cool or normal, you risk rejection, but you can't allow that to keep you from fulfilling your God-given purpose. 
Confronting criticism becomes a little easier when you remember that ultimately 'everyone of us shall give an account of himself to God'.  Yeah, it stings when you're criticised, but if you're to succeed at anything you must have the same attitude that Paul had. Listen: 'I care very little if I am judged by you... it is the Lord who judges me' (1 Corinthians 4:3-4 NIV). Secure people can handle being the only ones who dare to do something - not in a showing-off kind of way, and not just being random and stupid out of total boredom - but daring to live a radically different life - like the Jesus we follow. Be a revolutionary!  For ideas of how to dare to live in a way that makes a difference check out www.hope-revolution.com

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are those who believe without seeing.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 20:29 NLT</span><br>Asking for proof before you believe something, can stop you from receiving what God wants you to accept based on His Word. Thomas watched Jesus die. That's a tough image to forget. He was majorly shook up. When your faith has been shaken, you tend to cling to things that are basic, close and reliable. Stories of ghosts didn't fit in that category. But Jesus was gracious to Thomas and allowed him to touch his risen body saying, 'You believe because you have seen...Blessed are those who believe without seeing.' Thomas' problem wasn't lack of faith, it was misdirected faith. He trusted only what he could process on a human level. Sound familiar?
By contrast, when Mary Magdalene met Jesus at the tomb He told her, 'Don't touch me...But go find my brothers and tell them' (John 20:17 TLB). Mary was in an emotional state and just wanted a hug from the faithful friend she thought she'd lost forever. But Jesus needed her to start trusting His Word and not His flesh. Sometimes we feel 'the touch of Jesus' calming us, strengthening us, reassuring us that He's in control. That touch has often kept us from giving up or going over the edge, but sometimes He asks us to simply trust Him at his word. That's faith at its highest level. So what's he saying to you today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I could ask my Father for thousands of angels...and he would send them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 26:53 TLB</span><br>Isn't it just bizarre how the cross has become a fashion accessory? After all, nobody would wear an electric chair ring, or a hangman's noose earrings! But even though a lot of people have forgotten what the cross means that doesn't mean it's lost its power. There will always be something uniquely special about the cross. And what better way to remember how much Jesus loves us. Beyond all the blood and the nails there is a simple shape, a horizontal beam showing how wide his love is, and a vertical beam showing how high and how deep his love is. John's gospel says, 'God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life. (John 3:16 NCV). It doesn't say God loved only the famous or the fabulous or then we'd all be in trouble.  No, if you live in 'the world' you're included by God!
Jesus didn't have to die, He chose to! He told His captors, 'I could ask my Father for thousands of angels...and he would send them instantly...' As Max Lucado says, 'The force behind the hammer wasn't an angry mob...the hand squeezing the handle wasn't a Roman infantryman...the verdict...wasn't decided by jealous Jews. Jesus himself chose the nails...' That's how much He loves you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God put his love on the line...while we were of no use whatever to him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 5:8 TM</span><br>We all know that war is a nasty business, and becoming a prisoner of war can be a death sentence. During the Second World War Ernest Gordon was captured by the Japanese army who forced their prisoners to work for them like slaves. One evening a guard noticed a shovel was missing. Insisting a prisoner had stolen it, he screamed for the guilty party to step forward. Then he prepared to kill them one by one until someone confessed. Suddenly a Scottish soldier spoke out and said, 'I did it.' The guard beat him to death on the spot. A few minutes later the shovels were re-counted. The guard was wrong. None was missing!
What kind of person would take the blame for something he didn't do? 'This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. (1 John 3:16 NIV). At the cross Jesus stepped out and offered himself as the punishment for our sins. Unlike the Scottish soldier in the story who was innocent, humankind was very definitely guilty. Unlike the Japanese Guard, God had a right to demand the ultimate penalty. So, having lived the life we couldn't live, Jesus took the punishment we couldn't escape. Now the question is: if He so loved us, can't we love each other?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 17:7 NIV </span><br>Samson was a heavy dude in the old days of Israel, a dread-locked hero who had amazing physical strength but a weakness for women. He kept the secret of his strength to himself, but eventually he got cocky and blabbed to his girl; bad move. Judges 16:19 says  'She called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair...and his strength left him'. The consequences for Samson were disastrous; he tried to fight like before but got absolutely battered. His ego had become bigger than his faith. He was no good to anyone. 
Jesus said 'Apart from me you can do nothing' (John 15:5). So be careful. Make sure you trust more in your bended knees than your metaphorical muscles (the stuff you are good at) 
'Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose confidence is in Him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit' (Jeremiah 17:5-8 NIV).
With God you are strong; without Him you are weak! Think about the things going on in your life and ask 'Should I flex my muscles or bend my knees and pray?'  You know the answer!

 Repent. When we start to spend time with God we quickly get a good idea of the attitudes, habits, selfish behaviour and lack of love that clutter our lives. It's important that we spend time asking God to forgive these sins but also to ask Him to help us turn away from them. Repentance is when we choose to change.
 Ask.  This is the easy part!  But sometimes we stop asking when we don't see quick answers. Don't give up. Prayer does have power. Sometimes you see the effects quickly- like switching on a light. Sometimes it takes longer- like a kettle.  Sometimes your prayers are changing you rather than your circumstances. Jesus had a story on prayer about a women who didn't give up asking . Have a read of Luke 18:1-8 
Yield This old fashion word just means give in, let go, allow God to do whatever he wants in your life. He's the boss! He is LORD

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:9</span><br>Praying is amazing. We can talk to the Creator of the universe just as if we've got a 'Hands Free Kit'. Jesus taught His friends to pray and He began by helping them to understand God in a way that was new for them; as a truly loving Dad, or in their language 'Abba'.
Author Max Lucado once visited Israel with his family. He had an awesome time and wrote about it in his book, 'One afternoon in old Jerusalem, I found myself behind  a Jewish family; a father and his three little girls. The 4-year-old fell a few steps behind and couldn't see him. &quot;Abba!&quot; she called. He stopped and immediately he extended his hand and she took it. He held her hand tightly as they descended the ramp. When they stopped at a busy street, she stepped off the curb and he pulled her back. When the signal changed he led her and her sisters through the busy road. In the middle of the street, he reached down, swept her up into his arms and continued their journey.'
Who'll take our hand when we're weak? Who'll guide us through the hectic streets of life? Who'll swing us up into His arms and carry us home? God, our loving Dad, our Abba. No matter what you're facing today just whisper, 'Abba,' and He'll be there for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I am watching over My word to perform it.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 1:12 NAS</span><br>Are you struggling with a habit so stubborn that it has a life of its own? Getting our heads round the promises in the Bible can make a big difference. 'I am watching over MY word to perform it' (Jeremiah 1:12.) In other words God says: 'trust me. I'm on it'. Sometimes the strength we need comes when we remind ourselves and God what He has said.   So begin each day by praying:
'Lord, the Bible says that if I call on You, You will answer me; You will be with me in trouble' (Psalm 91:15). You said that the power of the Holy Spirit deep inside me would set free from being endlessly caught up temptation, sin and failure (Romans 8:2). You said if I fully commit my life to You, I'd have the strength to stand up to the devil and he would flee from me (James 4:7). You said You've given me the power to deal with the wrong thoughts and ideas that peck my head (2 Corinthians 10:5). You said that my self-worth would be based solely on Your love for me; and that You would do immeasurably more than I could ask or think because You are at work in me (Ephesians 3:14-21). Today I thank You for helping me to overcome this habit. In Christ's name, amen.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[Stop allowing yourselves to be agitated...disturbed...and unsettled].</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:27 AMP</span><br>Picture it: Monday morning, the alarm doesn't go off. Skipping breakfast to try and make the bus, you see it pull off in the distance. As you start walking, the heavens explode, reducing your nice new hairdo to a wet squelch on your forehead. Passing cars race through puddles like Lewis Hamilton, drenching your crisp uniform and turning it muddy brown. You think about a snack from the local shop, but then realise your pennies are in your other pair of trousers at home; which means no money for dinner either. When you finally make it in, your teacher informs you that as this is your fifth late mark this month, you've collected the grand prize of Thursday night detention. What's your reaction: a) you pick up the nearest year 7 in the corridor and launch them like an Olympic winning javelin throw b) the vein in your neck pulsates, your fists clinch, your blood could boil potatoes, but you do nothing more than stew inside, or c) you go with the flow; you've learned how to control your reactions in stressful situations. 
OK, so anyone who answered C is a liar. But actually, that's what Jesus wants us to learn; to stop losing peace over every stress and strain, and to work on our reactions instead. Once you've mastered yourself, you're ready to master situations. Not easy stuff, but next time you miss that bus try it.
