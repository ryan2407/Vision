<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.’ John 13:8 NIV</p>
<p>Feet are generally a bit smelly. And in the first century AD, they were most certainly grotty. Imagine living in a town without slabs of concrete pavement to keep your feet from the dirt and grime beneath. Then imagine wearing only sandals, all day, every day. Dust, dung and dirt all got on people’s feet.</p>
<p>On the last night of His life, Jesus did a job that was normally done by the lowest rank of servants. It would have definitely been one of the worst jobs in the house. After His last dinner with the disciples, Jesus got down on His knees and washed their feet.</p>
<p>‘Why?’ you might ask. You wouldn’t be alone in wondering. The disciples must have been looking at each other with raised eyebrows, trying to figure out what was going on. Jesus said to them: ‘Do you understand what I have just done to you?... I, your Lord and Teacher, have just washed your feet. You, then, should wash one another’s feet.’ (John 13:12–14 GNT)</p>
<p>In other words, in order to serve God in a Jesus–like manner, we need to serve each other. Jesus made Himself the lowest by washing feet, so nothing should be seen as being beneath us when it comes to serving others.</p>

<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Imagine if the French had settled for an ‘Eiffel Chimney’. Or Michelangelo had just painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel a nice blue. Or Alexander Graham Bell had decided to just write a letter. The world would be a lot less colourful, wouldn’t it? These entrepreneurs didn’t throw in the towel the moment the headaches started. They saw the potential, pictured the dream and persevered with the vision. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>To keep your dream alive, you need to keep on dreaming. Don’t let the waiting fester into frustration. Don’t sell the dream short. Don’t settle for a bargain bin sort of hope. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>George Lucas had a vision to set new benchmarks for sci-fi movies. If the technology wasn’t there, he’d invent it. When the impossible started knocking on the door, he and his colleagues would return to the vision: ‘We were always dreaming of how it was going to be,’ he said. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>If he can keep believing in the name of <i>Star Wars</i>, surely you can keep believing in the name of Jesus. The Bible’s number one dream-boy, Joseph, didn’t let knockbacks steal his destiny. Disowned, trafficked, betrayed and left to rot in a dungeon… he still believed in his initial dream. Read Joseph’s waiting game in Genesis 37-45. Take note of the obstacles Joseph overcomes in order to see his dreams turn to reality. Guess what? You might have to do some <i>overcoming</i> too before your dreams turn into reality.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘Launch out into the deep.’ Luke 5:4 KJV</p>
<p>Heard the saying about someone ‘being a big fish in a little pond’? Well when it comes to goldfish it isn’t true. Goldfish grow to the size of the container they’re kept in. Put one in a small glass container and it’ll grow to about eight centimetres but if you put it in a huge lake it’ll grow anywhere up to a metre long! The size of the pond determines the size of the fish. Similarly, little ideas in little-thinking minds produce little achievements. But little ideas in people with big-thinking minds produce enormous achievements. Jesus said, ‘According to your faith let it be to you.’ (Matthew 9:29 NKJ) If you reached the age of 25 and still weren’t at your full height, you’d probably get an appointment with the doctor. It’s the same with every other part of our lives: ‘Let us not go back over the beginning lessons we learned about Christ. We should not again start teaching about faith in God and about turning away from those acts that lead to death.’ (Hebrews 6:1 NCV) And what else were you were put on earth for, but to grow in God and live in His ways? So what’s holding you back? If you embrace His purpose, you’ll have a good head–start in life. Jesus said, ‘If you have faith and do not doubt, you will...be able to say to this mountain, “Go, fall into the sea.” And if you have faith, it will happen.’ (Matthew 21:21 NCV) The size of your faith shapes how you’ll do. Don’t stay small. Launch out into the deep.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘Love each other with genuine affection...’ Romans 12:10 NLT</p>
<p>Putting others first is a basic pillar of Christian community. It’s an instruction that’s written time and time again in the New Testament. For example, ‘Be devoted to each other like a loving family. Excel in showing respect for each other.’ (Romans 12:10 GWT) Loving those who buy you presents and laugh at your jokes is easy, but Jesus actually tells us to love those who look down on us and would scorn our attempts at friendship, too. It’s there in Matthew 5:44 — ‘love your enemies’!</p>
<p>So before you start casting derogatory remarks, look at life from their point of view. You may need to simply accept that people come in all shapes and sizes, from all sorts of backgrounds, with all sorts of baggage. Again and again, Jesus met people that His fellow religious types had written off, but He didn’t brush them aside — He had compassion on them. And it’s His design for us as the Body of Christ that we do the same — with God’s love planted deep in our soul, we trust that He will activate compassion within us, even for those we wouldn’t otherwise give a second thought. We’re not saying that this will be easy. In fact, you’ll probably need some assistance — but, remember, God’s help is only a prayer away!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Everything in me will celebrate when you speak what is right.' Proverbs 23:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>We're not going to get through life without facing some kind of criticism. So we might as well learn to recognise the value of it. Whether you're a pastor, a plumber or a pilot, it's true that the people who do well are usually those who are humble enough to take criticism on board and use it to their benefit.</p>
<p>Ever noticed how humility isn't actually mentioned in the Galatians 5 passage on the Fruit of the Spirit? <em>Maybe that's because humility is the kind of soil that good fruit can grow in.</em> We all make mistakes (and if you think you don't, then ask the person next to you what they reckon - they'll probably give you a different answer!) and we need to learn from them.</p>
<p>When you receive criticism, before you reach for the Kleenex or start getting defensive, work out what's behind it. If it's coming from someone you respect, take the time (and the head space) to be honest with yourself, chew it over and if they've hit on something, do something about it. Jesus said, 'The truth will set you free.'

<introtext><![CDATA['He did not retaliate when He was insulted.' 1 Peter 2:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>'Sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me,' must be the most meaningless nursery rhyme of all-time. We all know it isn't true. Words can hurt. But with God on our side, we can have a confidence that makes us secure. Secure in who we are in Him, secure as a child of the living God, secure because we are made in His image, secure because we are a branch in the Vine of Jesus, secure because there is a plan and a purpose for our lives. </p>
<p>Sometimes you'll get criticised and the words will be just plain wrong. In that instance, take a deep breath, recognise it for what it is and move on. If Jesus had let every discouragement and put-down soak in, He might never have gone through with His master plan. </p>
<p>You're not responsible for the criticism you receive, but you do have the power over how it affects you. A smart, sarcastic response might be the most instinctive comeback. Turning the other cheek might sound like an old fashioned way to respond, but it could be the way to make God smile. Keep looking to Jesus as your example: 'He did not retaliate when He was insulted. When He suffered, He did not threaten to get even. He left His case in the hands of God, who always judges fairly.' (1 Peter 2:23 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It is to one's honour to avoid strife.' Proverbs 20:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Oops. You've made a mistake. A hash of it all. Fact is, it's not an innocent error. You've gone and done it. You've sinned. You can't hide and there are no fig leaves to wear. What do you do? Sit around and mope? </p>
<p>When Formula 1 cars have got a problem, the drivers don't just let the car grind to a halt, make a cup of tea and feel sorry for themselves. They get in the pit lane, correct the problem and get back on the track. There's a race to be won! The only real mistake is...to not learn from a mistake. Regain your focus, and put right what went wrong.</p>
<p>Proverbs says, 'As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.' (Proverbs 27:17 NLT) That's a good way to get right back on track. But with metal work, sparks can fly. A mate pulling you up might be hard in the short term, but it will help you to look up and look sharp. So don't fight fire with fire, because 'only fools insist on quarrelling.' (Proverbs 20:3 NLT) Instead, rise above the conflict, regain your clear sight and remember who God says you are, in Christ. The Bible says 'Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.' (James 5:16 NIV) Who can you take your sins to? Ask God for His strength as you walk forward again. </p>

Whether it's sharing our take on why the latest pop star wannabe failed, or taking part in a post football match discussion to slaughter the ref, we can't help ourselves. We like to dress it up, but usually it's nothing more than plain old nasty.</p>
<p>Jesus received a good share of 'critical analysis', sometimes for nothing more than where He was from. 'Nazareth! exclaimed Nathanael. Can anything good come from there? Just come and see for yourself, Philip said.' (John 1:46 NLT) And Nathanael did see, as over time Jesus showed him He was who He said He was. </p>
<p>Jesus had faith that His Father was for Him. If you've been criticised by another Christian, that faithfulness test is one of the things that shows how trustworthy you are, and it may prove to critics that they got you wrong. 'And if our God is with us, then what could stand against' is more than a line from a worship song. It's a deep-rooted mind-set that can empower you to do what God has called you to do, no matter how tough the criticism. </p>
<p>Judges 5:21 NIV says, 'March on, my soul; be strong.' Is there a dream you once had that you've given up on because of discouragement? Get on your knees, and pray life back in to that dream.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, point out the road for me to follow.' Psalm 25:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>The decisions we make are important. Standing in front of a non-Christian crowd to tell them that your life revolves around Jesus might take real guts... but ask yourself this: would they be able to tell how important Jesus is to you if you didn't? The decisions we make in our life should reflect who our God is. If we're going through life making woeful choices and continually picking our way out of a crisis situation, it won't reflect well on the holy and perfect God who we claim is in control of our lives. </p>
<p>Albert Camus said, 'Life is a sum of all your choices.' Are your choices different because of Jesus, or are they still focused on looking after number one? </p>
<p>'Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but be a new and different person with a new freshness in all you do and think. Then you will learn from your own experience how His ways will really satisfy you.' (Romans 12:2 TLB)</p>
<p>This isn't about Jesus saving us, and then instantly trusting us to spontaneously make the right choices all the time. That's the end goal, but we don't get there overnight. He tells us to be a new and different person. We can only do that with His strength, but it takes work. It's only when we train ourselves (in His grace and by His Spirit) by making a thousand little right choices that we can be trusted, when decision one-thousand-and-one arrives, to make the holy one. So decide now to put a plan in place that will enable you to follow Jesus more easily when the next big crunch comes along. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Created in Christ Jesus to do good works...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>God has made you a particular way for particular purposes, complete with specific gifts and talents. Being busy for the sake of it wasn't the plan. Lamborghini manufactures both tractors and sports cars. Although the badge is the same, their tractors aren't lightning fast and their sports cars can't tow a plough through a muddy field. So, turn to God, and let Him tell you what you're here for. </p>
<p>Henri Nouwen wrote: 'Many voices ask for our attention... But underneath all these often very noisy voices is a still, small voice that says, You are My Beloved, My favour rests on you. That's the voice we need most of all to hear. To hear that voice, however, requires special effort; it requires solitude, silence, and a strong determination to listen.'</p>
<p>You need to listen to God before you can start working for God. Sitting by God's feet is where you'll end up one day, and it's the only sure foundation for success in this life. It's difficult to find what He wants for your life until you can hear His voice above anyone else's - then, and only then, can you '...let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.' (Romans 12:2 NLT) </p>
<p>If you want God to tell you what you're here for, try finding a quiet place to spend time listening to Him. Ask Him to protect you from mishearing Him, or being deceived - read a chunk of the Bible first and ask Him what He'd like to share with you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will know how people must conduct themselves in the household of God.' 1 Timothy 3:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Just imagine your five fingers sitting down together for a good gossip-and-gripe session about how uppity the elbow has got. The idea that one part of the body could think itself superior to another part is pretty silly! They all have their own contribution to make. It's just like that in the Body of Christ - the Church - in your local area. </p>
<p>If you're at a good church, thank God, but watch out you don't damage the rest of the Body by bad-mouthing another group of Christians down the road. And, if there's one person that feels isolated in your own church... that's one person too many. But the answer to that problem might be you! There are always ways to help. Why not take them a cup of coffee, ask them how they are and start taking a heartfelt interest in their life. After all, 'God places the lonely in families' (Psalm 68:6 NLT), which means you may have some brothers and sisters at church you need to get acquainted with. </p>
<p>As well as isolation, gossip can ruin things, and needs to be dealt with - by you! Don't engage with it, even if it's dressed up as Christian concern. 'Do not criticise one another, my friends.' (James 4:11 GNT) Unless you are willing to talk directly to the person concerning something specific, don't talk about them. And don't let anybody else talk about them either. It might not be easy, but it is that straightforward. Be a good influence in your church. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It is too much for me.' Numbers 11:14 NCV<br /><br /><p>Moses was having a bad day. There he was, out in the desert with all the people God had called out of Egypt and, no matter which way he turned, there was moaning and complaining. 'No meat,' the people whined. 'No garlic. No melons. No cucumber. We were better off as slaves.' </p>
<p>No wonder Moses was fed up. These people were willing to give up their freedom for a cucumber! He started on his own moan to God. It might not seem an appropriate attitude from a servant of the Most High God, the man chosen to receive the Ten Commandments, but Moses had had enough. He was ready to toss in the towel. </p>
<p>But God had some advice: 'Gather for Me seventy men... and let them take their stand there with you. I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.' (Numbers 11:16-17 ESV)</p>
<p>Being a lone ranger can make you easy pickings for the enemy. So look around, pray, and share your load. </p>
<p>Belonging to a small group of Christians who can support you when life gets rough (and when it's just everyday up-and-downs) can be very helpful. If you're not already a member of a small group, ask your church about joining one.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They shall bear the burden...with you.' Numbers 11:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'I have a dream!' said Martin Luther King Jr. 'My lord, I have a cunning plan,' said Baldrick. You may be a visionary, but you will not succeed until you learn to inspire others with your vision and have them take it up for themselves. Top Tip Time: inspiring others requires credibility and conviction. People will only get involved if they can see that you're fully behind it yourself.</p>
<p>Psychologist Dr. Larry Crabb describes what it's like when the right message, spoken by the right messenger, is spoken to the right people: 'A vision we give to others of who and what they could become, has power when it echoes what the spirit has already spoken into their souls.' That power can convince people to join you in the pursuit of your vision, and greatly enhances your chances of success.</p>
<p>The Bible isn't a maths text book, but still here's an equation to ponder: one person can put a thousand others to flight, but two people can put ten thousand others to flight (Deuteronomy 32:30). The Scriptures teach us the power of working alongside each other. Take a group of people united in one vision, and the anointing of the Lord, and you'll accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Scripture would be fulfilled...' John 19:28 NIV <br /><br /><p>We're taking a different tack with these next two days' readings. Lots of people today shrug off Jesus by pointing to what they call the 'historical inaccuracy' of His resurrection. So we're going to try and look at a simple way of looking at Christ's resurrection that might not be so easy to write off.</p>
<p>Today we'll start by asking, 'What's the problem?' Well, even as far back as 50 AD or thereabouts, Paul said that the message of Christ was 'a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.' (1 Corinthians 1:23 NIV) This meant that Jews thought His death and resurrection was blasphemy ('God dying?! How dare you suggest it!'), and the Gentiles (people who didn't believe in Israel's God) thought coming back from the dead just didn't make sense!</p>
<p>The Gentiles were like many non-believers today: resurrection seems plain ridiculous to them. And perhaps they have a point. After all, people don't tend to come back to life after they die. And it's not scientifically provable that it actually happened, because in order for something to be <em>scientifically provable</em>, you need to be able to repeat it to test it... which we can't do either.</p>
<p>So what gives it that all-important credibility? That's something we'll look at tomorrow. But today, think about why you believe in Jesus. What makes you accept the Bible's story that He died and came back again? Are you able to give a reason for 'the hope that is within you'?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Scripture would be fulfilled...' John 19:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we asked you to think about why you believe in Jesus. Today, we'll take a quick look at what we think gives His message, death and resurrection believability.</p>
<p>Ever heard the phrase, 'There's no smoke without fire?' Think about that big oil rig explosion off the coast of America a couple of years ago. Even fifty kilometres away from the fire, the smoke kept on going and going.</p>
<p>It's like that with the disciples in the early church. They were incredibly passionate, some would have said insanely so, about their <em>real life relationship experience</em> with the risen Jesus. Smoke without fire? Mass hallucination? Sure, it's been claimed. But all the sceptics needed to do to quiet the Christians' commotion was produce Jesus' dead body. <em>So why didn't they?</em></p>
<p>Maybe the disciples stole it? But would so many have gone to their deaths (pretty gory ones too) for what they knew to be a lie, for no earthly gain?</p>
<p>Or maybe they were all honest fools, duped by a crazy <em>idea</em>. But, unlike followers of other religions, they didn't die for an idea, they died for what they had <em>seen and experienced</em> - Christ's resurrection - and His real life relationship with them, post-resurrection.</p>
<p>There's more - the Jewish historian Josephus mentioned the disciples' testimony, and was alive at their time. Heaps of Old Testament prophecies point to Jesus - you don't have to believe the Bible is holy to see that these historical predictions came true, even about things Jesus couldn't have invented (like where He was born!)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Roll the stone aside, Jesus told them.' John 11:39 NLT<br /><br />Lazarus was dead. There was no hiding it. It had been three days. But nothing's impossible with God, right? A heavy stone stood between Lazarus and new life. Then Jesus gave the command, 'Remove the stone.'<br />
<p>God knows how our hearts can become stone-hard. People hurt us. We hurt ourselves. We hurt other people. It's called sin, and it's more lethal than a terminal illness. Simply being a Christian doesn't make you immune. It subtly creeps in like cancer and causes us to die spiritually - and ultimately physically. All of this puts a solid wall between us and the fullness of life God wants for us.</p>
<p>But He is God, He is good and He hasn't left us alone. 'And I will give you a new heart with new and right desires, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony heart of sin and give you a new, obedient heart.' (Ezekiel 36:26 NLT) That's what Jesus can do - His power is strong enough to shift any stony heart, restore what you've lost and bring new life from certain death. Jesus enables you to be right with Him and others. But change only begins when you're willing to 'take away the stone' and allow God to deal with what's behind it. Are you willing to do that?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The grass withers...but the Word of our God stands forever.' Isaiah 40:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>The third and main reason for reading your Bible is because it's all about Jesus! Everything in the Bible in some way points towards the Son of GodHe is <b><i>the</b></i> most significant man who ever walked the earth. Other faiths talk about Jesus as a good man, a prophet or a moral teacher but that just doesn't get close to the truth. The Bible shows Jesus to be God Himself! And there's loads of historical and archaeological proof that the Bible holds its own as a piece of true historical literature. </p>
<p>This is what historian Philip Schaff had to say, 'This Jesus of Nazareth, without money and arms, conquered more millions than...Napoleon; without science and learning, He shed more light on things human and divine than all philosophers and scholars combined... He spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or since... without writing a single line, He set more pens in motion...than the whole army of great men of ancient and modern times.' And Napoleon Bonaparte himself said, 'I know men and I tell you that Jesus Christ is no mere man. Between Him and every other person in the world there is no possible term of comparison... Jesus Christ founded His empire upon love.' </p>
<p>The Bible. Don't miss out. Find your love for Jesus, and from that place, get stuck into reading about Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[‘Let us not…judge one another anymore ...’ Romans 14:13 KJV<br /><br />‘It’s not God I’ve got a problem with, it’s those so–called Christians!’<br />You might have heard some people say this kind of thing, but have they got a point? Judgmental, holier–than–thou types can drive people round the bend — and right out of Church! When Jesus first told the story of the prodigal son, His intended audience was the Pharisees: the religious do–gooders of the time; and in classic Jesus–style, He used a simple story to get under their skin. The older brother in the story may have known how to be a dutiful son, but he certainly didn’t know how to be a brother. Maybe it’s no surprise the younger son walked out the door. <br />The apostle Paul says, ‘Don’t condemn each other any more...’ (Romans 14:13 NLT) Power and status over other people can be a serious temptation and when you find yourself feeling you’re ‘better’ than someone else — whether they’ve left the Church, or are just struggling with things you’ve got sorted — it can give you a serious ego boost. He goes on: ‘Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not put an obstacle in another Christian’s path.’ (Romans 14:13 NLT) Don’t let your heart get poisoned with pride. Make sure your Heavenly Father can say you’ve been a good sibling, as well as a good son or daughter. And when we’re tempted to sneer down on those who have left the Church, just think — that may well be the attitude that drove them away in the first place. <br /><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 63–66, John 13:18–30, Ps 114, Pr 27:20–22<br /><br /><br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2012 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=46868&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></span>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Joshua...summoned all the men of Israel and said...&quot;Put your feet on the necks of these kings...&quot;' Joshua 10:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>After literally years of waiting, Joshua got to live in the land God has promised the Israelites. It was <i>amazing</i>. After nearly four decades, he was finally there but then he found everyone was out to do him over! Five kings with armies, each with their own weird name: AdoniZedek king of Jerusalem, Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon. They all combined against Joshua for one massive scrap, but God was on Joshua's side. What followed is a rather unpleasant death for each of them. </p>
<p>But what's in a name? The meaning of each king's name might be significant, by warning us about certain attitudes that can rob us of all that we can be. The first king's name is all about 'robbing our peace'. With no peace, doing the simplest thing is a nightmare. The second warns us about 'being religious'. The third means 'like a wild ass'-enough said?! But also, this 'wildness' could refer to being isolated from other Christians. The fourth means 'shining'. This isn't bad in itself. However, if you reckon you're God's gift to the world and are lapping up the glory, you're just idolising yourself. Finally: Debir, the last king: his warns us about bad mouthing other Christians. Whatever stinking attitude you've got: put your foot down and kill it!</p>
<p>You can read the story for yourself in Joshua 10:16-27. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.' Joshua 10:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes life's a battle. Just when you feel you're making advances, a hand grenade comes at you from round the corner. Great! Joshua probably felt pretty overwhelmed himself. Taking on one army's one thing, but to have five come at you is a bit much. And without God, it would be far too much. But this is WITH God. </p>
<p>Can't multitask? God can! Is life piling on the pressure? God wants you to stand solid in Him. The Bible says 'We live by faith, not by sight.' (2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV) This means that we're not going to know how it's all going to pan out, or how God's going to provide. We can't be sure certain things will turn out the way <i>we</i> hope or expect. But God is with us through it all. In fact, He promises He will 'never leave you...never abandon you.' (Hebrews 13:5 GNT) And He never goes back on a promise! </p>
<p>Looking at our life with our own tiny human perspective only reveals part of God's big picture. The grand old duke of York had ten thousand men, but they were up, down and all over the place! Emotions are no different. If you allow your emotions to rule your life you will be up one minute and down the next. Do you think life is supposed to be an up and down experience? Wrong! God's plan for you is to get down on your knees to pray, then get up in faith and do what He's told you to do.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-most-important-relationship]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I never knew you, go away...' Matthew 7:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>The most important relationship you will ever have for the rest of your life is the one you have with God Himself. It's one you will be in for all eternity and it's the very reason you were created in the first place. So the question is: on a busy day when your mum wants to chat about your studies and your friend calls to invite you round, but your youth club is about to start, which do you drop first? Would it even cross your mind that you've spent no time with God lately?</p>
<p>For centuries Bible experts have argued about the point when someone is 'saved' and whether you can lose your place in Heaven once you've got it. The truth of the matter is, on the final day when you're standing face to face with Jesus, the simple question will be: <i>'</i><i>D</i><i>o you know me?'</i> You see it doesn't matter what we've done and what we've said. The question is: do you have a real relationship with Jesus? When you look into someone's eyes, you both know whether or not you have a relationship. There's only two of you, you can't fake it or pretend you have if you've not. Nothing needs to be said, you both know exactly where you stand. </p>
<p>So remember, although you can look like a fantastic Christian on paper, it's really all about you and Jesus-nothing else matters. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['On the third day, He shall rise again.' Luke 18:33 NIV<br /><br /><p>Halloween Night is an annual bit of so-called 'fun' when parents dress their children up as Satan's little helpers and demand treats from neighbours 'or else'!</p>
<p>It's true that Christians are known for being a bit sensitive when it comes to the subject of 'Halloween', but everyone with a braincell between their ears ought to see that there are better things to throw a party over! And anyway, if it's out-of-this-world supernatural stuff you're looking for then crack open the party-poppers for Jesus; He's King of the supernatural:</p>
<p> (1) Demons shrieked when He walked down the street-and ran from Him fearing His power to bind them in eternal chains with a single Word (2) The forces of nature obeyed His command, water turned to wine, crashing waves became gentle ripples and fish even coughed up coins! (3) He died, and then rose from the dead! He didn't return from the grave as a moaning, groaning half-dead shadow of His former self; His resurrected body was now fit for eternity, like ours will be when we're raised to reign with Him on the final day.</p>
<p>The most supernatural thing of all is that Jesus is here right now with you by His Holy Spirit. Say, 'Hello,' right now; ask Jesus to say, 'Hello,' right back in your life. </p>
<p>There's a prayer at the back of this magazine to introduce you to Jesus and make today just Hello not Halloween.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.' John 5:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Gandhi once said, 'You Christians look after a document containing enough dynamite to blow all civilisation to pieces, turn the world upside down and bring peace to a battle-torn planet. But you treat it as if it is nothing more than a piece of literature.' The Bible is the Word of God, it's deep, earthshaking truth on paper, it's the keys to transformed living; but it's hard to ignore the fact Gandhi's right about our attitudes. How can those of your mates who won't go near a Bible discover God for themselves?</p>
<p>Well, your friends may read the Bible 1% of the time, but they read you 99% of the time. That means you and I have a job on our hands. We're called to be Bible 'translators', of a sort. Our words and attitudes should 'translate' the Bible from words on a page to life, and communicate some of the truth about God to those around us. 'If my friends were only to open the Bible,' we think, 'they'd find themselves face-to-face with God's truth!' Here's the thing. If they look at us, they should really be able to see the same deep, earthshaking truth of God, in the flesh! That sort of a light-up-the-world life is promised for us, but it's not guaranteed. It's only when we've spent time in God's presence - when we've seen and heard - that we will be able to 'translate' God's truth in a way that compels others to listen.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, through all the generations You have been our home!' Psalm 90:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>At the end of a hard day it feels good to come home to a place you know - a place where you can kick off your shoes, be yourself, and not worry about what anybody thinks. And reverently speaking, God's presence can become equally comfortable to you too. With time, you can learn to go to Him for strength, for protection, and for guidance. God wants you to be at home in His presence and aware of His nearness at all times. We think of God as a deity to talk about instead of a place to dwell, but God wants us to see Him as the One in whom '...we live and move and have our being...' (Acts 17:28 NIV) When God led the children of Israel through the wilderness, He didn't just show up once a day and then disappear. No, the pillar of fire was there with them all night and the cloud of smoke was with them all day. God never leaves us. Jesus promised, '...I am with you always...' (Matthew 28:20 NIV) The Psalmist said, 'The one thing I ask of the Lord - the thing I seek most - is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life...' (Psalm 27:4 NLT) You might be thinking... 'I'd love to live in God's house too, but I'm stuck in the real world.' Actually; you are just one decision away from your Father's presence. You don't need to change your address - just your perception. Wherever you go today, whatever you face today, remind yourself: 'He is with me!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['All these men of war...were of one mind to make David king.' 1 Chronicles 12:38 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Read a bit about King David's soldiers in 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles and a band of hulking warriors might come to mind. Sword-toting, arrow-slinging, 'they looked like lions and were as fast as gazelles on the hills.' (1 Chronicles 12:8 GWT) These guys sound like merciless killing machines! But read between the lines, and you'll see that underneath their leather hides and thick skins was something more than brute force. What made David's warriors <em>valiant</em>?</p>
<p>There are three basic things that made them the cream of the crop. They never gave up when the going got tough. They worked together as a team. And they always stayed faithful to their commander. You're probably not enlisted in a regiment like David's, but you could still learn a thing or two from these guys! The spirit of a valiant warrior - God's kind, anyway - goes deeper.</p>
<p>Just as they trained to be persistent in hard times, so should we. 2 Timothy 2:3 NIV says, 'Endure hardship...like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.' In the same spirit of unity that they had, Philippians 2:2 NLT asks us to '[agree] wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.' And just as they are to stay close to their commander, Hebrews 3:1 NIV talks straight to us: 'Holy brothers and sisters, God chose you... So keep thinking about Jesus... We believe in Him.'</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

After all, I'm doing it for God.</em>' We may have good intentions, but just because we think we're doing something for God doesn't necessarily mean it's ok!</p>
<p>King David wanted to do something special for God. He laid down plans to bring God's Ark back to Jerusalem (nothing to do with Noah - this was the Ark of the Covenant, a holy container housing the original stones engraved with the Ten Commandments.)</p>
<p>As the leader of an army of united and determined warriors, the whole nation was behind David. But, caught up in eagerness, he had not paid attention to God's instructions. He chose a convenient way to get the job done, ignoring the obedient way. The consequences were fatal for a man called Uzzah (you can read about it in 1 Chronicles 13.)</p>
<p>David had the right motives but the wrong methods. In trying to be sincere, he got things sincerely wrong. David learned the hard way that God's will must be done in God's way. Learn from David's mistake, don't repeat it. Remember: both your motives and your methods matter to God.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['If you do not carry your own cross and follow Me, you cannot be My disciple.' Luke 14:27 NLT<br /><br /><p>This is tough talk from Jesus. He's asking his listeners to take a position: <em>are you in or out? Are you with Me or not?</em> And the way He said He knows you're serious about being His disciple comes down to actions, not just words.</p>
<p>Discipleship counts the cost: are you willing to take the responsibilities as well as the rewards of following Jesus? There are countless benefits in being a Christian but there's also a high cost.</p>
<p>Many people wear a cross as jewellery. Jesus' first followers wouldn't have thought that there's anything pretty about identifying yourself as a Christian this way - after all the cross was an instrument of torture and death. So when Jesus talks about carrying our crosses, He's talking about being willing to sacrifice our own agendas.</p>
<p>And that's the heart of the matter: if it comes to it, are you willing to let your own goals, glory and gain 'die' for the sake of following the Master? If your answer is 'no', Jesus is clear: you cannot be His disciple. Ouch.</p>
<p>Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection said: 'Let us think often, that our only business in this life is to please God.' Practice asking yourself this question before each action, word or thought: 'Will this please the Lord?'</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Martha...you are worried and upset about many things...' Luke 10:41 NIV<br /><br /><p>In Matthew 10:29 NIV, Jesus says 'Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.' The sparrows that were common at the time Jesus said this were noisy little nuisances, and they were everywhere. Market traders would catch a handful to sell for a penny, but they weren't much of a meal. Worse than that, they would nestle in any place they could find. King David noticed that they even settled near God's altars (Psalm 84:3)! </p>
<p>And yet, God grants the sparrow - an everyday, insignificant creature - His attention. His eyes are on every creature, no matter how small. So how much more will He grant us His care? </p>
<p>If you were to pluck a single hair from your head, God would know the exact number left behind. (Luke 12:7) As you go outside today, notice the sky, flowers, trees, birds and clouds. Think about this - God ensures that every part of His creation can be provided for, from sweeping fields of corn and flowers, to the most miniature insect. (Luke 12:24-28) He sees every detail. Sometimes it's easy to get worked up about every little thing that comes up, just like Martha did when Jesus popped round for tea. Jesus helped Martha put her life in better perspective: 'Martha...only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen...it...' And what had Mary chosen? Sitting at the feet of Jesus! God provides daily, just enough, no more and no less. We can, and should, fix our eyes on that fact.</p>
<p>When you wake up each day, take time to find things you can think of to thank God for. Everything down to the breath in your lungs comes from Him, so there should be no shortage!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love one another: just as I have loved you.' John 13:34 ESV<br /><br /><p>When Jesus says, 'Love one another,' the word He uses has a sense of <em>self-sacrificing nurture</em>. Think of a mother and her child. He's saying that we should love one another like that - treating each other gently, affectionately, and always seeking the best for each other.</p>
<p>You might think of someone in your church or youth group and think the kind of love they need most is tough love. But beneath the mask, we all desperately need to be nurtured. God gives us the church, youth groups and friends so we can nurture and be nurtured.</p>
<p>The story is told of a little girl who came home from church one Sunday and announced, 'I want to be like the man who stood up in the pulpit today.' Delighted, her mum said, 'That's lovely, dear. So you want to go into the ministry?' 'No,' she replied, 'I want to tell people what to do!'</p>
<p>Some of us want to be authority figures so we can correct people and give them our so-called 'constructive criticism'. But most people don't need a critic, they need a cheerleader. When you nurture people they will welcome you to speak into their life - and they will listen. Paul wrote, 'Encourage each other and build each other up.' (1 Thessalonians 5:11 NLT) With a simple phone call, txt or email you could encourage someone today!</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['This I call to mind and therefore I have hope.' Lamentations 3:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>'I was twelve at the time,' recalled a woman in her forties, 'when...for the first time I spoke to God, knowing He was alive and listening. I asked Him if we could be best friends forever, and He said, Yes! I often look back and remember that day, especially on bad hair days - those days when I'm confused, full of doubt, disappointed, fearful, lonely, anxious, hurting, full of self-loathing, or plain disillusioned with life.'</p>
<p>It's said that 'we're not slow learners, just quick forgetters.' In the Bible, when God separated the Jordan River for His people to walk through, He told them to build a statue of stones there so that they would always remember the miracle He'd done for them. It was a physical object, anchoring God's trustworthiness in a constant presence. It was to help them call God's goodness to mind. Just like the lady in today's story has done, and just like God's people did, it's important for you to mark out some key moments when you knew God was there for you. Obviously it doesn't have to be a tower of stones, but what can you create to remind yourself of times God was there for you? A journal of collected prayers? Post-it notes of things God has done? It's up to you, but the important thing is to remember to remember... so that we don't forget in the dark what God has done for us in the light. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Only fools say in their hearts, There is no God.' Psalm 14:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>Here's something you don't need to be reminded of: being openly Christian in a mainstream school or a secular workplace is tough. It can feel like you're swimming upstream all the time - like everyone's going in the opposite direction to you. How do you cope with being Christian in a classroom full of (seeming) atheists?</p>
<p>1. <em>Be informed</em>. The Bible is a miraculous book - from the way it was written, handed down and translated, to its amazing unity. Jesus lived, and no credible historian will dispute the evidence of His life and ministry. And two billion believers worldwide and generations of men and women who changed the world claim to have met Him. Spend time reading good books and learning about the reasons why your faith makes complete sense.</p>
<p>2.<em> Be gracious</em>. Nobody is ever argued into the Kingdom of God: they are loved into it. Most people need to feel they belong before they could consider believing. So pray for your unbelieving friends and ask God for opportunities to show them His love. Be patient, but expect God to open doors for you. Remember: the majority of atheists out there aren't die-hards, rather they have never had a chance to get to know God yet.</p>
<p>Build up your faith by learning why the Christian faith makes sense (this is sometimes called 'apologetics'). There are great resources available by people like Ravi Zacharias and Chuck Missler. Check them out on <em>YouTube</em>.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get it all?' Luke 12:20 NLT<br /><br /><p><em>Gimme, gimme, gimme, more, more, more</em>! It's easy to become consumed with getting stuff, the latest, coolest, trendiest...<em>things. Or our image: Let's spruce ourselves up and look the part, life's for living - now!</em></p>
<p>Life can easily become all about the here and now, with no thought about what's next. But what is next? What's happening when the party's over? Is there another one? Where are we going when this life ends?</p>
<p>It's said that the average body has enough phosphorus to make 2200 match heads, enough sugar to go into 60 cubes, enough salt to fill 20 spoons, and enough iron to make about $10 worth of nails. The rest is just dust and water. When we pamper the part of us that's on the surface and neglect the fact there's much more to us than skin and muscles, it's no wonder that God calls us 'fools'!</p>
<p>No one can guarantee when they will die, only that they definitely will. So take note, and take care of your whole being, because it's all intertwined - soul and body - and if you're part of God's family, it's destined for something much bigger and better than just this life.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Did Abner die like a fool?' 2 Samuel 3:33 NCV<br /><br /><p>Two opposing armies had come face to face. They had taken up daggers and swords, and both ended up beating the other to a pulp. The fighting just kept going from bad to worse. Abner came face to face with Asahel: 'Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot.' (2 Samuel 2:23 NKJ) Now Joab (Asahel's brother) was out to get him! But instead of staying inside the city of Hebron where he would be protected, Abner met with his enemy at the city gates. Joab took the opportunity to kill him. 'He drew his dagger and killed Abner in revenge.' (2 Samuel 3:27 NLT)</p>
<p>'Did Abner die like a fool?' He knew what to do - and didn't do it. There were no rivers to cross to get to freedom, no mountains to climb, no fees to be paid. Hebron was a city of sanctuary - a safe refuge for anyone pursued for a crime. All Abner had to do was stay inside. A life-saving decision he foolishly chose to ignore.</p>
<p>Jesus calls us to Him. It's sensible to go to Him. It's life-saving. It's life-<em>changing</em>. Most of all, it's the only proper response to the announcement that He is the true King of everything and everywhere.</p>
<p>Don't fool around with this life. Don't stop at the gates. Romans 10:9 NIV tells us that when you '... confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' Isn't it time to make a choice for Him?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever you plant is what you'll harvest.' Galatians 6:7 GWT<br /><br /><p>The Bible is full of helpful hints and trustworthy tips that, when acted upon, move us towards real change for the better. Do you want to come up smelling of roses? Then take notice of this pretty piece of advice: '...whatever seed a man puts in, that will he get back as grain... He who puts in the seed of the flesh will...get the reward of death; but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will...get the reward of eternal life.' (Galatians 2:7-8 BBE)</p>
<p>If you think of your words and actions like seeds and the person you speak them to as soil, then your words are about the harvest that you end up with. So, for example, if you speak lies to a friend, an untrustworthy relationship will grow. The only way to build good, solid relationships is to talk with words that are true, kind and generously spoken. Out of that grows faithful friendships. </p>
<p>What about how you talk to yourself? Someone once asked, 'If you had a friend who spoke to you in the same way that you sometimes speak to yourself, how long would you allow that person to be your friend?' Could it be that you are your harshest critic? Little words of criticism, telling yourself that you are not being pretty enough, thin enough, clever enough, good enough? Speak God's words of love, forgiveness, beauty and strength into your own life too, and see how they grow. Set yourself a challenge today: speak words that build people up, and don't say anything critical about anyone - and that includes yourself.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you shepherds after my own heart. They will...feed you with knowledge and insight.' Jeremiah 3:15 GWT<br /><br /><p>Did you know that over 50% of those who enter full-time Christian ministry leave it within ten years because of discouragement? Ground down by the demands of unappreciative people, starved of positive words, they just give up and go back to something else. Isn't that tragic?</p>
<p>'Pastor' simply means <em>shepherd</em> - and God knows we need shepherds. In many ways we're just like sheep - often we're a bit thick, we don't know what's good for us, we follow the herd and we get ourselves into some real scrapes. But a pastor leads their sheep to safe places where they can feed and protects them from predators and other dangers.</p>
<p>Pastors need pastoring too. Of course, they need to look first of all to Jesus, who calls himself the Good Shepherd (see John 10: 1-17). But we have a part to play - and there's a good reason why.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:17 NCV says God gives us leaders and spiritual mentors to '...watch over [our] souls...' and we are to give them reason to do this 'with joy, not sadness'. Interestingly, the writer finishes with a few extra words: 'That would certainly not be for your benefit.' (NLT) Loving the leaders God has given us is good for us too. We can do this in practical ways like praying for them, encourage them and thank them next time you see them.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['God...is able...to accomplish infinitely more...' Ephesians 3:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>Being born wasn't your doing, and it's probably for the best that it wasn't! Imagine if everyone had control over what went into 'us'. We'd probably all turn out pretty similar, because our creativity is seriously limited compared to the Creator of the universe. 'God... is able... to accomplish infinitely more.' </p>
<p>He only made one you, with all the true individuality and uniqueness that comes from an infinitely creative God. You are an incredible masterpiece - the one and only you that ever has been or ever will be. How amazing! 'Thank You for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvellous.' (Psalm 139:14 NLT)</p>
<p>Sometimes being different can make you feel misunderstood, like no one sees the real you. But know this: God made you, so He 'gets' you. In fact God knows you better than you know yourself; He knows your thoughts, your comings and goings, how many hairs are on your head... He knows everything about you. More than that, He has put inside you heaps of potential; He says in Jeremiah 29:11 NLT: 'I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.'</p>
<p>Get to know your Creator. Then you'll truly be able to celebrate being you, enjoy being different, and be excited about what's ahead. Run hard. Eat up His words. Dream big dreams. God promises that 'through His mighty power at work within us, [we are able] to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Don't give up.' Galatians 6:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>'If at first you don't succeed try, try, try again' is an expression that some believe dates back to Scotland in the fourteenth century. The legend says, after suffering a major defeat at the hands of the English, Scottish king Robert the Bruce went and hid in a cave. There he watched a spider trying to spin a web. Each time the spider failed, it simply started again. So inspired was Robert by the little creature that he returned to his troops and led a series of victories against the English.</p>
<p>Most of us underestimate the time it takes to achieve anything of lasting value. We have one diet drink and expect to lose a kilo in a day. We participate in one gym session and hope to be running the Sydney Marathon by the weekend. We lift a few weights and hope to see better muscle definition overnight. </p>
<p>In order to achieve great things, we have to put the hard work in. No cutting corners - that's a sign of impatience and lack of self-discipline. Whatever you're aiming for it's important you keep going. Paul wrote: 'Don't get discouraged and give up, for we will reap a harvest of blessing at the appropriate time.' (Galatians 6:9 NLT)</p>
<p>So, whatever it is that's worthwhile that you're working on, don't give up. Pray about it now, and ask God to help you stick at it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.' Matthew 24:35 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the 1450s the first Bible came off the newly invented printing press. Today it's still the world's best-selling book. Over the years, many words have written about the Bible and these, from an a anonymous author long ago, might sound a bit old-fashioned but they still sum it up pretty well: 'It is a light to direct you, food to nourish you, and comfort to cheer you. It is the traveller's road map, the pilot's compass, the soldier's weapon, and the player's game plan. It's a mine of incredible wealth, and a river of genuine joy. Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are binding, its histories are true, and its decisions are immutable. Christ is its grand subject, your good its design, and the glory of God its end. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, practice it to be spiritually healthy. Read it slowly, frequently and prayerfully. Let it fill your memory, rule your heart, and guide your steps. It is given to you in life, will be opened at the judgment, and be remembered for ever. It involves the highest responsibility, will reward the greatest labour, and judge those who trifle with its sacred contents.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am the vine; you are the branches...' John 15:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>'There goes Jesus again with His fancy analogies,' some of the disciples no doubt thought. Maybe Peter wondered, 'Shouldn't we be doing something useful, like healing the sick?' But Jesus wanted them to understand how important just being with Him was. He didn't want them clocking in and clocking out. 'I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in Me, and I in them, will produce much fruit.' (John 15:5 NLT) </p>
<p>But why go for vine as a picture? Wouldn't a palm tree have been better? They produce nice coconuts, and are tall and strong, which could surely represent Jesus. Oh, and the pretty branches too, they could be us! No, Jesus knew exactly what He was saying. The unique thing about the branches of a vine is that they're all interwoven with the vine, so you can't tell what is branch and what is vine. </p>
<p>That's our benchmark too. Our lives should channel His nature, so you can't tell what's 'God' and what's 'us'. He wants us close - as close as a marriage, in fact. Jesus wants us to keep giving every part of our lives to Him, holding nothing back, so that He can transform it. So let's do that! If a husband only spoke to his wife when he wanted something, it wouldn't be long before their marriage was in trouble. The more we go to Jesus, the more we'll grow like Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['People did whatever seemed right in their own eyes...' Judges 17:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>We all need time to be alone - a safe place to just reflect and be ourselves. But we need to be careful that our 'me time' doesn't develop into 'secret space' time where we start doing things that we don't speak about to anyone. When we have no one to question our actions, we're in danger of becoming a law unto ourselves. The people in the book of Judges did that - just whatever they thought was right. And they ended up in over their heads in trouble.</p>
<p>The more we allow secret space time into our lives the more we open ourselves up to things that will damage and hold us back. Eating disorders, self-harming and porn addiction are a just a few of the harmful things that begin in secret spaces.</p>
<p>There is within us a natural tendency to sin, so we are called to 'walk in the light' where our motives and actions are transparent and we are encouraged to avoid sin. (1 John 1:7)</p>
<p>You don't need to go announcing to the world every last detail of your life. But you do need at least one person to be accountable to - someone mature, who knows God's Word and who will keep your confidence as well as love you enough to be honest with you. Ask someone today to be your <em>accountability buddy</em>. Someone who can give you the help you need, someone you can be open and honest with, and you can listen to with respect.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['People did whatever seemed right in their own eyes...' Judges 17:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>If everyone's doing it, it's ok, right? Wrong! When your mates swear, lie, are sexually active outside of marriage, get drunk, experiment with drugs, take a sickie or fight, it doesn't mean it's ok for you to do the same!</p>
<p>Sound familiar? You've probably heard that sort of advice a hundred times (and it is good advice, even if it's not always told in a helpful way!) But when you're tempted to do one of those things, right and wrong can feel a bit fuzzier... </p>
<p>Truth is, God doesn't disappear when people dispute His existence. God's ideas on living right don't lose their power just because people choose to ignore them. Lots of people around us have, willingly or not, bought into a very pretty lie - that they can follow every whim without consequence. </p>
<p>Don't live like that - Christians aren't going against the flow just for the sake of it. We're called to, 'remember the Lord in everything [we] do, and He will show [us] the right way.' (Proverbs 3:6 GNT) We catch a hold of His better life for us, one that is high above the world's, by listening for His voice. </p>
<p>In the book of Joshua, you'll discover a nation that hung onto every word God spoke. But one book later in Judges, you'll find a defeated nation who doesn't believe in God. The first is strong and law-abiding, the second weak and lawless. You'd think you were reading about two groups of people. But in a few short years, the people of Israel had gone from listening for God's voice to doing whatever they felt like. The fact is God never changes. But we can. So let's make sure we stay true!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have great faith! Your request is granted.' Matthew 15:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's not the sort of response you'd expect from Jesus. A woman came up to Him, begging for help and He basically told her to go away. He may have been polite about it but that's hardly the point. It all started when a Canaanite woman came up to Him. The incident is told in Matthew 15:22-28 NIV: 'Lord...my daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession,' and He said, 'I was sent only to...Israel...It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.' Most of us would have been put off by this putdown - but not this woman. 'Yes, Lord,' she said, 'but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.' Did Jesus have a twinkle in His eye then? 'Woman,' He said, 'you have great faith! Your request is granted.' </p>
<p>Talk about obstacles! Jesus isn't exactly welcoming her with open arms by saying she didn't belong to the right race. Most of us would have walked away offended. Not her! She stayed the distance. She didn't give up. She wasn't asking for what she deserved, she was crying out for what she needed! She stayed there long enough for Jesus to answer her prayer. In reality, she told Jesus, 'Let the children have the bread, all I need are the crumbs.' None of us are asking for what we deserve (if we got that, we'd be in deep trouble!) but, if we persist in asking for the blessing of the crumbs, we'll still have more than we ever need. </p>
<p>Do you ever feel like giving up on Jesus? If you're not seeing God's answer just yet, take a lesson from the Canaanite woman and don't give up!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The years...pass quickly, and then we are gone.' Psalm 90:10 NCV<br /><br /> 

<p>There are a variety of ways to measure a year - days, weeks, months, sunsets, midnights... or cups of coffee. What most people agree on is that time is precious and has a habit of flying. We often think, 'I wish I had more time', but the reality is that we only have as much this week as we did last week: 168 hours precisely.</p>
<p>The real question is how you're spending your time. Some things demand our time -  course commitments, work rosters or revising for exams. But what about all those other hours that you do get to decide about - your 'free' time? Are those hours dedicated to the couch while you impersonate a potato?</p>
<p>It's a question of worship, actually. Just as we can do with money, we can worship God with how we choose to spend our time - using it wisely to grow in love for Jesus and for others, or frittering it away on selfish pleasures.</p>
<p>We should offer our time to God in prayer, ask how He wants us to use it and be open to changing our plans. At the end of the day, one thing's sure: the best way to measure a year is in love.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The younger son...journeyed to a far country.' Luke 15:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It's easy to look around you, compare your life to your mate's next door and come to the conclusion that this Christianity business isn't everything it's cracked up to be. Over the next few days, we'll be looking at the story Jesus told of the Prodigal Son and asking why, two thousand years later, people are still leaving Church. (Side note: that's Church with a big C, aka the Body of Christ, aka being a part of Christianity. People leaving their local church and remaining in the faith is a different thing altogether, and not what we'll be looking at here.)</p>
<p>Blessings, a transformed life, a new spiritual family, God's unconditional love? Yes, please! But give it a little time and the shine can start to fade. Before you know it, the shops, the beach, your own bed, even homework can all seem more attractive than being at church on Sunday morning. In the story, it was the son's choice to leave his dad's home. There was no 'holding him hostage'. The father actually showed great respect for the son by letting him go. The point is that if you will not be held by the love of God, then He won't use His power to stop you.</p>
<p>But where did the son's choice get him in the end? Answer: a mess. A pig-stinking, hunger-panged, guilt-ridden mess. But none of that was any matter to the loving Father; that son would always be His son. As you take the time to re-read the story of the Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-21, consider: <em>do you need to come back?</em></p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['We have come to believe and know...You.' John 6:69 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It can be tempting to think that if Jesus was around today, performing miracles and healing the sick, it would make it easier to drop our own plans and follow Him. But it was just as challenging to follow Jesus then as it is now - and He knew it! The masses loved it when Jesus turned a packed lunch into a family feast for over five thousand, but when He went on to reveal what following Him would cost them, some of them couldn't stomach it. </p>
<p>It's no different today. You can listen to the most amazing inspirational sermon at church on a Sunday, but it's only Tuesday before you feel back to square one. Sticking with Jesus takes obedience.</p>
<p>Peter, the fisherman turned disciple, got it right. Jesus confronted His disciples on their stick-ability: 'Do you also want to leave?' and Peter replied, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ.' (John 6:66-69 NKJ) Notice how Peter called Jesus 'Lord' (or 'Boss') - He knew that what Jesus said went. Do you need to recommit your life to Jesus? If you feel comfortable in your Christianity, how do these words challenge you? Or are there parts of your life where you need to acknowledge Jesus as King? Pass these over to God, in prayer.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If you listen to correction, you grow in understanding.' Proverbs 15:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we looked at receiving criticism and today we're going to look at healthy ways to pull other people up. Imagine there's a scale of justice and mercy, with justice at one end and mercy at the other. Jesus was obviously perfect. John describes Him as being 'full of grace and truth'. (John 1:14 ESV) Jesus had justice and mercy meshed in perfect harmony. More often than not, we don't. Perhaps you've heard this illustrated with the quirky phrase, 'You can fall off a horse both ways.' </p>
<p>So, let's consider this minefield: 'Improving situations through constructively criticising others!' First, it's worth asking yourself whether you can handle criticism yourself. If you can't, but you still go round telling everyone else what they should be doing, you're making yourself look like a hypocrite. Secondly, ask yourself what your motives are for dishing it out. To make yourself look wise? For a bit of spiritual prestige? Then you may well be proud. Thirdly, are you fuelled by blame? Then you'll only come across as judgmental and you won't get taken seriously. Fourthly, have you got ideas of how to go forward? If not, is it even helpful to open your mouth? And finally, are you speaking the truth in love? Do they know you genuinely care about them? If you're not respecting them but just shovelling information down their throats, they'll see through it. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Run the race that lies ahead of us and never give up.' Hebrews 12:1 GWT<br /><br /><p>Look what Jesus endured: (1) Temptation. We imagine the wilderness temptation as three isolated events scattered over a forty-day period. No: 'The devil tempted Jesus for forty days...' (Luke 4:2 NCV) Every step, whispering in His ear; every turn of the path, sowing doubt; forty days of non-stop temptation! When it was over Satan would flee, angels would come and strengthen Him, and He would leave the wilderness to go out and minister as no one ever has. But first He had to get through the temptation. So do you. And the good news is, strengthened by God's grace, you can. (2) Accusation. '...Some said, &quot;He is a good man.&quot; Others replied, &quot;No, He deceives the people.&quot;' (John 7:12 NIV) 'The people retorted, &quot;You...devil! Didn't we say all along that you were possessed by a demon?&quot;' (John 8:48 NLT) They accused Him unfairly, but Jesus kept running. You must too. (3) Rejection. His family thought He was mad. The neighbours treated Him badly. When He returned to His home town they tried to throw Him off a cliff (Luke 4:29). But Jesus kept running. So must you. (4) Shame. At the cross He became 'sin' personified (2 Corinthians 5:21). Though He never stole, lied or lusted, He bore the shame of every thief, liar and adulterer. How did Jesus do it? What kept Him going? The Bible answers: '...Who for the joy set before Him endured...' (Hebrews 12:2 NIV) Jesus had already lived in Heaven, and knowing what awaited Him enabled Him to endure and finish the race. And the same joy awaits you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who heeds counsel is wise.' Proverbs 12:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p><i>The old wooden door of the office creaked open</i><i>.</i><i> </i><i>'</i><i>Hark</i><i>,</i><i> sister Sylvia, what seemeth</i><i> to be thy ailment?</i><i>'</i><i> </i><i>'</i><i>Well</i><i>,</i><i> sister Margaret, I no longer fit into my trouser</i><i>eth and wouldst therefore like thee to pray that the Lord wouldst miraculously remove this tyre from my waistline.</i><i>'</i><i> </i><i>'</i><i>Ahh...</i><i>sister Sylvia</i><i>,</i><i> could I asketh thee...</i><i>Hast thou exerciseth</i><i> and partaken of a diet of sound nutrition?</i><i>'</i><i> </i><i>'</i><i>Sister Margaret! It is not for thee to guilt trip me regarding Big Macs and Doritos, but to pray!</i><i>'</i></p>
<p>You might have come across people like this. They just expect prayer to be a magic wand that saves the day, while they do things that are obviously going to get them in a jam. Or maybe that's you? Prayer is important, but so is how you focus your time and energy. If someone comes to you with a problem, you might do well to ask some sensible questions.</p>
<p>Like: 'What do <i>you</i> think caused the problem...? What have you done about it? What do you feel God has said? What are you planning to do next?' If someone comes to you for advice, it can be tempting to bring all the memory verses you can think of in to play, but is it necessary? </p>
<p>And 'don't think you know it all.' (Romans 12:16 NLT) If you're not sure what to advise, be honest, and point people towards someone who's wiser than you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Word of the Lord stands forever...' 1 Peter 1:25 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>'</i><i>Whatev</i><i>er</i><i>...</i><i>God understands you can</i><i>'</i><i>t </i><i>read the Bible</i><i> </i>every<i> day. I</i><i>'</i><i>m busy, I don't have time to do everything as it is. I already believe in Jesus. And I've heard </i><i>'</i><i>the </i><i>G</i><i>ospel</i><i>'</i><i>. Anyway, I read those </i><i>word4U2days</i><i>, so get off my case!</i><i>'</i></p>
<p>This might be the case if we were talking about any other book ever written. The difference is that the Bible is alive and powerful, because God is behind it! It's more than good advice. If you take it seriously and apply it to your life, you will end up happy-not a simple happiness dependant on what sort of a day you're having, but a happiness that's rooted deep in your soul. </p>
<p>God won't love you more because you read the Bible more, but you'll enjoy untold benefits. It's one way that God personally communicates with you. If you just talked at someone but never listened to them, you wouldn't get to know them. Get to know God through reading His message! </p>
<p>If you're just living off a diet of <i>word</i><i>4U2</i><i>d</i><i>ay</i> sandwiches all the time, you won't get to know the taste of the best bit: the filling. Notes, talks and spiritual books are meant to help, but they all take second place. They rotate and centre around God's Word like planets around a sun. If this all sounds a bit heavy and dry, keep reading over the next few days as we keep looking at why the Bible's more than worth it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.' Matthew 24:35 NIV<br /><br /><p>As you dig in to the world's Number One Bestseller, you'll discover the Bible provides the answers to our deepest needs. For example, our need to find love: 'We love because He first loved us.' (1 John 4:19 NIV) Our need to know truth and know God: 'Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.&quot;' (John 14:6 NIV) Our need to find forgiveness: 'What joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven...' (Romans 4:7 NLT) Our need to find peace: 'I have told you all this, so you may have peace in Me...' (John 16:33 NLT) Our need to find freedom: 'So if the Son (Jesus) sets you free, you are truly free.' (John 8:36 NLT) Our need to find joy in life: '...You are extremely happy with joy and praise that can hardly be expressed in words.' (1 Peter 1:8 GWT) Our need for security: '...Nothing can ever separate us from His love. Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away.' (Romans 8:38 NLT) These verses are just a taster of how awesome it is to know God.

<introtext><![CDATA['...A wise person stays calm when insulted.' Proverbs 12:16 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>Your teacher turns to you, stern as stone, and calmly says, </i><i>'</i><i>Can I have a word...</i><i>? </i><i>In my </i><i>office.</i><i>'</i><i> Your mind races. Your brain </i><i>tries to figure</i><i> what you</i><i>'</i><i>ve done wrong. You</i><i>r</i><i> heart</i><i>'</i><i>s like a drum in your ears. They sit you down, and so it begins... </i></p>
<p>No one likes being criticised. It's like a slap in the face. Especially if you don't feel it's deserved. But criticism is a very necessary process to go through if you want to get better. The Bible uses the language of pruningthe trimming process trees are put through so they can keep growing healthily and produce fruit. Even <i>word</i><i>4U2</i><i>d</i><i>ay </i>entries get pruned! We also need pruning. </p>
<p>When it happens, don't think you're getting chopped down! So here are a few safety tips as you head towards the pruning shears: (1) Cling to rational thinking. Don't lose the plot! (2) Check your conscience. Has God been prodding you about the same issue? (3) Consider the critic. Do you trust them? 'Better to be criticised by a wise person than...praised by a fool.' (Ecclesiastes 7:5 NLT) (4) Look for God's purposes in it, no matter what. '...the words of wise people bring healing.' (Proverbs 12:18 GWT)</p>
<p>If you've been left reeling from something someone's said to you ask God to shine light and truth in to your heart so you can step forward and grow healthily.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You...became my partners...' Philippians 4:15 TLB<br /><br /><p>In order that you can turn your dreams into a reality, you're going to need to share it 'from the heart'. You need to tap in to everyone else's passions by first showing where your passions are at. </p>
<p>If people see that what's good for you is good for them too, they'll be champing at the bit. People will follow the dreamer, not necessarily the dream. But if they're sitting there like limp lettuce, it's pretty clear you haven't connected emotionally. When people see that what you've got is more than just a good idea, but could actually benefit <i>them</i>, they'll be well up for it. Frankly, most people do things for their own reasons, not yours. When they see they're on to a winner, you'll have a match made in Heaven. </p>
<p>It's no easy task and some people might still need convincing. This is where patience comes in. However, a word of warning: Don't go pelting ahead, so full of your own ideas and ego that you leave everyone else in meltdown. You'll need to adapt your pace to keep everyone on board. If you run too far ahead, you will lose your followers. Generally, people have to hear an idea at least seven times before they embrace it and call it their own. Ten percent of people are pioneers, 70 percent are settlers and 20 percent are antagonists. Make it your goal to win over the pioneers, to wait for the settlers and to leave the antagonists behind.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God's Kingdom consists of God's approval and peace...' Romans 14:17 GWT<br /><br /><p>You must share your dream visually because only when people 'see it' will they buy into it. People need to actually see what you're on about, or at least some semblance of it before they'll put their metaphorical money where their mouth is. </p>
<p>The thing about dreams is that they're not so great if that's all they ever are. Whether it's transforming a community or creating a new team, it's the impact of your dream that matters. Think about the person you're sharing your dream with, and look at things from their point of view. Are they going to improve themselves? Will they have the rewarding feeling of a job well done? Do they feel valued? Do they like being around you? All these questions matter to people, and if people feel like they don't matter to you, they'll soon be off. If you're already a living breathing example of what you're trying to sell, then a large part of the battle's won. Whether or not they choose to climb aboard will have to do with you-are you a person of integrity? Will you  actually do what you say? </p>
<p>Remember that Jesus Christ was the expert in all these matters, so keep focusing on Him. Even when it's all clicked into place, you might never get a gold star. However you will have that sense of peace and joy that only comes through God's stamp of approval. Is God calling you to step out in faith? Believe Him for His power!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We are God's children.' Romans 8:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>Relatives can sometimes be the hardest nut to crack. We can often get on really well with all sorts of people, but those who are the biggest challenge are often the people closest to us. </p>
<p>The Bible talks about all of us being God's kids. So, by default, that means that if you're a Christian, then you've got a whole load of brothers and sisters in Christ, as well as aunties and uncles, mums and dads and other folk you're related to (whether you like it or not!) If you don't want to end up alone and lonely, learning to get on with people is crucial. Everyone knows you're not perfect and you won't do this all of the time. But that doesn't mean it's ok to not bother. </p>
<p>But God says, 'Do your part to live in peace with everyone... never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God. For it is written, &quot;I will take vengeance; I will repay those who deserve it,&quot; aasays the Lord... Don't let evil get the best of you, but conquer evil by doing good.' (Romans 12:18-21 NLT) <i>'</i><i>Well that</i><i>'</i><i>s easy for you</i><i>,</i><i> God, you</i><i>'</i><i>re Perfect,</i><i>'</i> you might say. God knows everything we struggle with but He doesn't just leave us with the command and say, 'See ya later!' He offers us His power to actually make peaceful relationships a reality.</p>
<p>Spending time praying for someone who you don't naturally get on with is a good way to start building a healthy relationship. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We are all formed by Your hand.' Isaiah 64:8 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Superman or Morph the plasticine man-who would you rather be? The Man of Steel versus a lump of clay. Superman could do just about anything-everything bounced off him and he could stop anything in its tracks. Morph, on the other hand, kept getting remoulded and reshaped, and even splattered into a ball of clay again and again.</p>
<p>It might seem like the answer's obviously Superman, but what if we're wrong? If we look at it from God's point of view, God wants to make, create and shape us into men and women of God. So which is easier to work with: clay or steel? If you're a bit more like steel than playdoh, He'll still be patient with you to do what He has to do. However, it might take more time and effort. It will probably be more painful for you too. Once you're like clay, God can shape you and use you and work with you. When He's done, your desires will start to match up with His desires.</p>
<p>If you look inside yourself (metaphorically, of course) what are those things you desperately want? If you only want recognition, popularity and progress, then you're falling short. Take Jesus: most people thought Jesus came to rule the Jews and sort out the Romans, and yet He ended up dying on a cross. But in doing so He accomplished the will of God.</p>
<p>Being moulded into shape by God is a sign of strength not weakness.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love never fails...' 1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Golden oldies! Don't you just love 'em? You're at the park and there's a sweet little old couple walking hand in hand. He's as doddery as a toddler, and her hair's as grey as smoke. You can tell they've had more games of <i>Scrabble</i> than you've had cooked dinners. </p>
<p>Old couples who've stood the test of time are more than tired old clichés. They're a testimony to the true nature of love. You might think love is that racing feeling when the cutie you've had your eye on walks through the door. However love is really about hanging in there when you want to walk out, forgiving each other and keeping on keeping on. 1 Corinthians 13 might be the famous wedding passage, but we could all do with a reminder so that we can 'love our neighbour as ourselves'. </p>
<p>There are 16 aspects of love that don't bear any resemblance to anything <i>lovey dovey</i>, but are instead very practical. At the top of the list is patience. Could you imagine the difference it would make if you didn't just fly off the handle when your mum shows up late to pick you up. Then there's kindness, and we all love it when someone's done the washing up even when it's not their turn. The final aspect of love is that it never fails. It keeps going. A revival of love might only begin as a small deed, but it could bring on a revolution. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There's poison in this stew!' 2 Kings 4:40 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>There</i><i>'</i><i>s nothing like a bit of outdoor cooking. Trees all around, fire crackling away and a nice bit of stew for the youth group. </i><i>All those tv </i><i>masterchefs and kitchen kings</i><i> would be so proud! Now all it needs are a few </i><i>'</i><i>herbes de provence</i><i>'...</i><i>there we go...</i><i>give </i><i>it a stir and </i><i>'</i><i>voila</i><i>'</i><i>, a beautiful homemade stew </i>à<i> la </i><i>Elisha</i><i>! So, what do you think, </i><i>guys</i><i>? Impressed? </i><i>Hey</i><i>! Don</i><i>'</i><i>t spit it out, it took me ages to make! Wha</i><i>ddy</i><i>a mean it</i><i>'</i><i>s </i><i>revolting</i><i>? Err...</i><i>hang about...</i><i>I</i><i>'</i><i>ll...</i><i>add some...</i><i>some...</i><i> yes, e</i><i>ureka! I</i><i>'</i><i>ll add some flour!</i></p>
<p>And it worked! This was how Elisha dealt with the problem of a poisonous stew. Read it for yourself in 2 Kings 4. By adding flour, it miraculously took away the effect of the poison. God's Word is like flour, because flour is the main ingredient in our number one staple: bread! Jesus said, 'I am the Bread of Life.' (John 6:48 NLT) </p>
<p>Jesus can help us from becoming spiritually ill when we find ourselves in poisonous situations. Don't let disappointments make you cynical. Go to the Word! Starting to feel the snake of resentment wrapping round your heart? Go to the Word! Wound up in a mess which wasn't your making? Go to the Word! And once you've added the Bread of Life, make sure you add seasoning too! 'Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.' (Colossians 4:6 NIV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Be of one mind, united in thought and purpose.' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>'I have a dream!' These words have been made famous by Martin Luther King, Abba and even Westlife. Dreams are important to us, after all, 'who hopes for what he already has?' (Romans 8:24 NIV) But simply having a dream doesn't convert it in to reality. If we don't consider how we can share our dreams with other people, you might find yourself chomping on a big bar of regret by the time you hit retirement. </p>
<p>So let's think about some practical basics: (1) Have you thought it through? Bursting into your pastor's office with all your mates cheering at your back, probably won't sway it for him. Until he believes you've thought it all through, you won't get far. Have you proven yourself to him that you can stick things out when the going gets tough? Don't kid yourself that just because he's a Christian he's bound to say <i>yes</i>. (2) Do you have a plan in place to make it happen? Or are there more unanswered questions than answered? You may be able to recite the whole of Philippians but are you up to the job? Successfully sharing your dream takes skill, practice and God's help. Start ticking these boxes and you're well on your way to living the dream!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all' 1 Thessalonians 5:15 NKJV     <br /><br />VJ Smith writes: 'I don't remember the exact date I met Marty. Like a lot of people...the line I was in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted and I glanced towards the cashier...an affable-looking man in his seventies. ...For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer with the usual, &quot;How's it going?&quot; Then he did something different-he actually listened. ...he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation. I had grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit...I could [reply], &quot;I just found out I have six months to live,&quot; and someone would reply, &quot;Have a great day!&quot; Then...the old cashier walked round to the customers, extended his hand, looked them in the eye and said, &quot;I want to thank you for shopping here today. Have a great day.&quot; The looks on their faces were priceless. There were smiles and sheepish grins. All had been touched by this simple gesture... Some walked away, paused...and looked back...they couldn't quite comprehend what had just happened...I wanted to take him home and feed him cookies!...I'd been in that store a hundred times and never walked away feeling like that.' A marriage counsellor asked a couple to list each other's good qualities. The husband listed twelve. His wife couldn't think of any! The Bible says, 'Look for the best in each other, and always do your best to bring it out.' That's hard to do when you're looking for perfection and focusing on the other person's shortcomings. The Bible says, 'Love...keeps no record of wrongs.' (1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NIV) In other words, look for the best in them!    <br /><br />SoulFood: Jonah 2, Luke 11:29-36<br /><br />word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2012 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=41342&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.' 2 Corinthians 3:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Bring it on! Your time has come! All those hours of cleaning the church toilets actually haven't gone unnoticed! Your youth worker has approached you with the opportunity to do a talk in a couple of month's time to the rest of your youth group! Your chest puffs out, ever so slightly, but not enough for anyone to notice. You borrow concordances, start prepping notes and up the ante in prayer. You cannot wait for the big night! Then, with only a day to go, your pastor calls a meeting saying that God has told him there's a different plan for that night and you're not gonna get to do your talk! You are seething! <i>'</i><i>What?!!</i><i>'</i><i> </i>What a waste! You feel like walking out! But before you blow a gasket, what might God be teaching you through this? </p>
<p>Well, the Bible says: 'Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.' But that liberty (there's the third 'L' and it basically means <i>freedom</i>) happens under Godapproved authority. Freedom doesn't mean doing whatever you want, whenever you want. Part of it means being open to God for a different plan, a different way of doing things. Liberty isn't feeling free enough to do what you want, it's about freeing you up to let God work through you. Take the humble choice, and allow God's Spirit to help you love the people around you.<i> </i>Spend time praying for those who have authority over you, especially church leaders. Ask God to give them wisdom in the decisions they make. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Unless the Lord builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted...' Psalm 127:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>The God-followers in Jeremiah's day thought that they could live however they wanted. With their egotistical, I'm-the-boss-of-me attitude, they thought God would never let them suffer the consequences of their actions. In fact, they thought they were untouchable because God was on their side! But in truth, they ignored God and never listened to Him. To them everything else was more important. Jeremiah cried his eyes out when he realised this. He broke down, seeing just how bad this attitude truly was.</p>
<p>What's important to you? What things have you achieved that you're most proud of? Do you know there is one thing that God wants you to revel in? Better than friendship, romance, perfect health, or even this week's iPhone? It's your relationship with Him. In Jeremiah 9:23-24 NLT, God says, 'Don't let the wise boast in their wisdom, or the powerful boast in their power, or the rich boast in their riches. But those who wish to boast should boast in this alone: that they truly know Me and understand that I am the Lord who demonstrates unfailing love and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth, and that I delight in these things.' </p>
<p>How's your relationship with Jesus? Do you boast that you truly know Him? If not, why not?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God...' 2 Corinthians 1:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Down in the dumps today? Feeling like the world is against you, and even God Himself has got it in for you? Life doesn't always turn out the way we plan or hope, does it? It would be great to have instant power to pass that exam, make that guy fancy us, grow a money tree, stop those bullies, take away the fear, stress, pain, unfairness. But we don't. </p>
<p>When life throws us bitter lemons and dirty ashes, thinking positively and relying on God is often at the bottom of our agenda. It's hard to look forward to tomorrow when everything is a raincloud of doom. How can we believe that God truly loves us when the mess we're in doesn't seem to change? How can we trust God is there for us when it doesn't even feel like He's listening to our prayers? How can we rely on Him to help? After all, He could have kept Joseph out of prison (but didn't), stopped Daniel being thrown into a den of lions (but never did), or made sure Paul wasn't shipwrecked (but it happened anyway). </p>
<p>Take a closer look as to what else happened. As a result of their painful near-death experiences, they got to know God more and the result was that they impacted the world around them. With God, your best moments will often follow the worst times. </p>
<p>Take strength from 1 Peter 4:12-13 and memorise God's promise to you: <i>'</i><i>And we know that God causes every</i><i>thing to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.</i><i>'</i><i> </i>(Romans 8:28 NIV)</p>

<p><em>'</em><em>It</em><em>'</em><em>s all right,</em><em> it</em><em>'</em><em>s just a little bit of dirt. It</em><em>'</em><em>s not a detergent ad! No one</em><em>'</em><em>s expecting it to be whiter</em><em>-</em><em>than</em><em>-</em><em>white</em><em>'</em><em>, are they?</em><em>'</em><em> </em></p>
<p>This may be your attitude towards your clothes, but is it also your attitude towards sin? Just like your mum can spot the tiniest of blemishes on your outfit, God sees everything. When you sin, own up to it. 'If we say openly that we have done wrong, He is upright and true to His word, giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil.' (1 John 1:9 BBE)</p>
<p>'Yeah, but I keep doing it, I keep thinking it. Isn't God going to stop forgiving me?' When Jesus told Peter to forgive his brother seventy times seven, that's a picture of how God will deal with us. God won't even write us off after the four hundred and ninety-first time either!</p>
<p>When you stuff up, own up to it and turn again to Jesus. If your heart races at the thought of the wrong you've done, then give God thanks your conscience is still sensitive and responsive to His Spirit. Washing powder cleans your clothes but it's God's fire that cleans our insides. And when you've confessed your sin to Him, don't be down on yourself. Instead be confident that Jesus' sacrifice is enough for you to walk with God confidently once more.</p>
<p>You're not a loser, you're a learner.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Troublemakers listen to troublemakers...' Proverbs 17:4 CEV <br /><br /><p>A conversation involving malicious chatter or rumours about other people-that's gossip. But, oh how tasty it can be! A quick status change here, a sneaky text there as well as lunchtime chatter and banter. Then of course there are the gossip columns, magazines and even TV and radio programmes spouting it out. It's hard to keep away from it. </p>
<p>A person who habitually spreads intimate or private rumours or facts-that's a gossiper. Not really something we'd want on our CV, is it? That's because deep down, we know gossip for what it is. A weapon of mass social destruction, designed to break and tear down an individual, friendship group or community. The moment somebody begins to gossip, stop them and ask, 'Why do I need to know this? Have you talked to the person you're talking about?' Wise up; people who gossip can't be trusted!</p>
<p>What does the Bible say about dealing with gossip? 'The words of a gossip are like tasty bits of food; people like to gobble them up.' (Proverbs 26:22 NCV) 'A gossip can never keep a secret. Stay away from people who talk too much.' (Proverbs 20:19 NIV) 'If a ruler listens to falsehood, all his officials will be wicked.' (Proverbs 29:12 ESV) 'Without wood a fire goes out, and without gossip a quarrel dies down.' (Proverbs 26:20 GWT) </p>
<p>God's Word speaks the truth, so get rid of gossip before it weaves itself into the fabric of your everyday speech. '...stop making false accusations and spreading vicious rumours! ...Then your light will shine out from the darkness, and the darkness around you will be as bright as day.' (Isaiah 58:9-10 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle...' Matthew 12:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>Back in Jesus' day, kids would make musical pipes to play with from reeds growing by the river. They'd hollow them out, bore in holes and make tunes. But just like toys today, over time they get battered, bruised and thrown away. Have you ever felt like that? Life was once fresh and good, but then hurtful words or your own failure left you battered and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Remember candles on a birthday cake when you were a kid. Fun for a moment, but once blown out, useless and quickly discarded. Maybe you once felt on fire for God, but then the chilly wind of unforgiveness or injustice extinguished it all.</p>
<p>What do all these people have in common: A woman trembling before an angry mob threatening to stone her to death? A house surrounded by people and a paralysed man on a stretcher; his friends not giving up until they get him through the crowd to Christ? A blind man crying out for his sight and disciples telling him to be quiet? They are all bruised reeds and smouldering wicks that Jesus reached out to restore. The world thinks it knows what to do with you-break you off and snuff you out! But not Jesus: 'He does not crush the weak, or quench the smallest hope.' (Matthew 12:20 TLB) No matter how spent or used you feel, God's still got you! Come, He will treat you gently and make you whole. He'll never chuck you out with the rubbish or snub you out. Talk to Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...will never leave you nor forsake you.' Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Loneliness is 'an unpleasant feeling in which a person experiences a strong sense of emptiness and solitude resulting from inadequate levels of social relationships' according to Wikipedia. Right back at the very beginning of creation God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone...' (Genesis 2:18 NIV) That's true: God created us to enjoy friendship and community.</p>
<p>Being alone and being lonely are two different things. It's possible to be by yourself and not feel lonely and it's possible to feel lonely in a crowded room. This is because loneliness is a state of mind, an emotion brought on through relationship breakdown. If we become a forgotten friend, an ex, or the black sheep of the family, we can feel incredibly lonely. A lack of good relationships in our life can leave us in desperation feeling worthless, unwanted and not needed. There is no deeper sadness than the idea that we do not have a friend, that no one cares about us, that no one is concerned about anything that might happen to us, that no one would even care if we weren't around.</p>
<p>There is only one true cure for deep loneliness: understanding who God is. He calls Himself your 'Heavenly Father,' not just your creator and designer. When Jesus taught us to pray He didn't begin with 'O, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God.' Yes, God is all of those, but when it comes to us, He wants to be recognised and called 'Father' (Matthew 6:9). That's how He thinks about us, and wants us to think and to feel about Him. </p>
<p>He's your loving, secure, accepting, concerned, compassionate, protecting, assuring, providing Father-when you grasp the truth of that you will begin to overcome the fear of loneliness.<i> </i></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Nothing can ever separate [me] from God's love...' Romans 8:38 NLT<br /><br /><p>'Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely...' wrote David in Psalm 25:16. Loneliness, that awful feeling of desolation and emptiness, is something that mankind has been experiencing for millennia. When David felt it, he didn't hold back-he told God everything, 'Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.' (Psalm 142:4 NIV) Job felt so misunderstood and rejected by his friends, he told God, 'I despise my life...my days have no meaning.' (Job 7:16 NIV) Elijah became consumed with loneliness and prayed that he might die, '...I have had enough, Lord...Take my life...' (1 Kings 19:4 NIV) </p>
<p>Because of his isolation, Jeremiah told God, 'Cursed be the day I was born...Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow...?' (Jeremiah 20:14-18 NIV) Wrapped up in their isolated state, each of them prayed big bold real prayers, and get this: God never barked back at them to be quiet. He never told them off for being silly. He never shouted, 'Pull yourself together!' God loved them, understood them and listened to their emotional pain. </p>
<p>When we are overcome with loneliness, we too need to turn to the real cure. God is the only who truly gets us, understands what we're going through and can help us overcome feeling forgotten. </p>
<p>If you're feeling like this, express it in writing a song or poem, just like David did in the Psalms. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then David got up...' 2 Samuel 12:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>David committed adultery with another man's wife, got her pregnant, then arranged to have her husband put to death in an attempt to cover it up. Then he married her and thought everything would be ok. But the child became critically ill. Desperately wanting to save the baby's life, David '...fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground. The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food...' In spite of all his praying, the child died. Why did God let this happen? We don't have a clear answer. But this much we know: when you have repented of your sin and experienced God's forgiveness, you must get up and go on with your life. David made earthshaking mistakes but we can discover three important things in this story: (1) Until you are willing to make things right with God and those you've hurt, you can't go forward with confidence. (2) Until you process your emotions in a healthy way, whether guilt or grief, you will remain stuck and forfeit the joy of what God has for you next. (3) When you've done these two things, get up and get on with your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow Me, and I will make you...' Mark 1:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Every year thousands join the long lines queuing for their chance at stardom, each one hoping they have <i>The X Factor</i>. They're prepared to do whatever it takes to prove they're 'the next big thing' in the entertainment world. Each one nervously awaits the approval of the judges. They long to scream down the phone, 'I made it through to the next round!' </p>
<p>Many fall at the first hurdle, some having been laughed (others man-handled) off stage, feeling intense disappointment. The nearer the hopefuls get to the finishing line the harder they fall, knowing they never made it. </p>
<p>Jesus says, 'Follow Me, and I will make you...' We all want to be 'a somebody' and Jesus promises when you follow Him, 'He will make you.' But we wonder if He'll leave us standing in line, kick us off boot camp or turf us from His house. Listen: Following God is like stepping out on tissue paper and discovering solid rock underneath. But you'll never discover the rock unless you're willing to step onto the tissue paper!</p>
<p><i>Here</i><i>'</i><i>s a promise to </i><i>sustain you</i>. '...do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:9 NIV)</p>

When we hear that 'certain name' we get a buzz of excitement. We spend big bucks to check out their latest film or attend their next concert. We may even queue for hours to catch just a glimpse of them. </p>
<p>Some people can make us starry-eyed. But can you imagine someone's introduction leaving people <i>horizontal</i>? That's exactly what happened to a whole group of men. They went seeking out the 'man of the moment', the guy everybody wanted to meet. And when they finally caught up with him, the guy introduced himself and they all fell flat on their faces! The men were trained, tough soldiers and the man was Jesus. They were seeking to arrest Him-they were the best of the regiment, armed and dangerous but, by simply stating who He was, He sent these guys tumbling. Go check it out in John 18:2-6. </p>
<p>Philippians 2:10 NLT tells us; '...at the name of Jesus every knee should bow'-and if they don't today, they will someday soon.</p>
<p>Celebrities come and go but the bedrock of our faith is still Christ's virgin birth, His sinless life, His atoning death, His victorious resurrection, His work of mediation and His visible return as King of Kings. Christ-there's no one like Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We do not know what to do, but we are looking to You for help.' 2 Chronicles 20:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Every day we have millions of choices to make: what time to get up, what to have for breakfast, what to put on our Facebook status? Some choices are easier than others and we can make a quick decision without a thought. But other times they seem nothing less than a mini-crisis! Running around like a headless chook or burying your head in the sand, hoping it'll go away will ensure things get worse, not better.</p>
<p>King Jehoshaphat faced a crisis. The Moabites and Ammonites were massing their troops in preparation for an all-out assault on Judah. Jehoshaphat had every right to be afraid, withdrawn, worried and indecisive. But instead he led the way for us all in how to handle a crisis moment. Jehoshaphat called all the people together to ask God for help, a day of prayer for everyone: 'All the men of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, wives and children.' (2 Chronicles 20:13 NLT) It was a prayer meeting involving every member of the family. When stuck in a crisis, not knowing what to do, Jehoshaphat prayed, 'We do not know what to do, but we are looking to You for help.' And we need to do the same.</p>
<p>Meeting up with your friends or family to pray together about the things each of you need help with is still a good idea today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go...' Joshua 1:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Starting a new school, heading off for college, moving to a university, beginning a new job-these are times when decisions get trickier. We're in new territory, covering unknown ground. Situations like these can make us anxious because fear of the unknown creeps into every choice we make.</p>
<p>Joshua knew exactly what that felt like. After living in the wilderness for forty years, God asked him to step out into a new place. His leader Moses had died and Joshua had no one around who knew how to help him or what to do. Every day brought a new unknown, a new experience, a new obstacle to overcome. How would he get through this? </p>
<p>God takes him aside for a chat and reminds him: '...Be strong and courageous, for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them... Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you... Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do... Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:5-9 NLT) As a leader you will always be uncertain about many things, especially when you go into new territory. But you can never afford to be unclear or in doubt about your calling, your vision, and your ultimate victory. And where does such confidence come from? God's promise, 'I am with you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will instruct you...in the way you should go; I will guide you...' Psalm 32:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>One reason we can find it difficult making a decision is because we're frightened of failure, scared we'll get it wrong and make a fool out of ourselves. We need to remember that just because we may fail sometimes; it doesn't make us a failure. Thomas Edison is believed to have had tried at least 50,000 experiments before he successfully invented the storage battery: that's at least 49,999 failed experiments! How did he keep on going without seeing any results? When he was asked about it, Edison said, 'Results? Why, I know 50,000 things that won't work.'</p>
<p>When the choices we make don't produce hoped-for results, we can learn from them to make better decisions in the future. This doesn't mean we don't need to put any thought or effort into decisions we make. Choices always come with consequences, so they matter! It's important we recognise that we won't make good decisions simply by flipping a coin.</p>
<p>The Bible contains the very thoughts of the One who created us and knows everything about us, everything about life. In order to make consistently right choices we need to know what it says and apply it in our life. Most of all we need to chat on a regular basis to the Author because, 'The Lord says, &quot;I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I will advise you and watch over you.&quot;' (Psalm 32:8 NLT)</p>
<p>How about buying a Bible commentary to use alongside your Bible study! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We have seen His glory...' John 1:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Gospel Truth. We hear that phrase loads of times, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>First up, let's look at Truth. Truth is not just the idea of fact over fiction; Truth is not just words or beliefs; Truth is not just an individual viewpoint. Truth can be seen from many angles, but Truth, in essence, is one Man-Jesus.</p>
<p>The four Gospels-Matthew, Mark, Luke and John-can be read individually, but to get an accurate picture of Jesus we should read all four in relation to each other. The beauty of this is that each Gospel looks at different aspects of Jesus, His works, His personality and His teachings. They all complement each other by looking at a different side of Truth. They do not argue against each other, but they build each other up. They do not fight against each other, but together they complete the story of God-in-the-form-of-man.</p>
<p>The ones who wrote the Gospels saw Jesus' glory when He came to earth, and they have written so <i>we</i> can also see His glory!</p>
<p>When did you last read all four Gospels? Now is a good time!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...as though you were working for the Lord...' Colossians 3:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>Riots, looting and arson attacks happened on a mammoth scale across England in early August 2011. Holidaying politicians were called back to work and police annual leave was suspended until law and order was restored. In later news reports, approximately 3100 people had been arrested and a thousand charged; five people had died and 16 others were injured. The cost of damage to property was believed to be $300 million. </p>
<p>It all started out as a peaceful protest march after the tragic fatal shooting of a young man by police officers. The march was joined by a younger group of people, angry and armed. As the shouting escalated, violence broke out and the horrific scenes began. </p>
<p>When we don't respect our leaders we get anarchy, total chaos and everyone suffers. It is said, that until you learn to take orders you will never be qualified to give them. Jesus knew more than any other human being, yet even He respected the authority of the government in power. How much more then should we? Don't go talking down those who have authority over you. Ok, they're not perfect. But if you want to be treated with respect, you first have to respect others, even those you don't agree with or even like. Whatever you do or say, give it out '...as though you were working for the Lord...'</p>
<p>Even when you disagree with some of the opinions or actions of your leaders, you can find ways to encourage and show respect to them.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['There is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.' Romans 8:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>Are you spending too much time beating yourself up? If so, it's time to stop! In a series of talks entitled <i>Beauty for Ashes</i>, Christian speaker Joyce Meyer says: 'Don't waste time on things that produce nothing good in your life. Stop doing things that don't help you progress.' For many reasons we can think badly about ourselves. Guilt, anger and shame are just a few. Joyce compares them to living life in a rocking chair: 'The thoughts will keep you busy, tire you out, but get you nowhere! You'll go through life, simply rocking back and forth in your own misery.' </p>
<p>God doesn't want you to feel bad about yourself and confession deals with it. 1 John 1:9 NLT says, 'If we confess our sins to Him, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.' God promises that when we ask for forgiveness, 'I'll wipe the slate clean for each of them. I'll forget they ever sinned!' Forgiveness comes by faith, not feelings. As long as you live by feelings, Satan has a weapon he can use against you at every turn. But as long as you truly repent, whatever you have done is pardonable. Once God has forgotten it, it's gone, so how can you still feel guilty about something that doesn't exist? We may feel like we're condemned, but we need to start living like we're not: 'There is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.' If you belong to Christ Jesus then that's you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Building yourselves up on your...faith...' Jude 1:20 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you're intentional about it, your faith will grow. If you're lazy, it won't! It's that simple. Like a river erodes a riverbank, your faith can wear away just from living every day. If you don't do anything to secure and strengthen your faith, it will begin to deteriorate-and you can count on that! Hebrews 11:6 NIV tells us that, 'Without faith it is impossible to please God,' so living by faith needs to be the top of our daily agenda. 'Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.' (Hebrews 11:1 NIV) It's being Godconfident: relying on God to guide you through life.</p>
<p>Henry Blackaby wrote: 'The kind of assignments God gives in the Bible are always God-sized. They are always beyond what people can do, because He wants to demonstrate His nature, His strength, His provision and His kindness to His people and to a watching world. That is the only way the world will come to know Him.'</p>
<p>God wants us to do things for Him that we can only do with His help, because only then will we experience God at work in our lives, only then will people see how great God is. Live by faith, take on God-sized jobs and God-sized challenges-do something that you can only accomplish with God's help.</p>
<p>Remember, your faith is like a muscle; if you don't exercise it consistently it will grow weak and powerless. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Building yourselves up on your...faith...' Jude 1:20 NKJ<br /><br /><p>A surprising number of people go to church each week just to get a word to help them survive. They sing about faith but when you ask them, 'How are you doing?' they say, 'I'm just hanging on. I'm hoping to make it through.' If you feel like this, you need to be careful about spiritual infection. It's the contagious type of disease that weakens and waters down God's words, bringing doubts, wrong thought patterns and a misguided way to live. We need to avoid catching such infections and spreading them.</p>
<p>Jude, the brother of James (and possibly the brother of Jesus) was so bothered about this that he wrote a fiery letter to the church, telling them to watch out for them and fight against them. The danger is very real: there are false teachers and deceivers out there. They live pleasing themselves and encourage others to do the same. We need to live differently, Jude says: 'But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit. Keep yourselves in God's love...' (Jude 1:20-21 NIV)</p>
<p>Don't rely solely on what others say about the Bible, discover it for yourself. Let's encourage each other to live right and keep spiritual infections out of the church. Read your Bible and make a point of sharing what you discover with your friends.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord God put the man in the Garden...to take care of it and to look after it.' Genesis 2:15 CEV<br /><br /><p>If you're still living with your family, how do you treat your home? Do you think drop your mucky trainers in the kitchen, tip your dirty washing on the bathroom floor and leave ten mouldy mugs under your bed? What about the people whose house it is-the ones who've made it a home and allowed you to live there? It's only fair you look after the place, right?</p>
<p>Psalm 8:6-8 NLT says God 'gave [us] charge of everything [He] made, putting all things under [their] authority...the flocks...herds...all the wild animals...birds...fish...everything.' Does that mean we can treat it however we like? Trash the place, leave it wrecked, broken and desolate? No, when God made us, He gave us the earth 'to take care of it and to look after it.' Are you doing what you can to keep God's place tidy? </p>
<p>We're not talking tree-hugging here, but there are plenty of things we can all do to make this world a better place. Like recycling, being careful with your rubbish, sponsoring a child in a third world country, logging on to opendoors.org.au to see what you can do to help persecuted Christians, for instance. Will you look after what God has given you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They didn't even smell of smoke!' Daniel 3:27 NLT<br /><br /><p>We can't blame the devil for everything that goes wrong (we have to take responsibility for our actions) but we do need to remember that he's real and hanging around. 1 Peter 5:8 NLT says, 'Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.' Don't freak out about that, though1 John 4:4 NLT tells us: '...You have already won your fight...because the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world.' As James 4:7 KJV says all we need to do is: 'Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.' </p>
<p>Have you read about those three guys who God <i>literally</i> delivered from the flames? They lived in a time like ours, where most people think more about themselves than they do about God. They were given a horrendous death penalty, to be burnt alive simply for believing in God. Thrown into the hottest furnace in the kingdom, they came out alive, without a scorch mark anywhere: 'They didn't even smell of smoke!' Their names are oddsounding today-Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego-but they'll always be remembered by history, their lives publicly announcing: <i>The devil </i><i>may want to destroy you but God is here to deliver you.</i></p>
<p>You can read Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego's story in Daniel 3 and be inspired by the God who delivers us from danger.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Hezekiah...spread it out before the Lord...' 2 Kings 19:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>The sound of screeching tyres, a court date, a lump-bad news comes in all shapes and disguises. For Hezekiah it came in the form of a letter. Devastating news that left him in a hopeless situation. Bad news is no respecter of age, class or gender and can hit us at any time. So what should we do when it reaches us? How do we problem solve? We could hardly do better than to adopt the Hezekiah approach.</p>
<p>Hezekiah's bad news: a massive all-conquering Assyrian army was marching his way to wipe him and his city out! Straight away, 'After Hezekiah received the letter and read it, he...spread it out before the Lord. <b>&quot;</b>Listen to me, O Lord, and hear! ...rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that You alone, O Lord, are God.&quot; And this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria: &quot;His armies will not enter Jerusalem... I will defend it.&quot;' (2 Kings 19:14-34 NLT) God kept His promise: 'That night the angel of the Lord went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian troops. When the surviving Assyrians bbwoke up the next morning, they found corpses everywhere.' (2 Kings 19:35 NLT)</p>
<p>Hezekiah was a man of faith (2 Kings 18:5) and prayer. His first reaction when confronted with bad news was to bring it before God. Whether the problem was 185,000 armed and dangerous Assyrians or a painful illness (2 Kings 20:1-7), Hezekiah took it to the Lord in prayer. And when he prayed, things happened. </p>
<p>We should still deal with our problems or bad news the Hezekiah way: take them to God today!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Hezekiah...spread it out before the Lord...' 2 Kings 19:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's another response to crisis, and it isn't the Hezekiah approach of yesterday's reading. It's the drama queen tactic! Ever met one? They take the smallest thing and blow it out of all proportion, bursting eardrums with their screams and soaking whole boxes of tissues with their tears. They leave their friends frustrated wanting them to sit down, calm down and just breathe. Hassle, stress, crises and problems are sadly part and parcel of life. (It's not until we get to Heaven that they'll disappear. Check out what's coming your way in Revelation 21). </p>
<p>Honoré de Balzac said: 'In times of crisis<b>,</b> the heart either breaks or boldens.' God wants you to toughen up, not break up. The best way to do that is to let God in on the action straightaway. If we don't, we can overreact. And this means we spend time making the problem worse. Instead of rushing around trying to fix everything ourselves, we need to leave room for God to help. God's not going to step in if you're busy doing it all yourself. He won't step in when He's not welcome. You need to ask for His help. God is the best problem-solver there is and He wants to teach you how to become good at it too. Will you let Him?</p>
<p>There is value in talking to someone you trust, who you know handles a crisis well. Ask them how they keep cool under pressure and learn from them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Abraham never doubted or questioned God's promise.' Romans 4:20 CEV<br /><br /><p>A car might have a new engine, great body work, smartlooking interior...but with no fuel in the tank, no one's going to expect it to get very far. It's the fuel that allows it to reach its destination. If we want to get ahead in life, we need to spend less time on our outward appearance. We need to be more concerned with what's going on inside, making sure the tank of our lives is constantly topped up with the right fuel.</p>
<p>Life often doesn't turn out as we think it will; our plans sometimes fail, we don't always achieve or receive the things we wanted. So how do we keep going through disappointment and confusion? Hebrews 11:1 NLT tells us what makes life worth living is having faith in God: 'Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we cannot see.'</p>
<p>Abraham reached a point in life where the odds were incredibly stacked against him. But he never lost hope, never gave up, he kept going. Why? Because he was full of faith in God: 'Abraham never doubted or questioned God's promise. His faith made him strong, and he gave all the credit to God. Abraham was certain that God could do what He had promised.' (Romans 4:20-21 CEV)</p>
<p>We can be certain too. Don't worry about the odds, be fuelled by faith.</p>
<p>Have a scan of Abraham's life story in Genesis 15-21 and then see what the New Testament writers say about him in Romans 4 and Hebrews 11:8-10.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...May I never forget the good things He does for me.' Psalm 103:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Do you feel the world owes you something? Do you walk around, moaning, 'I don't believe it,' about everything? Do you live your life thinking, 'if only'? 'If only I had this, if only I could do that, if only I wasn't born here, if only that didn't happen to me?' Are you grumbling your way through life and feeling hard done by? </p>
<p>Did you know if you close one eye and hold a dollar close enough to your other eye you can block out the light of the sun? The sunshine doesn't disappear, we just can't see it, all we can see is the dark face of the dollar. When you feel as if life only serves up misery, it's time to shift your focus! Lamentations 3:22-23 NCV is the focus shift in a book of deep pain. 'The Lord's love never ends; His mercies never stop. They are new every morning; Lord, Your loyalty is great.' Focus on all the good things God gives you every day; 'May I never forget the good things He does for me.'</p>
<p>Changing your computer password or the welcome message on your mobile to a promise of God will help shift your focus to an attitude of gratitude.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let's not get tired of doing what is good...' Galatians 6:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Take your average tube of toothpaste and you will see that it is jampacked with potential. Potential to keep those pearly whites of yours from becoming deep black cavities and your gorgeous gums from becoming a bleeding mess! There on the back is displayed a list of all the good stuff it contains with instructions as to the best way to use it. Yes indeed, your average tube of toothpaste has the potential to make your visits to the dentist a genuine journey of joy, rather than a torturous trip of terror.</p>
<p>However, if all you ever do is leave the cap of that toothpaste tube firmly shut and the tube languishing at the back of your bathroom cabinet, then all that potential goes to waste. Potential has to be used for it to produce anything good. And it has to be used regularly, not just a oneoff. You need to open that toothpaste top, release all that toothpaste potential on to a toothbrush and brush at least twice a day in order to receive its benefits and unlock all that potential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you are packed with potential to do much good: 'We are...created...to do good works...' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV) So no more hiding that potential away, rather let your potential run free. Today, take those opportunities to demonstrate love, or to choose to be selfdisciplined. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let's not get tired of doing what is good...' Galatians 6:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's a legend about a soldier being court-martialled before Alexander the Great. Thinking it was all a case of mistaken identity, the soldier asked to appeal it. The conqueror informed him that there was no one he could plead his case to who was higher than him. 'In that case,' the soldier replied, 'I appeal my case from Alexander the Small, to Alexander the Great!' </p>
<p>In each of us there is a lesser self and a greater self struggling for supremacy. Your lesser self says, 'Not enough people believe in me. I'll never make it!' Your greater self says, 'My faith in God and His power in me is enough; I can make it.' Your lesser self says, 'It's taking too long!' Your greater self says, 'Dreams are realised one day at a time.' Your lesser self says, 'Enough is enough! I've taken too many smack-downs.' Your greater self says, 'I've come too far to give up now.' Your lesser self says, 'I don't have the strength to hold on...' Your greater self says, 'Keep on keeping on! You'll look back and wonder why you ever doubted.' After being shipwrecked, stoned, imprisoned, betrayed, hungry, thirsty, sleepless, cold and naked, Paul found it within himself to keep going. (2 Corinthians 11:24-12:5) Where does <i>that</i> kind of strength come from? God! The assignment God gives you will never be greater than the grace He provides. So draw on His strength, fight through for God and with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others...' Ephesians 4:31 CEV<br /><br /><p>When it comes to anger and bitterness, here are two things you need to keep in mind: <i>First, it is contagious.</i> You are a part of the body of Christ. So what happens to you, and in you, affects those you are connected to both positively and negatively. The Bible says, 'If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honoured, every part rejoices with it.' (1 Corinthians 12:26 NIV) A snake bite doesn't just affect the body part that gets bitten; the venom spreads through the whole body. 'See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.' (Hebrews 12:15 NIV) Don't get upset and leave the church God has placed you in. You need them and they need you. <i>Secondly, it can be overcome</i>. Here's how: (a) Acknowledge and admit it. (b) Don't rehearse it in your mind or recite it to others. (c) Repent and get rid of any attitude that's not Christ-like. (d) Ask God to give you self-control, and submit to His leadership. (e) Don't infect others and don't let them infect you. (f) Without waiting for admissions or apologies, say to yourself, God and a trusted friend, your decision to forgive all wrongs against you. 'Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.' (Ephesians 4:32 NIV) This will set you free to enjoy your relationship with God, yourself, and others. (g) Look for practical ways to 'be kind...[and] tenderhearted' toward those who hurt you. (Ephesians 4:32 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your words...were my joy and my heart's delight...' Jeremiah 15:16 NIV <br /><br /><p>Someone who says, 'If you really love God and walk according to His Word you will never get depressed,' has clearly never read the Scriptures and never been depressed! Elijah called down fire from heaven in a spectacular victory, yet he became so depressed in the aftermath that he wanted to die. '...It is enough! Now, Lord, take my life...' (1 Kings 19:4 NKJV) That's a big-time low!</p>
<p>Being a Christian does not mean you've been given a jab immunising you against the viruses of life. When you try to act super-spiritual and allow people to think you never battle in areas like fear, failure, finances, family or feelings, you're living in on another planet! But when you bring the real you before God, you not only free yourself up for Him to do His work in you, you also show everyone else you're real and no Super-Christian. </p>
<p>God knows exactly what you're going through. So let's get real with Him. You are never more effective than when you are transparent. And Jesus has promised: '...in Me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. But take courage; I have conquered the world!' (John 16:33 NRS)</p>
<p>Is there a particular issue you're struggling with at the moment? Tell God all about it. Vent. Rant, if you have to. And when you've told Him everything, ask Him what He has to say. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We will receive...grace to help us when we need it.' Hebrews 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>'</i><i>You deserve this. In fact, you</i><i>'</i><i>ve earned it...</i><i>No one has to know. It</i><i>'</i><i>s not harming anyone</i><i>,</i><i> is it? Just this once will make everything feel so much better! It</i><i>'</i><i>s just a bit of fun.

<p>These are the kind of things Satan will whisper to you. Whether it's pornography, alcohol or an eating disorder, your brain will seduce you with a logical argument. Then it'll invite you to have a taste of the forbidden fruit. Whether you're fourteen or forty, temptation can strike at any time. </p>
<p>'<i>But it</i><i>'</i><i>s hard, isn</i><i>'</i><i>t it? That</i><i>'</i><i>s why it</i><i>'</i><i>s called temptation! I don</i><i>'</i><i>t know what to do!</i><i>'</i><i> </i>Well, first off, be honest with yourself. When exactly are you most likely to be tempted? Are stress levels rising? Feeling hurt, angry, bored, worried, alone, think you deserve 'a reward'? Work out what the patterns are of your temptation. 'God's people...protect themselves by watching where they go.' (Proverbs 16:17 CEV) Secondly, go to God in prayer: 'Call on Me when you are in trouble, and I will rescue you...' (Psalm 50:15 NLT) God's not given up on you, '...So let us come boldly to the throne of our most gracious God. There we will...find grace to help us when we need it most.' (Hebrews 4:16 NLT)</p>
<p>Temptation is hardest to resist when you think 'no one will know'. Many people have an accountability buddysomeone spiritually mature that you know and trust who has your permission to ask you anythingyes, <i>anything</i>!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your life is shaped by your thoughts.' Proverbs 4:23 GNT<br /><br /><p>After reading yesterday's notes, it may have sounded like it's all cut and dried: recognise when you're tempted, ask for God's help and He'll come through for you. Job done! But we all know that beating temptation is nowhere near as simple as that. </p>
<p>Simply repeating, 'I won't go on those websites, I won't go on those websites!' just won't cut it. Before you know it, you're back in a pool of shame eating a big slice of regret. So what do you do? Well, the battleground is your mind. Trying to fight the thought of not doing something just feeds the idea until it grows so big, it's the only thing you can think of. The answer? <i>Replace</i> your thoughts.</p>
<p>Once you focus is on something good, the dross begins to lose its grip. Positively distract yourself, '...Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honourable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise.' (Philippians 4:8 NLT) This is more than a nice verse in the Bible, it's the key to overcoming temptation. The wisdom of Solomon states: 'Your life is shaped by your thoughts.' Mind management is massive for moving mountains. Yes, it might take time, practice and God's help. However God is all about achieving the impossible.</p>
<p>The Psalmist prayed, 'Keep me from paying attention to what is worthless...' (Psalm 119:37 GNT) Is this easy to do? No, it takes discipline and practice. But with time, and God's grace, you can change the way you think and overcome temptation.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God is no respecter of persons.' Acts 10:34 KJV<br /><br /><p>Prejudice is the product of a lazy mind. It's contempt, prior to investigation. Your first impression of someone is incomplete and often inaccurate. Don't assume your first impression is right. Don't make lasting decisions based on limited insights. Your success in life will be limited by prejudice, fear and any form of discrimination you allow to colour your thinking. Jesus never measured a person's worth based on their race, gender, financial status or appearance. He was comfortable in the presence of fishermen and tax collectors. He was at ease with the rich and the poor. He knew that every person He met had potential and He never looked down on them because of their past. Born to a mother who conceived Him as a virgin, He knew what it meant to have a questionable background and be subject to the rumour mill. But He rose above it. And He broke tradition. The Samaritans were considered such a lower class of people that Jews wouldn't talk to them. But Jesus did. In fact, He went out of His way to meet with a five-times-married Samaritan woman, discussing the mysteries of worship with her and changing her life. Peter struggled with prejudice yet, once God dealt with his bias, was called to introduce the Gospel to the first group of Gentiles. He had obviously figured it out when he said, 'I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.' If 'God so loved the world' but you don't, how can you claim to be 'godly'?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' Luke 5:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about getting serious with God, you can almost guarantee one of the battles you'll face is with hurry. In the world we live in, there tends to be two types of people: those who can be bothered, and those who can't. Those who <i>can</i><i>'</i><i>t</i> suffer from apathy and those who <i>can</i> are usually so focussed on fighting apathy that everything has to be done at warp speed. While this supersonic way of living starts to get the job done, the pitfalls are normally as follows: (a) you get worn out (b) you get frustrated at what seems like apathy from anyone going slower than you (c) you become so focussed on getting the job done you actually forget to have a relationship with God! </p>
<p>Nobody was in more demand than Jesus but He always knew that there was a time for hurry and a time for rest. Have you ever noticed that despite living a hectic lifestyle Jesus never got stressed out? </p>
<p>The truth is, as much as we complain about it, we love hurry. It keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes us feel important. Jesus never hurried. He had time for people, His diary was flexible. Nothing was so important that He couldn't change His plans for someone. And what's the secret? Solitude. Jesus took time out, away from busyness to be with His Father. </p>
<p>Why not take out your diary and book in some time for God and give it the highest priority this week. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach us to make the most of our time, so that we may grow in wisdom.' Psalm 90:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Often we get very distracted worrying about things we have no control over. Worrying about the past is a waste of timewe should learn from the past and plan for the future. The Bible teaches us <i>we reap what we sow </i>which basically means if we work hard and are deliberate about what we're doing, our future will reflect that. If you spend your time sitting around watching TV, don't expect to do much with your life. Did you ever get given a presentation project in school? Remember the model bridge? The idea is for a bridge to hold as much weight as possible. The kids who messed around had two tubes and a piece of paper that couldn't hold anything. But those kids who put the time in, worked hard and thought through the science had bridges that could hold all the weights. </p>
<p>In order to plan for the future you need two things<b>Decision</b> and <b>D</b><b>iscipline</b>. (No point in making a decision unless you have the discipline to follow through!) Decide what God has called you to achieve and work until you get there! Some of us never admit that things go wrong because we didn't prepare properly. Some people give up early and others even decide not to do what's right! We know we shouldn't, but we give in to temptation. Good decisions aren't normally easy but they are essential if you want to be successful. </p>
<p>Plan to make today a masterpiece! Pray to God to give you the discipline to achieve the dream He's given you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love the Lord your God with all your heart...' Deuteronomy 6:5 INV<br /><br /><p>Are you the same person at home, at work, with your mates and at church? Does your language 'loosen' up a bit when you're with your mates? Would you be comfortable if your pastor sat with you through the movies you choose? We're all good at playing the part; saying and doing the right things in right places. Sometimes we put on an act because we are afraid that if our real personality was on show people would walk out rather than applaud. Know this-your life is like a stage and loads of people may come in and out and watch for a while; but there is one person who remains a constant observer-Jesus. You should live your life performing for <i>an audience of One</i>. No one else's opinion matters. God doesn't see your life as a collection of separate performances. He sees you as oneas a whole person. The person you are when no one's looking is just the same to Him as the person you are when you're standing in plain view. </p>
<p>God asks for integrity (wholeness) in our lives. Why? Because it doesn't work any other way! He made us with one will, one mind, one heart and one spirit. It's Satan's lie that <i>'</i><i>we can have it both ways</i><i>'</i> which leaves us fractured and paralysed. What's the answer? 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.' (Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV) 'All' means all! One person, one life, one show!</p>
<p>Remember, God made you and loves you. You don't have to prove anything to anyoneyou just need to love God the Deuteronomy 6:5 way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Their loyalty is divided between God and the world...' James 1:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Ever been called <i>a </i><i>control</i><i> freak</i>? Some people aren't happy unless they have everything under their controland that's not what God wants. If you've got a tendency to try to control situations or people just to get your own way, there's something wrong. Ever noticed that the more you try to control, the more anxiety you feel? </p>
<p>The Bible says, '...the mind of the flesh [which is sense and reason without the Holy Spirit] is death... But the mind of the [Holy] Spirit is life and peace...' (Romans 8:6 AMP) It can be tempting to trust your own understanding of things, and take things from there, but God sometimes has different plans. God says, 'My thoughts and My ways are not like yours.' (Isaiah 55:8 CEV) </p>
<p>Let the Holy Spirit bring you in line. He may have other plans.</p>
<p>While it's true that God wants us to engage our brains, He also wants us to 'live by faith and not by sight'. Want everything signed, sealed, delivered? Learn to be comfortable with the unknown and you can bathe in God's pools of peace. Jesus said: 'Don't worry about tomorrow. It will take care of itself.' (Matthew 6:34 CEV)</p>
<p>How can God bless you beyond your imagination if you insist that life is lived within what you can imagine?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Won't You revive us...' Psalm 85:6 NLT<em><br />And there he was, in the middle of this huge wide plain as the sun beat down. He looked to the left and then to the right, but the dry stubbly ground was covered with the ivory hue of what seemed to be bones. Yeah, bones?! </em><em>'</em><em>Speak to the bones.</em><em>'</em><em> He recogni</em><em>s</em><em>ed that voice. It was God. </em><em>'</em><em>Here goes...'</em><em> And as he did, and spoke what God had told him to speak, and followed His instruction, he heard a sound sweeping across the wilderness. A strange kind of rattling, a shaking. Before his very eyes the bones started t</em><em>o</em><em> attach themselves, then muscle and sinew started to form all around, then actual flesh. But then God spoke again, </em><em>'</em><em>Breathe life!</em><em>'</em><em> Then a howling, deafening wind came. And then he saw a huge number, a complete army in fact, rise up before his very eyes!</em>
<p>Ezekiel's story (found in Ezekiel 37) might seem a bit weird, but it shows us today that without the life of God, we're just like those same dry bones. Do we need reviving? It's easy to create the right impression, but are we really just becoming religious while our inner life does whatever it wants? Do we have spiritual diseases that are slowly killing our relationship with God? Or maybe we've just settled for second best? God offers us life: 'I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.' (John 10:10 NRS)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p><i>Big? Big doesn't describe it! Like towers, these guys. Built like the Terminator, every one of them. They've got muscles on their muscles. There is no possible way we could fight them and live to tell the tale. You may as well shoot me here in the desert, because the only promise coming from that Promised Land is one of death and defeat. </i></p>
<p>The Israelites talked themselves into failure before they even attempted to fight. Only Joshua and Caleb had enough belief that God could help them drive out their enemy from their Promised Land. The Israelites scared themselves into losing<b>. </b>Instead of entering the <i>Promised Land</i> then and there,<b> </b>their fear of failure caused a 40 year delay.</p>
<p>Don't let fear become your excuse for failure. Don't let things in your mind grow out of proportion. Sure, your challenge may be big-but don't you have a God who is bigger? Don't dwell on the size of the task; dwell on the size of your God. Philippians 4:8 says it best: '...my friends, fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise: things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely and honourable.' Don't let fear be the reason for your failure.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let me...glean...after him in whose sight I may find favour.' Ruth 2:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Ruth: she has her own book in the Bible, her name is an important one in the family tree of Jesus, and lessons drawn from her life are taught all over the world thousands of years after she died. She must've been born with 'lucky' tattooed on her forehead, right? </p>
<p>Actually, no. She wasn't born into a family who worshipped God. Her husband died while she was still young. And she ends up living in a land far from home. Yet the story of Ruth shows what a hopeful turnaround God can make out of doubtful beginnings. </p>
<p>The opening scene sees Ruth slap-bang in the middle of a famine. No food, no hubby, no family. The only person in her life is Naomi, the mother-in-law (a woman so short on laughs she changes her name to 'Bitter'). It seems the two have little in common: Naomi was Jewish; Ruth wasn't. Naomi was old; Ruth young. Naomi thought her daughter-in-law was better off without her; Ruth wanted to stick with her mother-in-law. </p>
<p>In the end, despite the differences, Ruth got her way and devoted herself to the care of her mother-in-law. God's eyes, which 'range the earth' looking for a heart of faith and commitment (2 Chronicles 16:9), zoomed in on Ruth. From then on, 'blessing' was written all over Ruth. She got a new and good husband, a new home with plenty of land, and a child called Obed, who turned out to be the future granddad of David, Israel's greatest king. What a turnaround! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The teaching of Your Word gives light...' Psalm 119:130 NLT<br /><br /><p>Forget Google or Wikipedia, the answers you need are waiting in that big book gathering dust under your bed. </p>
<p>If you're clueless, that big book says, 'If you need wisdom-if you want to know what God wants you to do-ask Him, and He will gladly tell you. He will not resent your asking.' (James 1:5 NLT) </p>
<p>If you're tempted to take a short-cut, the big book says, 'There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.' (Proverbs 16:25 NLT) </p>
<p>If you're just about to sound off to someone who let you down, the big book says, 'People with good sense restrain their anger; they earn esteem by overlooking wrongs.' (Proverbs 19:11 NLT) </p>
<p>If you're tempted to bend the truth a little, the big book says, 'We don't use tricks, and we don't distort God's Word. As God watches, we clearly reveal the truth to everyone.' (2 Corinthians 4:2 GWT) </p>
<p>If your shopping list is seriously taking over your life, the big book says, 'Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. God has said, &quot;I will never leave you; I will never forget you.&quot;' (Hebrews 13:5 NCV) </p>
<p>If you're ready to tear someone to shreds, the big book says, 'If someone has done you wrong, do not repay him with a wrong... Do everything possible on your part to live in peace with everybody.' (Romans 12:17-18 GNT) Dust off the big book today-read your Bible. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us go on...and become mature...' Hebrews 6:1 TLB <br /><br /><p><i>The insolence of those two brothers! Who do they think they are? Like Jesus wants to sit between that pair while they're bickering for eternity. If anyone's going to sit at His right side in His glory, it's going to be me. I'm the obvious choice. I'm laid back, quite possibly the holiest, not to mention easy on the eye. And did I say how humble I am? </i></p>
<p>Mark 10:35-45 tells the story of an argument between the disciples. James and John have clearly put everyone's back up by asking to be Jesus' wingmen in His Kingdom. Jesus tells them to grow up: '...You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' (Mark 10:42-43 NIV) </p>
<p>Growing up Jesus-style means reducing the swelling of your own head; humility is His way. Instead of clamouring for main stage like James and John, we should be turning the spotlight on others. Instead of ripping that certain someone to pieces, we should be encouraging them to keep going. Instead of being ready with our uncalled-for advice, we should be looking to learn from others. 'Let other people praise you-even strangers; never do it yourself.' (Proverbs 27:2 GNT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us go on...and become mature...' Hebrews 6:1 TLB <br /><br /><p>Ever seen a movie where two people are going at it with the trash talk? Tearing each other down by trying to come up with a bigger insult than the one they just received. Verbal attacks on the other person's looks, intelligence, parentage, or family are all par for the course. Well, unfortunately we too can be too quick with the trash talk at times. We don't want to seem small so we fire a rapid sarcastic comment back to cut the other person down to size. Peter wants us to try a new culture, swapping the trash talk for prayer talk. 'Never return...insult for insult...pray...for their welfare, happiness, and protection...that you may...inherit a blessing [from God]... Keep [your] tongue...from evil.' (1 Peter 3:9-10 AMP) </p>
<p>Imagine Peter's version of trash talk: <i>Your family's so poor I'm bringing you food and clothing round tonight! I'm praying for wisdom for your dad! You may be dirty now but the blood of Jesus can wash you white as snow! </i>Ok. So maybe that kind of talk won't catch on. But here's the challenge, why not look for the best in people, not the worst? The beauty. Not the ugliness. '...win favour and a good name in the sight of God and man.' (Proverbs 3:4 NIV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do any of you want to live a life that is long and good?' Psalm 34:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Being young and in a church can be a challenge. Very often young people are overlooked. More often they are underestimated.</p>
<p>When the church doesn't connect with youth, it's straying from the template set by Jesus. When Jesus wanted to kick off the greatest revolution ever seen in history, what did he do? He included the youth. Maybe the older generation were too set in their ways. Maybe the religious brigade had it all sussed so they weren't open to new teaching. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Jesus bypassed the holy huddle of the day and put His trust in young outsiders. Peter might have been older and married but John, the disciple Jesus loved, probably wasn't even old enough to vote. </p>
<p>You never hear of Jesus taking the youth 'out of the main service' because it might be a little over-their-heads. Far from it, Jesus has them casting out demons, venturing on mission trips, making supper for thousands. A gap year with Jesus would have been pretty intense. Here's what Paul says we should do about Him: '...grow up in every way into Christ, who is the head.' (Ephesians 4:15 NCV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Consider it all joy...when you encounter various trials.' James 1:2 NAS<br /><br /><p><i>James must've flown over the cuckoo's nest once too often! What is he talking about in today's verse? 'Consider it all joy...when you encounter various trials...' Joy?! To be sure, there's nothing like your teacher handing you a bad test result to bring a smile to your face, is there? And it's such a laugh when you're bullied just because you're a Christian, eh? </i></p>
<p>Has James lost the plot or could he be getting at something here? The rest of the verse gives us a clue: '.... knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance...that you may be perfect and complete...' (James 1:2-4 NAS) </p>
<p>Trials, tests or bad times bring us back to basics: prayer. Emergencies-whether they are illnesses, break-ups, disasters or whatever-bring us to our knees. September 11 in 2001 reminded the western world that life is short. The aftermath in America saw people hit churches in record numbers. Sceptical atheists have been known to send up prayers at the deathbeds of loved ones. Bad times remind us all that life is fragile and there must be more to it all than this. </p>
<p>This is especially true for the Christian. Hard times force us to admit we're doomed unless God turns up. James asks us to consider tough times as joy because the pain sobers us up. The hurt draws us to the presence of God. The sting thrusts us into Godly maturity. James is NOT saying that you deserve the pain, nor that you need to sit in it helplessly (especially if it's the sort of thing you should be telling someone about). What James is saying is God is there with you in it and, even though it can be downright terrible, He can use it to change you into something beautiful and perfect. Getting closer to God can only be a joy, right? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p><i>In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war...David remained in Jerusalem.</i></p>
<p><i>One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, 'She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.' Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. </i>(2 Samuel 11:1-4 NIV)<i> </i>King David took what didn't belong to him: Bathsheba was somebody else's wife. Lust began to control his actions and suddenly David had added the murder of a good and loyal man to his sin of adultery. </p>
<p>For a while it was all going to plan: David had a new wife, a baby on the way, and no one else the wiser. Except the thing he did had displeased the Lord. David had to live with the consequences of his royal fall. His cosy picture of domestic life was totally shattered. Bathsheba gave birth to a son who only lived seven days. And the text suggests that, in David's case, it was in judgment for his failing. What we learn from David's failure is that sometimes we are forced to live with the consequences of a fall. When you repent of your mess-up, God always forgives. But you may still have to work through the repercussions. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Never let loyalty and kindness leave you!' Proverbs 3:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you've ever had to deal with disappointment, cope with being rejected, or experienced the pain of a broken promise, you will understand that loyalty and kindness really matter.</p>
<p>The Bible says, 'Never let loyalty and kindness get away from you! Wear them like a necklace.' That means all the time, in all circumstances, in every situation-not just when you feel like it. That might be easy to say, but when your friends have deserted you, your friend's just dumped you or your parents have gone back on their word, it can feel like the end of the world. We don't want to stay loyal and be kind, we want to shout and scream-we want them suffer, to hurt like we're hurting! </p>
<p>Shortly after mentioning the importance of loyalty and kindness, the Bible says, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.' (Proverbs 3:5 NLT) God knows that what's good for us doesn't always come natural to us. It's at these times that we need to trust God, believing His way is better than our way. Frank Clark once said, 'Kindness makes a fellow feel good whether it's being done to him or by him.' </p>
<p>If you're struggling today to do the right thing, the loyal thing or the kind thing, ask God to help you, and be '...certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue His work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.' (Philippians 1:6 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p><i>Then Jesus told them, 'This very night you will all fall away on account of me...' Peter replied, 'Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.' 'Truly I tell you,' Jesus answered, 'this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.' But Peter declared, 'Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.' </i>(Matthew 26:31-35 NIV)</p>
<p>We all let ourselves down from time to time. Simon Peter had heard three years of Jesus preaching on 'turning the other cheek'. But on the night Jesus is arrested he chops off some guy's ear and then, when his earlier bold declaration is tested, he folds and, with swearing and cursing, denies he even knows Jesus! Yep, even the best let themselves down from time to time. </p>
<p>Fortunately Jesus was well aware of Simon Peter's tendency for failure: '...Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.' (Luke 22:31-32 NKJ) </p>
<p>Hear that? Jesus has forgiven him well in advance of the failure. What's more, He's challenging Simon Peter to strengthen other believers when they let themselves down. The challenge, for you too, is to turn your failures into opportunities to sympathise and strengthen other victims of crashing. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God, why have You forsaken Me?' Matthew 27:46 NKJV<br /><br /><p>At Calvary, Jesus asks one of the most heart-wrenching questions ever recorded, 'God, why have You forsaken Me?' These words are also found in Psalm 22:1, where David poured out his heart in despair. Ever felt like that? The Bible says that when Jesus was crucified, God made Jesus 'who knew no sin, to be sin...so...we might become the righteousness of God in Him.' (2 Corinthians 5:21 NAS) In order to break sin's hold on mankind and make salvation possible, Jesus went through a temporary separation from God. At that precise moment He felt 'Godforsaken'. If you've ever felt overwhelmed and abandoned, you know from experience that there's not another living soul who has a satisfactory answer to your 'Why?' With good intentions our loved ones can only go so far. Only God can pour His healing into your broken heart and help you make sense (or at least accept) what's happening. That's why you need to go to Him for your answers.</p>
<p>But here's the flip side of asking tough questions, you might get tough answers. Are you willing to accept His answer and do what He says? The Bible says, 'God has given us...His promise and His oath' (Hebrews 6:18 NLT), so even if you don't get the answer you want, you can trust that He's listening. Check this out: the One who makes 'everything ...work together for...good,' (Romans 8:28 NLT) always sends the answer that's in your best interests. So you can trust Him today...and the next!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Her children stand and bless her...' Proverbs 31:28 NLT<br /><br /><p>Dairy Milk. Freddo. Time Out. Boost. Roses (for the older generation)... What's your favourite Cadbury product? </p>
<p>The word Cadbury puts a smile on our face because it's the name of one of the biggest brands of the sweet brown stuff we know as chocolate. The company was founded almost 200 years ago when the founder John Cadbury opened up a shop in Bull Street, Birmingham back in 1824. </p>
<p>But it wasn't just the public who enjoyed the delights of the Cadbury empire. Their workers did too-because Cadbury looked after their people much better than most employers did in those days. Inspired by their Christian faith, they built houses with gardens, a swimming pool at the factory, and even set up pension plans.</p>
<p>John and his wife then passed on the company to their sons George and Richard. The good times continued to roll as the sons built cricket pitches and playing fields next to the chocolate factory. Sometimes, they'd knock off work early to all have a game of cricket! </p>
<p>Considering the only option of most other workers was probably a grimy coalmine in pitch black for 15 hours a day, this was very radical stuff. The Cadbury family was serious about the Kingdom of God coming to earth. They set in place the principle of treating their neighbour as they'd like to be treated and made sacrifices to make it happen. I'll '<i>Chomp'</i> to that!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...problems and trials...are good for us-they help us learn to endure.' Romans 5:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Who wants to go through a tough time? What a stupid question! Who on earth puts up a hand, shouting, 'Yes please, pick me!'?</p>
<p>Actually anyone who's serious about living their life with God is signing themselves up for tough times along the way. But before you start ripping up your copy of <i>word4U2day</i>, know this: God will use tough times to help you, so you'll be all the better for it. God doesn't take us into deep water to <i>drown</i> us, but to <i>develop</i> us. </p>
<p>Some of the people you can't stand right now are the very ones God will use to help you grow spiritually. Honestly if you want to see some improvements in your character then tough times will help, not hinder. We actually need situations that make us angry if we're ever going to learn to control that temper. We need to be irritated if we're ever going to develop patience. We need to meet people we dislike if we're ever going to find the ability to love.</p>
<p>Today, thank God for those people in your life who bring out the worst in you, who stretch your faith and drive you crazy. God is using them to develop your character. It's thanks to them that you know how much more of God you need. So ask Him today for extra supplies of His love, patience, self control, forgiveness and understanding. Soon you'll discover those people can't bring out the worst in you because you'll be a changed character. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['[God] wrestled with him until...' Genesis 32:24 GNT<br /><br /><p>Have you read the account of the physical fight between Jacob and God in Genesis 32? It was a wrestling match that went on all night; if tickets could have been sold, the stadium would have been packed. Television crews would have broadcast it to the world; it would go down in history as the fight of all time: Jacob versus Almighty God. But there was no one else there. Struggling with life and scared of facing up to his past, Jacob got rid of all distractions. He left himself alone to fight it out with God. And he was determined not to give in until God answered, until God blessed him. </p>
<p>A few lessons for us from the big 'Fight Night': </p>
<p>(1) <i>God turned up</i>: God gives us permission to confront Him with our issues. No problem is too difficult for Him. So be real, be honest. </p>
<p>(2) <i>God wrestled</i>: He'll never leave us struggling alone. </p>
<p>(3) <i>God blessed</i>: Jacob was changed. Never bury your head in the sand. Confronting tough stuff with God always brings out the best outcome.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These trials will show that your faith is genuine...' 1 Peter 1:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>So you want to sparkle like a diamond? Well, before a stone becomes a diamond it's just a lump of carbon put under heaps of pressure. </p>
<p>The Bible says, 'These trials will show that your faith is genuine.' You become so engrossed with 'how you're feeling' or 'what's gone wrong' that you miss what God is up to through it all. God hasn't gone AWOL; He's allowed this trouble to happen so that your faith can shine. Hard as this might be to hear right now, there is nothing like a spot of trouble to bring your 'faith life' into the open. Singing perfect harmonies to the latest worship song doesn't impress God half as much as putting your trust in Him when your life is badly out of tune. </p>
<p>James knew a thing or two about sparkling: '... be very happy when you are tested in different ways. You know that such testing of your faith produces endurance. Endure until your testing is over. Then you will be mature and complete.' (James 1:2-4 GWT) </p>
<p>There's far more to being a Christian than singing when you're winning. There's singing when it hurts. If you want to sparkle, you first have to endure the pressure.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Rise and go; your faith has made you well.' Luke 17:19 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>I could never do that, I'd be too embarrassed. What if they think I'm stupid? Who am I, anyway? </i>Whatever reason you choose for not doing what God asks just doesn't cut it. God didn't ask Moses, a man with a proven stutter, to speak up for His people because He enjoyed watching embarrassment. He'd appointed Moses the job of 'rescuer' before time began. </p>
<p>Likewise, God isn't prompting you to tell your mate about Jesus because He wants you cut down by the 'in' crowd. He knows only you can connect with your friend. If you've heard from God, now is the time to step on it. </p>
<p>There is a story in 2 Kings 5: 1-19 about Naaman, a top general in the Syrian army. He had plenty of muscle, and plenty of respect. But Naaman had leprosy. He eventually put all his hopes in Elisha for a miracle healing. However, when God's prophet didn't wave a magic wand over him, he threw a hissy fit along these lines: <i>'If it was a wash I came for, I could've picked baths better than your Jewish sewers.'</i> He didn't act upon God's Word, so he didn't get healed. </p>
<p>Meantime, his servant did the old 'count slowly to ten and breathe deeply' thing,<b> </b>before suggesting there could be something about bathing in the Jordan. Namaan did see sense, acted upon the Word of God, and wound up with skin as smooth as any you'll see in a cosmetic commercial. Lesson: <i>When God speaks, act!</i> </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Rise and go; your faith has made you well.' Luke 17:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Perhaps you've felt you've had your fair share of being an 'outsider'. But imagine being a leper in Jesus' day. Everywhere you walked you had to ring a bell, as if you were a lost cow, just to let people know you were approaching. Once the bell chimed, people would run for cover in order to get away from you. You weren't allowed into church because people, who really should've known better, believed that God had washed His hands of you. </p>
<p>Can you relate to that kind of treatment? You feel like God has snubbed you. Feel like people avoid you. Feel like you're never going to be back on the up and up because the people surrounding you are as messed up as you are. If so it's time to shout out for Jesus. In Luke 17, that's what the people with leprosy did. They broke the rules. Instead of ringing their usual bells and crying out, 'Unclean,' like they were supposed to, they took a chance on crying out for Jesus. And no, God didn't run for cover, He stopped to answer. </p>
<p>Desperate people pray desperate prayers and God responds to their prayers. James teaches us: 'When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives.' (James 4:3 NIV) So today, get your heart right and pray! Jesus tells us, 'So I tell you to ask, and you will receive.' (Luke 11:9 GWT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Rise and go; your faith has made you well.' Luke 17:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Let's look again at the ten people with leprosy Jesus healed. Their flesh is getting worn away and yet what does Jesus do? Magic up some special kind of medicine? Snap his fingers and, voilà, skin velvety as a new born? Nope. Jesus sends them walking. There is no on-the-spot miracle for these people. He asks them to walk in faith. </p>
<p>Imagine as they head to the temple to show the priests that they've been cured. At first maybe there was a bit of hesitation-<i>'But we're not even cured!'</i> But the further they walked, the better their bodies became. Picture the scene as rotten stubs healed, wounds and sores gave way to layers of smooth skin. Can't you just hear these guys laughing all the way to the temple? </p>
<p>Sometimes before God will do the miraculous, He'll ask you to do the ridiculous. When God tells you something, best step on it. 'And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.' (Luke 17:14 NKJ) Note the words, 'as they went.' The Bible says, 'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord...' (Psalm 37:23 NKJ) Whether it's healing, direction, forgiveness, or whatever you need, these people remind us to keep walking in faith. Maybe God doesn't want to snap His fingers over your problem; maybe He's asking you to carry on walking. Maybe the walk is the way to your wholeness.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Get rid of the slave woman and her son.' Galatians 4:30 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Hurry up!' How many times have you blurted that at someone? 'Hurry up and get out of the bathroom!', 'Hurry up, I'm going to be late!', 'Hurry up, you're taking too long!' We can even stand in a fast-food queue thinking, 'Hurry up, I'm starving!' </p>
<p>Waiting is nobody's strong point. When we want stuff it's always <i>now</i>! What about when you pray-do you find yourself getting impatient when God hasn't got your prayer sorted in five minutes? Do you shout, 'Hurry up, God!'? Or worse, do you take matters into your own hands when your patience runs out?</p>
<p>God says, 'Get rid of the slave woman and her son.' Let's understand what God's saying here. This bit of the Bible reminds us of a time when Abraham tried to hurry up God's plans and as a result birthed the conflict that continues even today between Jews and Muslims. </p>
<p>Hurrying God up is never a good idea; waiting for Him to 'call the shots' saves us from unnecessary upset. It's said that some people dream of great achievements, while others stay awake and experience them. Which will you do? Live out God's great plans in His timing or dream about what that must be like? Jesus said: 'I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.' (John 10:10 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is the wonderful message He has given us to tell others.' 2 Corinthians 5:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Why we don't share our faith with others: (a) we're not sure of it (b) we don't know how (c) we fear rejection. But do you really want to be pulling out one of those excuses when you stand before the throne of God?' </p>
<p>Paul writes, '...my life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned to me by the Lord Jesus-the work of telling others the Good News about God's wonderful kindness and love.' (Acts 20:24 NLT) You don't have to use fancy words; you just have to share the story! What story? Listen: 'So the Word became human and lived here on earth among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness. And we have seen His glory, the glory of the only Son of the Father. ' (John 1:14 NLT) It's amazing-Jesus left Heaven and came to Earth with all its hurt, sorrow and sin. When you tell your friends about Jesus you can let them know that He understands all their frustration and pain. Heaven is an awesome thing to look forward to but it's not the ONLY thing we have to look forward to. Take the pressure off yourself! You don't have to bust a gut to convince or convert anybody; just share with them the answers you've found to the questions they're facing. Bit by bit they'll come to see that their life really does fit into God's big story-a story with a fantastic ending!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['With God nothing will be impossible.' Luke 1:37 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Are you a <i>bear with a sore head</i> when Monday morning rolls around? Do you struggle to get out of bed and grump your way through your Weetbix? Or maybe you have the same problem with Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or, for that matter, the rest of the week? Life can sometimes seem too hard and too much, leaving us feeling too weak and empty to do anything about it.</p>
<p>But when we live our lives with God, He changes all that. In John 10:10 NLT, Jesus said, '...My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.' And 2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV tells us, '...if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!' And, because of this, Philippians 2:13 NLT tells us, we no longer have to live life broken and disjointedly-we can be living it large, full of energy, because, '...God is working in you, giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' </p>
<p>Don't let your background, your preconceived ideas, your present difficulties, your past failures, your self-doubt, the opinions of others or that dreaded Monday morning feeling keep you from becoming all that God wants you to be. The Bible says, 'With God nothing will be impossible.' This isn't just a nice sentiment, it's the absolute truth. So take a hold of that God-energy, and make the choice to have a happier Monday.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Devote yourselves to prayer...' Colossians 4:2 NAS<br /><br /><p>With 150 songs, written by at least seven different authors, the book of Psalms shows us that even thousands of years ago people were writing songs, belting out heart-wrenching ballads and bursting into feel-good lyrics. Through good times and bad, they used music to praise God and express confidence in His goodness, majesty and power. </p>
<p>Due to technology, much has changed since the days of the Psalmists. Distances that took months to travel can be reached in hours. Messages that took weeks to deliver can now be texted in an instant. But one thing remains the same: the speed by which you can reach God in prayer.</p>
<p>Words to God-whether sung, spoken, thought or written down-are prayers. And Psalms lets us know that we can talk to God about anything and everything, good and bad. In the lyrics of the Psalms we discover God wants us to be real, honest and open with Him about what's going on in our hearts and heads. So 'devote yourselves to prayer': talk to Him, sing to Him, write to Him today. Every time you buckle a seatbelt, send a text, dial a number or type in a chat window, remember that with God you always have instant access.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...But who do you say I am?' Matthew 16:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>You're too tall, you're too small; you're too fat, you're too thin; you're too normal, you're too weird; you're too confident, you're too shy. People blurt out their opinions left, right and centre. If we're not careful, we can allow them to damage us-chewing us up, spitting us out and leaving us in an insecure heap on the floor.</p>
<p>People do the same with Jesus-voicing their opinions: He's not real, He's not God, He's not important, He doesn't matter, He's boring, He's mad, He's a conman, He's dead. If we're not careful we can allow them to nudge us into unbelief too, twisting our thoughts and words, hopes and experiences into an unrecognisable shape.</p>
<p>When Jesus was on earth people did the same, using their words to try and trick Him. They talked Him down to try to discourage Him. They tried to make Him look foolish to cause His followers to doubt Him. </p>
<p>Jesus knows the damage that people's negative opinions can have on us if we allow them to grow and fester. This is why He sat down and had a chat with His disciples: to teach them not to allow the words of others to destroy them. He asked them, 'Who do <i>you</i> say I am?' to teach them He was indeed the Son of God! Be confident in God, and know that He is bigger than any doubt and negativity that comes your way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Stay away from complaining and arguing.' Philippians 2:14 TLB<br /><br /><p>The Bible encourages us to 'do everything without complaining and arguing.' </p>
<p>Do you need to give your mouth a closer examination today? If friends were to describe you as a character from an AA Milne book (<i>bear</i> with us... J) would they say you are (a) Easy-going Winnie the Pooh; (b) Thankful Piglet; (c) Bouncy-happy Tigger; or (d) Moaning and groaning Eeyore? </p>
<p>Kent Crockett wrote, 'A friend of mine lives on the coast of Florida a few [kilometres] from Kennedy Space Centre. I told him, &quot;It must be fun watching the space shuttle launches and going to the beach all the time.&quot; &quot;I never go to the beach,&quot; he replied. &quot;I don't even go outside my house to watch the space shuttle launch.&quot; &quot;You're kidding me. Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;I've seen them so many times it's no big deal.&quot; When we see the same blessings every day, we eventually stop noticing them. When we stop noticing, we quit appreciating. When we quit appreciating, we stop thanking. When we stop thanking, we start complaining.' </p>
<p>Are you spending more time complaining instead of appreciating? Is your first instinct to moan, or do you weigh up your words before you speak them? Remember: '...Stay away from complaining and arguing' and develop an attitude of gratitude.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God, the source of hope...will fill you...with...peace.' Romans 15:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Someone once said, 'People may not remember exactly what you did or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel.' God doesn't want us to shame, blame, shoot down or rip each other to shreds. In Romans 12:17 NIV Paul says, 'Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody.' Writer Frederick Buechner once wrote, 'Of the seven deadly sins, anger is possibly the most fun. To lick your wounds, to smack your lips over grievances long past, to roll over your tongue the prospect of bitter confrontations still to come, to savour to the last toothsome morsel both the pain you are given and the pain you are giving back-in many ways it is a feast fit for a king. The chief drawback is that what you are wolfing down is yourself. The skeleton at the feast is you.'</p>
<p>God wants to fill you with peace. So let's do the right thing; as it says in Romans 6:13-14 GWT: 'Never offer any part of your body to sin's power... Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have come back from death and are now alive... Do everything that God approves of. Certainly, sin shouldn't have power over you because you're not controlled by laws, but by God's favour.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Answer me when I call...Give me relief from my distress...' Psalm 4:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's human nature to want rid of a problem immediately. Doesn't matter if it's debt, boredom, headaches or an annoying girlfriend or boyfriend, we just want it to go away-now! And when the problem is a real one and seems too big to fix, that's when we cry out to God: <i>Help God! Take it away! Are you listening? It's not right, not fair, I don't like it, I want it out of my life, sort it out, God-now!</i> </p>
<p>These might seem like anxious, immature responses but in the Bible, David sets us an example. When life got tough he cried out to God: 'Answer me when I call...Give me relief from my distress.' When he was panicking, feeling depressed or messed up, he prayed. Many of his 'help me, God' prayers are recorded in the Psalms. In them we discover that no matter what, God always listens, and will never ever reject us. </p>
<p>Now when life is hunky-dory, sunshine and smiles we rarely need to hear this; but when life hits the fan and you feel as though your prayers are bouncing off the ceiling, these words of assurance can be music to our ears. Know God hears you and will answer. His answers might not be what you expect, but He <i>is</i> there for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['How great is the love the Father has lavished on us...' 1 John 3:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>How would you finish the sentence that begins 'Fathers are...'? Our views about dads are learned mainly from our own dads. What is it you've been learning? </p>
<p>Sometimes dads die when children are still young. Sometimes, for many different reasons, dads choose not to live with their children. Sometimes an absent dad is caused by a decision made by someone else. It means that some of us grow up not knowing what it's like to have a father around. And sometimes the dads who are around make mistakes. All dads get it wrong at times and some dads make big mistakes often. It means some children grow up neglected or abused, feeling unloved or unwanted.</p>
<p>Did you know that you have an unbelievably brilliant, indescribable Dad? God Himself. He says, 'I will be your Father, and you will be My sons and daughters...' (2 Corinthians 6:18 NLT) </p>
<p>He is a Dad like no other. He is so attentive, He knows everything about you-your past, present and future. He doesn't miss a thing. And He loves you, coz He loves you coz He loves you. Don't think He's just like your earthly dad-He's much, much better. Infinitely so. Know your Heavenly Father, and know love.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is a mighty tower where His people can run for safety.' Proverbs 18:10 CEV<br /><br /><p>The Bible tells us in John 1:12 NLT that we can become God's children: 'All who believed Him and accepted Him, He gave the right to become children of God.' Part of this right is that, as His child, God will protect us: 'The Lord is a mighty tower where His people can run for safety.' </p>
<p>Does this mean that as God's children nothing bad will ever happen to us? No. In fact elsewhere the Bible says the opposite: '...everyone who wants to live a godly life...will suffer.' (2 Timothy 3:12 NLT) But even though we may have to suffer pain or distress, loss, injury or harm, God will always protect us-He will keep us safe.</p>
<p>Romans 8:28-35 NLT tell us: 'And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them. For God knew His people in advance, and He chose them to become like His Son...and...He called them to come to Him... If God is for us, who can ever be against us? Since God did not spare even His own Son but gave Him up for us all, won't God, who gave us Christ, also give us everything else?' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We have not stopped praying for you...' Colossians 1:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>'I have the power!' shouts Prince Adam raising his sword into the air and becoming transformed into He-Man! How often do you wish you had power to overcome the obstacles that come your way? James 5:16 GWT says; 'Prayers offered by those who have God's approval are effective.' Would you like your life to be different? Pray! Do you want bullying to be a thing of the past in your school? Then pray! Would you like your community, your city, your country to be a safer, fairer place to live? Then pray! This power is available 24/7. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 GWT says 'Never stop praying.' </p>
<p>The apostle Paul knew the power of prayer. Writing to his friends back at a church he helped to plant, he said: 'We have not stopped praying for you.' He knew that no matter where he was or what he was doing, his friends could be helped by prayer. </p>
<p>Why not tap into this power more by using your everyday life as prayer reminders? Like using the name of your church as your computer password so every time you type it you pray for the people there. Set an image of something you want to pray for on your screensaver, so when you see it you pray. Type 'Stop the Traffik' on your mobile's background-praying for an end to human trafficking each time you text or call. There's loads more ideas you can think of. Be consistent in prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came to Abram...saying, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;' Genesis 15:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Fear can build in our own lives when things change, when our situation becomes uncertain, when things happen around us that are out of our control, when we are trying something new, or going somewhere different. In Genesis 12:1 NIV God asked Abraham to make some scary life changes: 'Leave your country, your relatives, and your father's household and go to the land I will show you.' Whenever God asks us to change, the fear factor can hit us. But He understands this and so just as He reassured Abraham thousands of years ago, He reassures us today: '...Do not be afraid...I am your shield, your very great reward.' (Genesis 15:1 NIV) </p>
<p>Scary as it may be to change, the alternative can lock us in to a dead-end life. Don't settle for less than God's best for you. God is your unfailing, inexhaustible, ever-increasing supply source. Awesome! You don't have to go to anybody else for protection or provision; God has you covered. There's nothing to fear.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came to Abram...saying, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;' Genesis 15:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You'd think after being told something a couple of hundred times we'd get the message. But even though that's how often the Bible gives us the 'do not fear' message things still scare us. Fear can hit us anytime and sometimes more than once a day! </p>
<p>All our fears basically come down to two questions: (1) 'Will God protect me?' (2) 'Is God going to provide everything I need?' When Abraham got scared, God answered these two questions for him: 'Do not be afraid...I am your shield, your very great reward.' In the same way, God answers both of our fear questions with a resounding 'Yes!' He will protect us, and He will provide all our needs. </p>
<p>Now this doesn't mean you can go leaping off high buildings, shouting, 'The Lord will protect me,' expecting God to swoop down and catch you just before impact. It doesn't mean you can shop till you drop, max out a credit card and never look for a job, saying, 'God will provide all I need.' You can't expect God to put money in your account to cover your reckless and selfish lifestyle. </p>
<p>God gives us common sense and expects us to use it. God didn't create us to live life doing whatever whenever however we feel like it, no matter how careless or life-threatening it is! God wants us to live a life of trust, listening to and following Him. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came to Abram...saying, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;' Genesis 15:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Researchers have found that about forty percent of the things we worry about never happen. Thirty percent are in the past and can't be helped. Twelve percent involve the affairs of others that are not even our business. Ten percent relate to sickness, real or imagined. That means only eight percent of the things we worry about are even likely to happen! Mark Twain once said, 'I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.'</p>
<p>A survey recently discovered the fear of spiders (arachnophobia) to be the biggest phobia among young people. Fear of needles (trypanophobia) was second, with fear of clowns (coulrophobia) third and fear of flying (aerophobia) fourth. But most fears are completely irrational: you would have to fly every day for 19,000 years before the probability you'd be killed in a plane crash gets anywhere close to 100%.</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:25-26 NLT, Jesus tells us '...not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing? Look at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your Heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to Him than they are?' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The eyes of all look expectantly to You...' Psalm 145:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Nicknames are commonplace across the world. Sometimes, at a young age, we get given nicknames by friends or family. Do you have any? Perhaps there are some you find so embarrassing you prefer to keep them secret; others you choose to wear proudly as part of your identity. Some nicknames tell us what to expect from an individual; for example, if you were told about three people nicknamed 'motormouth', 'brains' and 'beanpole'-well, you get the picture. Our names are a unique part of us.</p>
<p>Did you know that God is known by many different names? Names in biblical times were of great importance, saying something about a person's character. The different names God has been given tell us a lot about who God is too. They let us in on what to expect from God. </p>
<p>Spend a little time getting to know God better through His names: El Shaddai-Lord God Almighty (Genesis 17:1, Psalm 91:1); El Elyon-The Most High God (Genesis 14:20, Isaiah 14:14); Adonai-Lord, Master (Malachi 1:14); Jehovah Nissi-The Lord My Banner (Exodus 17:15); Jehovah Ra'ah-The Lord My Shepherd (Psalm 23:1); Jehovah Rapha-The Lord That Heals (Exodus 15:26); Jehovah Shammah-The Lord Is There (Ezekiel 48:35); Jehovah Tsidkenu-The Lord Our Righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6); Jehovah Mekoddishkem-The Lord Who Sanctifies You (Exodus 31:13); El Olam-The Everlasting God (Isaiah 40:28); Jehovah Jireh-The Lord Will Provide (Genesis 22:14); Jehovah Shalom-The Lord Is Peace (Judges 6:24).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Without faith it is impossible to please Him...' Hebrews 11:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Some people use this excuse with things of God: 'I can't understand it so I don't believe it'. Do they understand how the touch screen on their smartphone works? Or know the precise fuel/air mixture their car's engine requires? Does their lack of understanding on these things stop them driving their car or using their phone? I didn't think so!</p>
<p>All aspects of our life involve <i>faith</i> and to truly believe in God involves living by faith. It's something you do, a way of life. The Bible says that without faith, it's impossible to please God. And why? 'Because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.' </p>
<p>If you want to know God you have to put your faith in Him. God wants you to trust His Word, His character, and His track record of faithfulness. It is impossible to please Him if you don't.</p>
<p>Here's a bunch of cheesy-but-true acronyms to give you a little more insight to what it means to live by faith: <b>F</b>antastic <b>A</b>dventure <b>I</b>n <b>T</b>rusting <b>H</b>im; <b>F</b>ear <b>A</b>in't <b>I</b>n <b>T</b>his <b>H</b>ouse; <b>F</b>or <b>A</b>ll <b>I</b>s <b>T</b>hrough <b>H</b>im; <b>F</b>or <b>A</b>nswers <b>I</b> <b>T</b>rust <b>H</b>im; <b>F</b>orsaking <b>A</b>ll <b>I</b> <b>T</b>rust <b>H</b>im. </p>
<p>Living by faith not only pleases God but brings excitement into our lives, helps cast out our fears and gives us a guaranteed hope that when we do what we can, God will do what we can't.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray...that...words may be given me...' Ephesians 6:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you find church boring? What do you want church to be like? Do you want programmes that meet your needs and show you how to survive in the tough world of today? Or worship that goes beyond songs and brings you heart-to-heart with God? Or leaders that listen to your ideas and value them? </p>
<p>What is your impression of church... and what are you doing about it? What are you putting back into your church? Do you even pray? If you got a dollar every time you prayed for your church leaders, and had to pay a dollar every time you grumbled behind their backs, how would your wallet look? </p>
<p>Paul was one of the great heroes of the early church-used by God to achieve amazing things (read it all in the book of Acts). But even he said, 'Pray...that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me...that I will fearlessly make known...the Gospel.' (Ephesians 6:19 NIV) It is your job to pray massively that God the Holy Spirit will breathe His power into your church leaders, making their words as powerful as dynamite. If we want church to change, it starts with our prayers.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We have all received...one grace after another...' John 1:16 AMP<br /><br /><p>There's an old story that goes like this: a small boy had been late again and again for dinner. One particular day, after his parents had warned him again to be on time, he arrived later than ever. He found his mum and dad seated at the table, already eating. In his place was nothing but a single slice of bread and a glass of water. He sat in silence, about to cry.</p>
<p>Suddenly his dad got up. The boy then watched as his father reached over, picked up his plate and set it before himself. Then his dad put his own full plate in front of his son, smiling warmly as he made the exchange. Later, as a man, he said, 'All my life I've known what God was like by what my father did that night.' What his dad had done was help his son understand God's grace. </p>
<p>Grace is a gift that costs everything for the giver and nothing for the recipient. It always comes free of charge, no strings attached, and on the house. </p>
<p>Ephesians 2:2 GWT tells us how everyone had turned their back on God: 'You followed the ways of this present world and...refused to obey God.' Yet God doesn't give us our 'just desserts'! He chooses to love us and forgive us. God is gracious-He gives us gifts we don't deserve, what we cannot earn or buy. The question is will you accept it? Will you live as God intended-not trapped in sin, but free by God's grace?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let God transform you into a new person...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you seen any of the <i>Transformers</i> movies or TV series? If you have, I imagine you'll have noticed that <i>Transformers</i>, as the name suggests, transform. No matter where they are, they are ready to transform when needed, at any given moment. God talks about the importance of always being ready to transform in today's verse: always asking, always available, always willing to 'let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.' </p>
<p>That means 24/7. Whether we're alone or in a crowd, at work or school, playing sport or hanging out with friends, at the cinema or just walking the dog, we're called to fix our attention on God.</p>
<p>Transformation is necessary-we're all prone to 'grace abuse'. Flick through any popular magazine and you'll see temptations everywhere that make sin look downright appealing. </p>
<p>But God always wants to bring out the best in you, not allow you to sink in a muddy mess. However He won't take you by force-there's no arm-twisting involved. It's your choice. When we first get to know Jesus, it's just the beginning. When we stay with Jesus we make progress. But as we choose to be transformed by him, that's when we experience success.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let God transform you into a new person...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you're always out to win popularity points, you could find yourself easy prey for peer pressure! If you're a people-pleaser you could be on your way to ruining your reputation! Cultivating conformity could result in a character catastrophe! </p>
<p>Psalm 37:5 CEV says, 'Let the Lord lead you and trust Him to help.' We're meant to be <i>God led</i>, not people led. We're meant to be followers of Jesus not followers of our friends. Now don't panic, thinking God doesn't want you to have friends; He's not asking you to become a loner. But He is saying: 'Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect His will really is.' (Romans 12:2 NLT)</p>
<p>When we are a follower of Jesus, we have God's Spirit living in us, giving the power to transform. 1 John 4:4 NLT says, 'You belong to God, my dear children...the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world.' God doesn't ask about our ability, or our inability, but about our availability. Are you available to let God transform you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let God transform you into a new person...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Are you one of the crowd, or a unique individual? You might well say the second, but if we're being honest, most of us really just want to fit in.</p>
<p>Chuck Swindoll said, 'The truth is, we hate to appear different lest we be ostracised, branded fanatics and rejected. So, we conform. You'll see it in the child eager to please; the adolescent aligning with peer pressure; the adult breaking their back to keep up with the Joneses.'</p>
<p>God wants His people to be willing to be radically transformed: 'Therefore, I urge you...to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' (Romans 12:1-2 NIV)</p>
<p>Here are two facts God wants you to know about being a transformer. First, <i>it's urgent</i>. Paul says, 'I urge you,' but words like <i>beg</i> and <i>plead</i> are used in some translations.</p>
<p>Secondly, <i>you've got the Holy Spirit's help</i>: believers are promised that 'the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world.' (1 John 4:4 NLT) God is on your side, helping you resist the world's pressure to conform to its ways. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let God transform you into a new person...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's a guy in the Bible called Hosea who helps us understand how difficult the struggle between <i>conforming</i> and <i>transforming</i> can be. His wife's actions caused Hosea to became the talk of the town-he was the centre of a scandal; everyone was gossiping about him and his wife. So the 'conform or transform' struggle began; He wanted to shame her, he wanted to forgive her. He wanted to divorce her and have nothing to do with her, he wanted to take her back and be together again. She disgraced and humiliated him but he chose not to conform. Against all the odds, he transformed to love her and keep on loving her. She made him the joke of the community, yet he allowed God to change him. He was able to give his wife a love she didn't deserve. His transformation enabled a nation back then (and millions since) to see a God who loves us unconditionally.</p>
<p>Be a transformer. God can take what you do and lift it off the scale. Just: 'Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to His service and pleasing to Him... Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind. Then you will be able to know the will of God-what is good and is pleasing to Him and is perfect.' (Romans12:1-2 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to move on.' Exodus 14:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Imagine you've been given the biggest, most important job of your life so far. Overwhelmed, you're not convinced you can do it. But remembering Philippians 4:13, 'I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength,' you drum up confidence from the bottom of your boots, and give it a go. </p>
<p>Unbelievably everything goes great-everybody's impressed, you've zoomed in popularity... but then, problems and difficulties start zapping you from all directions. People who thanked you are now criticising, doubting and blaming you at every opportunity. You wish you'd never started out.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Moses! Things started off terrific for him-at least once he got over himself and agreed to follow God's lead and take a few million refugees out of Egypt. But then they find themselves trapped, with Pharaoh's crack chariot division hard on their heels. What seems to be an inescapable dead end is right in front of them. You can imagine what they said as they turned on Moses: 'You promised us freedom and you've brought us to Loserville.' Their complaining stopped Moses in his tracks, but God said, 'Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to move on.' </p>
<p>So Moses kept moving forward and saw God at work in his life. God parted a whole sea, leading millions to safety, and stopped the enemy advancing. Don't stop and listen to cynics, worriers or doubters! Ask God for directions, and keep moving.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He kept...on going...He kept his eyes on the one...' Hebrews 11:27 NLT<br /><br /><p>Two cute rabbits appear in your garden at once, and you decide you want to catch them. If you try and catch both at the same time you'll catch neither. It's only when you focus on one at a time that you'll achieve what you desired. What about the decisions you are making for your life? If you leave all your options open, you won't achieve much.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill once said, 'Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.' We are capable of doing many things with our lives-we could become a doctor or dentist, teacher or lawyer, policeman or paramedic, actor or dancer. But if we focus on all our options at the same time, we will end up achieving none of them. Decide on one, and stick to it!</p>
<p>Hebrews 11 is full of men and women who achieved much in their life, overcoming many obstacles and traumas. Like Moses: 'He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.' Paul in Philippians 3:13-14 NLT tells us, 'I focus on this one thing...Jesus.' </p>
<p>What about you? Where is your faith focus? Is it all over the place? Jesus one minute, keeping your options open the next? Stay focused all the time! 'Let us fix our eyes on Jesus...who for the joy set before Him endured the cross...and sat down at...the throne of God. Consider Him...so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.' (Hebrews 12:2-3)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be restored.' Lamentations 5:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Lamentations is probably the saddest book in the Bible-the story of a people who refuse to change-and who pay the price in suffering. When we refuse to turn away from the things that God hates, there are always consequences. Any bad habit you cannot break or you refuse to break is a habit that has the power to break you. It's not what you go through in life that messes you up; it's what you keep going back to! </p>
<p>Today it's time to give yourself a 'habit health check'. How many times have you said, 'I'm not going to look at it, I'm not going to listen to it, I'm not going to do it again' only to go out and do it over and over again? Is your addiction so out of control you're heading for a damaging eating disorder, critical drink problem, drug overdose, or fatal self-harming? Do you struggle with compulsions that bring moments of pleasure followed by days of regret and disappointment? </p>
<p>Don't feel down and defeated! The book of Lamentations brings hope for us all. In the face of death and destruction, with life falling apart at the seams, Jeremiah turns tragedy into triumph, eventually crying out to God, 'Great is your faithfulness!' (Lamentations 3:23 NIV) He knew with God there is always hope because He can give us the power to change. </p>
<p>Pray: <i>Turn me back to You, O Lord, and I will be restored</i>. Break those bad habits for good! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I insist on paying the full price...' 1 Chronicles 21:24 NIV <br /><br /><p>Everyone loves a bargain! There's a great sense of satisfaction in getting that trendy top half-price or scouring the supermarkets seeking out those BOGOF ('Buy One Get One Free') offers. That's because there's something quite satisfying about getting a genuine bargain. Some people make it a way of life, refusing to buy food that doesn't display a discount sticker or to hand over cash unless it's a knockdown offer. </p>
<p>Now there's nothing wrong with showing a bit of common sense when it comes to shopping. But it's a big fat no-no when it comes to your commitment to God. There's no cheap deal when it comes to faith; no BOGOF offers on church attendance, prayer times or Bible reading; no bargain basement offers on how we should love. </p>
<p>Commitment to God is about sacrifice, giving that costs in terms of our self, time and money. Ephesians 5:1-2 GNT tells us: 'Since you are God's dear children, you must try to be like Him. Your life must be controlled by love, just as Christ loved us and gave His life for us...' </p>
<p>Giving to God what costs you nothing doesn't demonstrate commitment. Like David, when it comes to serving the Lord we need to 'insist on paying the full price!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us lay aside every weight...' Hebrews 12:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Today is the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics. Imagine if every day were like this with a whopping, solid gold medal awaiting you at the podium. The crowds are chanting your name, the commentators have you picked out, the cameras are trained on you. </p>
<p>What do you do? You strip down, you start the race and you don't quit. You keep your eye on the finishing line, on Jesus. He's the trim, toned athlete who started this race and finished it with records, medals and victories. You get into His training regime-the highs, the lows, the cross, the shame. When your faith has a stitch or your hope pulls a hamstring, you watch the repeats of Jesus hurdling His way through insults, high-jumping hostility and setting the pace from the front in times of trouble. You let Jesus quench your thirst and rehydrate your soul. </p>
<p>And when you feel like you can't move another muscle, when you've hit the wall-you remember your training. Every Olympian has hit the pain barrier but run through it. Only the well-trained win gold; only the well-trained find themselves on God's podium. And the tougher the training, the holier the living. That's why we compete, isn't it? To run our best, flat-out into the arms of our living God? So no more ankle-dragging, no more tripping and traipsing. Run like every day is Olympics 2012 day!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Joshua 1:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The Jordan River stretched out before them. Forty years of petty squabbles and backbiting. Forty years of wandering and wandering. Forty years of desert life; camping in the desert, waking early to see if God had sent manna from the skies again. Forty years. And it was all about to end. </p>
<p>A new life beckoned on the other side of the river. It held the promise of milk and honey and meat and homes and land fit for growing fruit. Yes, it was the promised land. One snag: it was enemy-occupied territory. Who were they to think they could go into battle and drive the current occupants out? And who was this Joshua bloke to think he could lead the battalions? He wasn't a war leader or a guerrilla commander; he was a desert nomad. </p>
<p>Maybe, they should just turn back and find a smaller piece of land. A land where nobody had to be evicted.<i> </i>Maybe. But hadn't God promised the best? A land perfect for growing a mighty nation. If they settled for less, what would that say about the Jews? What would that say about God? Is this a God who promised the best but delivered far less? As fear fluttered like birds in Joshua's insides, God spoke to him. 'Be strong and of good courage.' His spirit was immediately strengthened. God had promised to turn a crowd of past slaves into a mighty, godly nation. Joshua had to act on it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Joshua 1:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>All the Jews were watching Joshua. He needed to be strong, he needed to show courage. He needed to be a role model of strength and belief. It wasn't just about him, it was about those God planned to bless through him. God has told him to 'be strong and of good courage.' So his attitude mattered. His ability to demonstrate faith in the face of impossible odds needed to be seen by the Jews. His actions had to inspire courage in others. </p>
<p>What about you? The battles that you face in life are not just about you, you know. They're also about the people God plans to bless through you. Your friends, your family, your community-only God knows the plans He has for you and only He knows who He intends to influence through you. It's suggested that the average person influences 10 000 people in their lifetime. And, with God on your side, you're far more than 'average'.</p>
<p>So, in what tough areas could you inspire others to be strong? What circumstances could you show others that having faith really makes a difference? Like Joshua, take the lead. You never know who could be watching.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Joshua 1:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>So Joshua heard the words, 'I will give you every place where you set your foot... No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you or forsake you. Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their fathers to give them.' (Joshua 1:3-6 NIV) With these words God gave him the strength and reassurance he needed to lead the fight for the Promised Land. </p>
<p>But all this happened a long time ago, didn't it? Switch on the news now and it seems every other week soldiers are fighting for that little strip of land, all of them claiming they've got a God-given right to it. Doesn't fighting just make orphans and widows? </p>
<p>Joshua's fight was a just fight. His people had been slaves, and now God wanted to restore their heritage. It was a fight worth pursuing. In 1960s America there was another just fight. Dr Martin Luther King also believed in fighting for a promised land. A land where children were judged by their character, rather than the colour of their skin. He called for people to fight by using peace as a weapon. When struck, he would not strike back. An eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind, he believed. God honoured his courage. And, if He has called you to lead a just fight, He will honour yours too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Good Shepherd...lays down His life for the sheep.' John 10:11 AMP<br /><br /><p>Do you find yourself singing 'baa baa black sheep'? Do people count you and your little woolly friends when they can't get to sleep? Ever considered 'cardigan' as a career prospect?</p>
<p>Ok, so obviously Jesus never literally meant that we are sheep; just that our behaviour can be similar to sheep. But how? Well, firstly, we all have a tendency to ramble off on our own: 'We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way.' (Isaiah 53:6 NIV) </p>
<p>Secondly, sheep aren't the smartest of animals. They can't see that far around or ahead. You may think you've got away with that sly dig or whispered put-down, but for how long? God sees everything! 'If I go up to the Heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in the depths, You are there.' (Psalm 139:8 NIV) You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't ever fool God. </p>
<p>God wants us to be honest with Him, with others and with ourselves. That means the good, the bad and the ugly. In James 5:16, we're told to own up when we get it wrong. '<i>Why should I?'</i> you might retort. '...that you may be healed...' (ESV) When you give God all that you are (and aren't), He'll bless you and use you, above and beyond your sometimes sheep-like limitations!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Arise...go...to the land which I am giving to (you)...' Joshua 1:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Is God calling you into something or somewhere new? Whether it's moving to a new job, a new school, a new home or a whole new way of living, any kind of change can freak us out. A change of scenery on the stage of our lives can lead to fear creeping in, looming over us like some kind of shadowy giant. Being obedient to God's call is important so let's learn from Joshua.</p>
<p>God knew Joshua would get scared when he understood what He was telling him to do: 'You and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them.' (Joshua 1:2 NIV) So God said three times to Joshua he would need to be strong and courageous. On the third time He said, 'Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:9 NIV) Remember that God goes with you too. Do you have some giants of fear? With God you can do more than just disable them-you can knock them dead!</p>
<p>At the beginning of Joshua (1:1-9), God gives some sound advice on how to go about moving into a new home and situation. Grab your Bible and check out His advice for yourself. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, &quot;See how He loved him!&quot;' John 11:35-36 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus wasn't interested in superficial smiles here on earth. He didn't shrink away from real emotions. Jesus allowed Himself to be real with people. When Lazarus died He wept with Lazarus' sisters, Martha and Mary. </p>
<p>What would you think about letting your guard down like that? Do you worry about showing people how you really feel? Do you let taunts like 'What are you crying for, boy?' or 'You're such a drama queen!' silence your legitimate emotions? The Bible says, 'For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under Heaven...A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance.' (Ecclesiastes 3:1-4 NLT) </p>
<p>If we put up a safe robotlike shell, we run the risk of coming across as thickskinned or fake. If we make out we're 'Just fine, thank you,' we could miss out on being comforted or bringing comfort to someone else.</p>
<p>Have you got a prayer buddy? If you haven't, ask someone you can trust, someone you feel you can let your guard down with. Do you know someone who needs some comfort and prayers? Why not offer your services!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, by this time he stinketh.' John 11:39 KJV<br /><br /><p>What do you keep in the dark? It's human nature to keep some things in our lives hidden, worrying that if we let them out in the open and into the light, they would let off a right old stink and pollute the fragranced atmosphere. Pride stands in the way because we fear people will look at us in a different way. So we stay in the stink. </p>
<p>Mary and Martha wanted to leave the stink of their dead brother in the tomb. Can you imagine the state Lazarus was in after four days in the grave? So when Jesus told them to get the stone rolled away, it's quite understandable that they didn't see the point. What was Jesus up to? </p>
<p>But Jesus was right when He said, 'If you [will] believe you [will] see the glory of God.' (John 11:40 NKJ) He not only went on to bring Lazarus out of the tomb, He brought him back to life! Sometimes in life there are things that just stink and we'd rather keep buried. We don't want to share our mess with other people or work through it with God. </p>
<p>People may give up on you but Jesus won't. Have you ever changed a baby's nappy? If anything else smelled that bad you would throw it in the trash, right? But not your child; you love them and you know that with a little help they're capable of outgrowing it and becoming something good. Like Mary and Martha, you may think it's too late for a miracle, but it's not. Your finances may stink, your relationship may stink, your prospects for the future may stink but, if you will believe, you will 'see the glory of God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who observes the wind will not sow...' Ecclesiastes 11:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Some people suck up their food quicker than a vacuum cleaner. Others are 'savour the flavour' types who take their sweet time chewing every mouthful. Multitaskers talk while eating and let you in on the process of how exactly their food is breaking down-a delight for all at the table! And then there's the 'nibble, pick or play' sort who spend more time rearranging the food on their plate than actually eating it. They can spend ages before even moving the fork to their mouth!</p>
<p>We're all different in how we approach the little things in life. But we can be sure about this tasty fact-God's ways are different from ALL our ways. It's important to remember that if we're too concerned with making sure everything's right before we talk to people about Jesus, we'll never get started.</p>
<p>The Bible says, 'Farmers who wait for perfect weather never plant. If they watch every cloud, they never harvest.' (Ecclesiastes 11:4 NLT) If you're waiting for everything to be perfect with you or those you care about before you open your mouth and start telling people about Jesus, you'll never get round to it-or see the rewards.</p>
<p>So<i>, </i>challenge yourself. Next time you're with someone you haven't told about Jesus, pray for God to give you a way into the conversation to start sowing! See what God does!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith is being sure of what we hope for...' Hebrews 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's tempting to think that successful people are those who get it right first time, every time. But many of them simply see failure as a steppingstone to success. Polio was once one of the most feared diseases in the world. Jonas Salk, the developer of the vaccine which finally eliminated this deadly threat, failed many times before he succeeded. Every time his team was discouraged by something that didn't work, he'd say, 'Great, we've made a great discovery!' By learning what didn't work, they came closer to what did.</p>
<p>Giving up on ourselves can stem from listening to negative words spoken against us. Hopes and dreams can shatter to pieces on the sharp rocks of harsh words. </p>
<p>There's Someone, though, who has monumental faith in you and wants to speak better words over you. He has anchored those hopes and dreams deep in your soul. He's not in the business of making hopeless cases; He creates masterpieces. You're valuable to Him and are made for great things. To believe and hope in this, we have to have faith in Him and who He says He is. Jesus said, '...I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.' (John 10:10 NIV)</p>
<p>Ask your Dad in Heaven about your hopes and dreams. Write down or draw anything He gives or reveals to you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He kept his eyes on the One who is invisible.' Hebrews 11:27 NLT<br /><br /><p>It starts out like this: <i>'</i><i>We were texting loads and </i><i>then, on last night</i><i>'</i><i>s text, there were three kisses at the end! Three! Before it was two, max! Honestly, serious butterflies when I got that text. So nice having someone to make you feel special...</i><i>he</i><i>'</i><i>s my everything.</i><i>'</i> </p>
<p>But then, this happens: <i>'</i><i>You will not b</i><i>elieve this, right. I texted him three kisses, right, as usual. We always send three kisses</i><i>-</i><i>minimum. He texts back one, </i>one<i>! I felt so special before and now I just feel like old bubblegum he wants to scrape off his shoe!</i><i>'</i></p>
<p>It doesn't matter how perfect you think someone is, they will eventually disappoint, upset or frustrate you. No one gets it right all the time. That's why getting your confidence and self-worth from God, and not from someone else, is so important. Your relationship with Him, the unseen, should come before anyone or anything. Loved ones can come and go, but look at God's love in comparison: '...Neither death nor life...neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 8:38-39 NIV)</p>
<p>Take time out to think of some things that stress or worry you, then, make a decision to 'Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.' (1 Peter 5:7) He promises He will '...quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing.' (Zephaniah 3:17)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Faith...if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.' James 2:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>We live in a bit of a 'microwave culture' nowadays, don't we? It's all about how quickly we can have something. We want to hear that sweet 'ping' after only a couple of minutes' wait and (let's face it) very little effort from ourselves. </p>
<p>The reality is, however, microwave food doesn't taste that great, especially when compared to one of mum's special dishes. All the time and effort taken over a carefully-prepared home-cooked dinner becomes obvious in its taste. All that time and effort counts. It's exactly the same for most things we want in life: we have to be prepared to put in time and effort. </p>
<p>'For we are labourers together with God...' (1 Corinthians 3:9 KJV) Having the gift of faith in God and what He can do in our lives is an amazing, life-transforming thing. But God wants us to play our part too. You can't ask for God to help you pass all your exams without putting any work into the revision-that's not using your God-given abilities. And if we're to put time and effort in with God like Jesus, we've got to make sure that love is at the centre. Because the Bible says that if we're not love-focused in what we do, it don't mean diddly! </p>
<p>So put some time and effort into study time with God! Look up how to be a really good 'labourer' with Him and for Him by checking out 1 Corinthians 3:1-23 and 2 Corinthians 6:1-18. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He gives more grace...' James 4:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Attitudes can be pretty ugly things. Like, when you say hello to someone and they look you up and down with that 'Hello Declined' expression on their face. Bah. However ugly their reaction may look, there's part of you just wants to fire back the same attitude at them. Or better yet, to slap that selfrighteous pout off their face! <i>Who do they think they are?</i></p>
<p>It's moments like these when you need to ask yourself a different question: <i>who  am I?</i> We aren't called to imitate ugliness. We're called to imitate Christ and His beautiful attitude. 'For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered for you. He is your example, and you must follow in His steps.' (1 Peter 2:21 NLT) Jesus said, 'If any of you wants to be My follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow Me.' (Matthew 16:24 NLT) </p>
<p>Our perspective on things will change completely when we look at it in the light of the purpose of Christ. There are people out there that we can see as Extra Grace Cases. We need to turn to God to get that extra grace and make the decision to love like Jesus.</p>
<p>You can't love like Christ without His help. Pray Paul's prayer out loud for yourself, found in Ephesians 3:14-21. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus went...to a place called Gethsemane...' Matthew 26:36 NIV<br /><br /><p>Are you praying hard for something to change and God just isn't answering the way you want? You should know that Jesus has been right there with you-in Gethsemane. 'Jesus went...to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and He said, &quot;Sit here while I go over there to pray.&quot;...He went on a little farther and bowed with His face to the ground, praying, &quot;My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from Me. Yet I want Your will to be done, not Mine.&quot;' (Matthew 26:36-39 NLT)</p>
<p>Whatever trials you go through, you need to know that Jesus has been there, done that and bought the ripped and bloodstained Tshirt. He's been there; beyond any human pain and struggle we've been through or can even think of. </p>
<p>Jesus knew that soon He would be arrested and crucified. He was praying for another way because He could see the suffering ahead. But Jesus knew that however hard it was at that moment, God's way was the way that would work all things for good.</p>
<p>To want God's will means having faith in who He is. Check out Joyce Meyer's <i>Trusting God When You Don</i><i>'</i><i>t Understand</i>. It's a powerful message of faith, trust and God's transformation. (bit.ly/Hyogm4)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, open his eyes so he may see...' 2 Kings 6:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible records: 'When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. &quot;Oh, my lord, what shall we do?&quot; the servant asked. &quot;Don't be afraid,&quot; the prophet answered. &quot;Those who are with us are more than those are who are with them.&quot; And Elisha prayed, &quot;O Lord, open his eyes so he may see.&quot; Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.' (2 Kings 15-17 NIV) By God's power, the servant saw angels. And God can help you to see His hand at work in what you're going through today. He never promises to remove us from our struggles, but He promises to change the way we look at them. After listing many of his problems, Paul writes: 'In all these things we have complete victory through Him...' (Romans 8:37 GNT) We'd prefer Paul said 'apart from all these things,' but he actually says, 'In all these things.' The solution is not to avoid trouble, but to change the way we see it. God asks, 'Who gives a person sight?' Then answers, 'It is I, the Lord.' (Exodus 4:11 GWT) God let Elisha's servant see an army of angels, Jacob see a ladder that went into Heaven, and Saul of Tarsus (Paul) see Jesus on the road to Damascus. The blind man said to Jesus, '...I want to see,' (Mark 10:51 NIV) and he walked away with clear vision. Today ask God to let you see His hand in every circumstance.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor!...' Psalm 41:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>We may lack the latest, the biggest, the finest and the fastest, but we seldom lack the necessary, right? God doesn't 'guilt-trip' us, but He does want us to consider [remember, be mindful of] the poor. 'But if there are any poor people in your towns...do not be hard-hearted or tightfisted toward them. Instead, be generous and lend them whatever they need. Do not be mean-spirited... If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the Lord, you will be considered guilty of sin. Give freely without begrudging it, and the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.' (Deuteronomy 15:7-9 NLT)</p>
<p>You might think, <i>'</i><i>Oh, you know I</i><i>'</i><i>d love to help out but, well, they don</i><i>'</i><i>t call me &quot;</i><i>moneybags&quot;</i><i> you know.</i><i>'</i> The Bible pushes us to look deeper: 'If you have two shirts, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry.' (Luke 3:11 NLT) There are always things we can do. </p>
<p>James 2:14-26 tells us faith and deeds go together. We've been called to feed, shelter and clothe the needy (Isaiah 58:5-12). God is compassionate and generous to the poor, and He asks us to follow His example.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who gives to the poor will lack nothing...' Proverbs 28:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, for He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor...' (Luke 4:18 NLT) He also said that '...anyone who believes in Me will do the same works I have done...' (John 14:12 NLT) </p>
<p>Let's have a look see at how the New Testament church lived that out: 'All the believers...shared everything they had. They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need...' As a result, they experienced 'great joy'. (Acts 2:44-46 NLT) </p>
<p>Not sure you believe all that warm fuzzy joy bit? I'm sure some of them would rather have been in Toys&quot;R&quot;Us than this upsidedown, shareycarey Jesus&quot;R&quot;Us! Some people would not have been pleased with this arrangement. All that sharing meant they lost out in the long term, right? Wrong. That's not how God's Kingdom works at all.</p>
<p>Here's a look into the workings of God's Kingdom: 'One man gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty. A generous11 man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.' (Proverbs 11:24-25 NIV) Freely give to others and the Lord will give back to you. Don't let any selfishness or fear tighten your purse or harden your heart, because '...those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing.' (Psalm 34:10 NLT)</p>
<p>Next time God nudges you to show compassion and give, do it. Then when you have a need, you'll have Psalm 34 bursting from your lips like David. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They gave themselves...to the Lord and then to us...' 2 Corinthians 8:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's hard to know how to best help people in need. Like homeless people, for example: <i>'</i><i>Where</i><i>'</i><i>s my money going, eh? Are they even homeless? They could be professional con artists for all I know. I want my money to go towards a bed for the night, not wasted on smokes or drink.</i><i>'</i><i> </i>All these thoughts and fears can swim around in our brains, leaving us swept up with doubt on whether our giving actually does any good. Sometimes that means when we're walking down the street and we spot a homeless person out of the corner of our eye, we check the phone we know hasn't buzzed; we look anywhere but at them; we shut ourselves off because it feels easier that way. </p>
<p>But if you have a read of 2 Corinthians, you'll see that the Macedonian church went about giving in this way: 'They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.' It was a natural response to meeting Jesus. Giving simply flowed out as part of the purposes of God working in their lives! First give yourself to God more and more and then let His mind at work in you guide you. Because it's possible to give without loving, but you can't love without giving to those God loves.</p>
<p>Pray and let God's wisdom guide you next time you are asked on the street. You might just end up talking to them. Who knows, they might let you pray for them? Remember giving means more than simply dollars and cents.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The time has come, He said...' Mark 1:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes it can feel pretty daunting telling people about Jesus, even though we know the Gospel is fantastically good news. We zip up our mouths because we feel the responsibility squeezing the life out of us like a straightjacket. We can feel too small for the job: 'What if I say the wrong thing?' 'What if I put them off?' 'What if talking about God without three years of Bible College theological know-how will actually end up putting them off Jesus?' </p>
<p>That's a whole heap of excuses! The Gospel should be shared as simply as possible. Giving someone a load of Christianese using words like 'bloodwashed' and 'sanctification' is probably just gonna go over their heads anyway! Evangelism isn't a project or a task, it's just a natural extension of your relationship with God. What do you do when something great has happened in your life? You tell someone! </p>
<p>Most importantly, take off the stifling straight-jacket of responsibility and give it back to God! It's the Holy Spirit who convicts a person's heart of their need for God. He's the Saviour, not us. Jesus' delivery style went like this: 'At last the time has come!... The Kingdom of God is near! Turn from your sins and believe this Good News!'(Mark 1:15 NLT) God wants to use <i>your</i> style! Just be yourself! </p>
<p>Do you have any friends or family who don't know why you follow God? Have a think about how you might let them know, without making it a task or a project! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This man welcomes sinners...' Luke 15:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus upset a lot of people. Mainly the self-righteous mob of Pharisees, who didn't take too kindly at the thought of prostitutes or tax collectors entering the Kingdom of Heaven before them. Read about it for yourself in Matthew 21.</p>
<p>Why did He love them? He said, 'Healthy people don't need a doctor-sick people do. I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.' (Mark 2:17 NLT) The high priests and leaders who Jesus was talking to refused to believe that He was the Son of God and rejected Him and what He said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sinners believed, knew they needed Him and spent every minute with Him soaking up His every word. Jesus made sinners and outcasts of society welcome at the dinner table with Him. They loved being around Him and Jesus showed them that life would taste better being with Him and living like Him. He accepted invitations into their homes and got involved in their lives. Jesus says that His followers are 'the salt of the earth'. Just like Him, He wants us to be like salt shakers around the table, bringing the first flavour of a new life in Christ into everyone's lives.</p>
<p>If you haven't got many non-Christian friends in your life why not see what community events are going on in your church, or local area, where you could get involved.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who are you to judge someone else's servant?' Romans 14:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>When we judge other people, we can jump to all kinds of conclusions that can not only be just plain wrong, but potentially really harmful. Judging and gossiping often go hand in hand, making a juicy but toxic cocktail with all sorts of bad consequences. Sometimes we find ourselves mentally accusing an innocent person of all sorts of wrongdoing. We can even transfer our own motives on to other people. </p>
<p>The Bible says, '...why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ? And why do you think you are better than they are? We will all stand before God to be judged, because it is written in the Scriptures: &quot;'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'Everyone will bow before Me; everyone will say that I am God.'&quot; So each of us will have to answer to God.' (Romans 14:10-12 NCV)</p>
<p>We need to make it a habit of exchanging words of <i>judgment</i> for words of <i>encouragement</i> and 'pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.' (Romans 14:19 ESV)</p>

He was looking back at how the Lord had helped him in the past through many trials and David had plenty of those! As the saying goes: 'You can't choose your family.' There was enough drama and devastation in the lives of David and his kids to satisfy any daytime TV addict! </p>
<p>Just think of it: 'Coming up on our next talk show, we'll meet the father with a track record for tragedy. A son born dead, a son who raped his own sister, a son who killed his rapist brother, a son killed in battle against him and another son who kills his brother. What gets him out of bed? His story...<i>next!</i>' </p>
<p>That's some dose of devastation for any man to take. It's clear to see through this Psalm that what got David out of bed in the morning was the Lord. 'Lord, I put my hope in You; I have trusted in You since I was young... I will always praise You. My life has been an example to many, because You have been my strong defender. All day long I praise You and proclaim Your glory.' (Psalm 71:58 GNT) </p>
<p>Just like David, God takes all our family issues, worries and faults in His stride. Nothing puts Him off us and nothing's too big for Him: 'His love endures forever.' (Psalm 136:1 NIV)</p>
<p>So, what now? Dig into the Psalms and find one that fits how you're feeling. Personalise it in prayer and worship to God! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I am old...You shall increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.' Psalm 71:18, 21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You can go to all sorts of things for comfort to help you feel better, like attacking that familysized chocolate bar in the fridge. Or seeking attention from other people so you feel wanted and loved for a while. Or  indulging in retail therapy.</p>
<p>These things, as good as they may feel at the time, can have real nasty consequences. Quick fixes don't get rid of the problem. It's like trying to jazz up a pair of shoes by customising them with stickers. Even if they make you into twinkletoes for a while, it's not long before they start peeling off and you're just back to the same shoes, only with annoying gluey bits you've got to pick off. The stickers really weren't worth it. </p>
<p>By giving into emotional quick fixes we can be left picking off more problems than we started with. Not gluey bits, but emotional scars and scabs. Yet God can comfort us from 'every side' of where it hurts. </p>
<p>We can pray for God's help to resist the quick fixes. When we have a need to feel better we should go to the Source of all comfort who never gives us nasty withdrawals, only His loving peace and security.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Even to your old age...will I carry you...' Isaiah 46:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Isaiah was a prophet who spoke with zealous force, with both wit and the wisdom of years of experiencing the dirt of humanity firsthand. In Isaiah 46 he speaks on behalf of God, describing the stark difference between Babylon's idols and the true, real God. 'To whom will you compare Me and make Me equal? To whom will you compare Me so that we can be alike? People pour gold out of their bags and weigh silver on scales. They hire a goldsmith. He makes it into a god. They bow down and worship it. They lift it on their shoulders and carry it. They set the idol in its place, and it stands there. It doesn't move from its place. If they cry to it for help, it can't answer. It can't rescue them from their distress.' (Isaiah 46:5-7 GWT)</p>
<p>God is alive, not dead like a plank of wood. He is the Incomparable, and our attempts to fully understand Him will always fall short. More than that, He is real, He is powerful, and like no idol or made-up god, He offers to carry us throughout life. 'Even when you are old, I will be the same. Even when your hair has turned grey, I will take care of you. I made you and will take care of you. I will carry you and save you.' (Isaiah 46:4 NCV)</p>
<p>We need to get rid of any idols in our own lives. Ask yourself what they are (a good gauge is where most of your time is spent) and bring them to God. Ask Him to remove any you can't see.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Draw your strength from Him...' Ephesians 6:10 AMP<br /><br /><p>Emotions can be so annoying, can't they? Sometimes you can feel things so deeply you simply don't know how to cope. You cry helplessly, 'I don't want to feel this way!' But you still do. </p>
<p>Like: you've broken up with someone and you find out for the first time that they're now 'in a relationship'. So you plaster on a smiley face and tell people, 'I'm not bothered!' But inside, you're full of resentment and residual hurt. </p>
<p>It can be hard to know how to deal with how you're feeling. So offload onto Jesus, the 'Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.' (Isaiah 9:6 NIV) God can give you words that bring light in these dark times. Turning to God isn't about looking for an on/off switch to turn off the pain. God gives us the strength needed to push on through it, to get closer to the best He has for you. 'The Lord your God is with you, He is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, He will quiet you with His love...' (Zephaniah 3:17 NIV)</p>
<p>So, talk to God put your confidence in Him and look to Him for all your answers.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It would not be right for us...' Acts 6:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>We're all highly talented, unique God-created bundles with God-given gifts and abilities. It takes a lot of different skills and personality types to build God's Kingdom. Have a look at the New Testament church in Acts. The church was spreading fast and the apostles were having a tough time dealing with crowd control issues. The apostles had to listen to a lot of disgruntled talk and tutting tongues because the Grecian Jews had a major beef with the Hebraic Jews for, well, eating all the beef. </p>
<p>'...The Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.' (Acts 6:1 NIV) The apostles realised that trying to minimise the issue by ignoring it wasn't the best way forward. After all, they wanted the church to grow, not split. But they didn't want to spend all their time fixing it: '...It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the Word of God in order to wait on tables.' </p>
<p>So what did they do? They gave the responsibility over to seven others who had gifts fit for the task. Then they prayed for them. This way, 'the Word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.' (Acts 6:7 NIV) Crowd control in God's Kingdom means each member using their gifts fit for the tasks given to them!</p>
<p>God has given you specific gifts that He wants you to use to advance His Kingdom. What are they? Ask your pastor to tell you what they think.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed...' Daniel 6:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>You're at your home computer and you think, 'Yeah, I've got time for just one more update on Facebook.' You then hotfoot it to catch the bus, but you just miss it. Eventually you meet up with your friend who's been waiting an hour. Through gritted teeth he says, 'Don't worry about it,' but you spend the next half hour noticing he's only just keeping his cool with you. Punctuality problem?</p>
<p>By their nature, bad habits are lowmaintenance and easily picked up. Whether it's too much Facebook eating your time, or always being late for meetings, bad habits can really get in the way of what we want to achieve. Jesus had some subversively God-centred habits. Here are just a few: <i>(1) Giving God the space and time to speak:</i> 'Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where He prayed.' (Mark 1:35 NIV) <i>(2) Consistent prayer. </i>The disciples might not have always been quick on the uptake but they did notice the connection of Jesus' prayer life with His authority. They wanted to learn from the best: '...Lord, teach us to pray...' (Luke 11:1 NIV) <i>(3)</i> <i>Putting nothing else before God.</i> Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need. </p>
<p>Jesus' habits can transform not just your relationship with God but also every area of your life and peace of mind! If you pay close attention to Jesus' life in the Gospels you'll discover His good habits. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>Are you a bit like Asaph sometimes? Busy walking by sight rather than by faith? Drinking from a bottomless cup of disappointment? Jealous of people who spend their lives doing and worshipping the wrong things? Then, to top it all off they seem to be enjoying life far more than you. How's that for a cherry? Asaph walked so often with his eyes of faith shut, that in Psalm 73 he wrote, '...my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold. For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.' (Psalm 73:2-3 NIV) </p>
<p>Asaph nearly shrugged off God because he was jealous of what he could see happening for those who didn't follow God. But as the Psalm progresses, Asaph grows in faith: 'You guide me with Your counsel, and afterward You will take me into glory. Whom have I in Heaven but You? And earth has nothing I desire besides You.' (Psalm 73:24-25 NIV) He realises any earthly gain is nothing to the guaranteed eternity with God. </p>
<p>There really is no accolade, thrill or relationship better than having God in your life. Why envy others who don't have God? '... those who are far from You will be lost from You forever.' (Psalm 73: 27 NIV)</p>
<p>When things seem too difficult for you or you doubt God, remember Asaph and feast on God's trustworthy Word!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If anyone suffers...' 1 Peter 4:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Check out this passage in the Bible: 'Let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter. For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God...' (1 Peter 4:15-17 NKJ) </p>
<p>If you're enacting God's truth in your thoughts, words and deeds and getting attacked for it, it can be really tough. Whether you're encountering cruel words from others, or you feel like Satan's shredding your selfesteem, the Bible's response 'be glad for it' can seem like a bit rough. Looking deeper though, this is truly a compliment-because you're seen as a threat! Satan hates anything to do with the Kingdom of God so, if you're building it in some way, then he's gonna have a go. After all, you're an enemy! </p>
<p>But fear not: '...the glorious Spirit of God rests upon you.' (1 Peter 4:14 NLT) You're on the right team, so be glad! God is your shelter and your shield. You can rest under Him and He will protect you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has appointed another [future] for me...' Genesis 4:25 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If God has closed the door on something we really want, it's because He has a much better alternative in mind. It might feel like you wanted an adventure playground complete with monkey ropes and sandpit but you got a frisbee from the Two Dollar Shop in its place. But it doesn't work that way at all.</p>
<p>God doesn't want less for us. He wants more. But that does mean trusting that He knows the best way to get there. The process can be painful, so it takes faith. For that we need peace: the peace of knowing that our future is in God's hands: 'And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.' (Romans 8:28 NIV) </p>
<p>God's hands are reliable hands; they never pick up the wrong things for us to do. It's when we don't trust Him and so try to do things our own way that it all starts going shaky! 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.' (Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV)</p>
<p>Why not try writing down any worries you have? Then pray through the list and rip it up as a sign you've given it to God and it's not yours to worry about anymore.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord disciplines those He loves...' Hebrews 12:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Discipline is a harsh word. It probably makes you think of some form of punishment aimed at getting you to behave. So having the words <i>discipline</i> and <i>love</i> in the same sentence in the Scripture above seems like it's a contradiction, right?<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Wrong!</i><i> </i>Ever heard of the phrase 'tough love'? Sometimes God has to give us a spot of it for our own good. One of the hardest things for any parent is to watch their kids make mistakes and go through the painful consequences. </p>
<p>Obviously God would rather keep us from the pain. And that's why the Bible is so valuable: it's God's Word and includes His precautions for us. He explains that when we face choices,  following God is always the right decision. </p>
<p>Don't resent God's discipline, and don't resist it. Recognise that it's for your good. And one more thought: don't allow some well-meaning person to 'rescue' you from God's dealings. God's goal for us in discipline is 'that we might share in His holiness.' No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening! But afterward there will be 'a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.' (Hebrews 12:11 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It was by faith that Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed...' Hebrews 11:31 NLT<br /><br /><p>Living in the wall of the city of Jericho thousands of years ago was Rahab, a prostitute. Fast approaching was Joshua, leading all of God's people. Under God's instructions, they were planning to demolish the entire city.</p>
<p>Was it staring death in the face that caused Rahab to rethink her beliefs? Was it the stories she had heard about what this Joshua bloke's God was doing in defeating any army on the other side of the Jordan that stood in their way to the Promised Land (Genesis 17:8)? Or was it when she met the spies  for the first time and heard their absolute faith in their God that made her realise she needed to change her thinking? Whatever the reason, Rahab didn't just change her mind, she acted upon it. (You can read the full story in Joshua 2:1-6:25) She chose to live differently and put her faith completely in the one true God. What about you?</p>
<p>Have you got a big question that stops you living for God? Take time out today to talk about it to Him and seek out an answer. You might need to take a leaf out of Rahab's book and change your thinking.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['&quot;I know the plans I have for you,&quot; says the Lord. &quot;They are plans for good...&quot;' Jeremiah 29:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>While everybody else was preparing to fight, she was preparing to surrender! Rahab had heard about the things God had done for Israel; how He'd turned the Red Sea to a red carpet, converted rocks into drinking fountains, made breakfast for them every morning in the wilderness and dried up the waters of the Jordan River.</p>
<p>Where Rahab lived, no one believed in God. For a long time she just went with the flow, not stopping and thinking for herself, never questioning what was best-she just tried to fit in. But then she did one very courageous thing: she stood up for what was right and put her trust in God, completely.</p>
<p>Rahab may not have been wise when it came to her body, but she was wiser than everybody else in town when it came to her soul. She wasn't about to fight God-she knew that was a fight you can't win! For her the path to victory was surrender! And that is the right path for you too. If only you stop trying to 'run the show' and turn your life over to Christ, He will take you to places of blessing. Perhaps they'll be places you've always dreamed of but didn't know how to reach. God had a great future for Rahab. He planned to make her not only the ancestor of King David but of Jesus Himself! How's that for restoring? And God, who loves all people from prostitutes to kings and queens, will do the same for you no matter where you've been or what you've done. </p>
<p>Are you going with the flow, against God? Or are you swimming against the crowd, with Him? Decide again who you are going to surrender to, today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God paid a ransom to save you... It was the precious blood of Christ...' 1 Peter 1:18-19 NLT<br /><br /><p>What she trusted in stood, when what everybody else trusted in fell. What did Rahab trust in? Her morality? Nope, the Bible says she was a prostitute. Her nationality? Nope, she was a Gentile, not part of God's people (at least, not then). So what did she trust in? A scarlet cord! It's a picture of the blood Jesus spilt.</p>
<p>As a prostitute, she was probably the last person people thought would to be saved from an entire doomed city. Maybe even she thought that herself-that she was worthless and hopeless. But she trusted only in the scarlet cord to save her. And we need to do that too. If we're worried about how worthless we are, know that just like Rahab, we have to trust only on Jesus' blood. This simply means: Jesus' innocent death was a way of salvation for us. A way out from shame. When Joshua's troops saw the scarlet cord flying from the window of Rahab's home they knew it meant she was under protection. And Christ's blood does that for you. </p>
<p>If you struggle with the idea that you're accepted and protected by God then read 1 John 1:8-9, John 3:16 and Romans 10:9 and see what it says about what God has accomplished for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Anyone who leaves your house will be killed, and it won't be our fault...' Joshua 2:19 CEV<br /><br /><p>She was safe as long as she stayed in the house. Before conquering Jericho, Joshua sent two spies in on a recon mission. That's when they met Rahab and she befriended them. As a result they instructed her to hang a scarlet cord from her window, marking her house as 'off limits' to the invading army. But notice the instructions that were given to her: 'If anyone goes outside your house into the street, they'll be killed!' </p>
<p>There's a lesson here: if you're wondering about getting off your feet and back into church, the message is: 'Get into God's house while you still have time!' If you're drifting away from God, the message is, 'Don't leave the house, guys!' When it comes to being protected, the most important thing is knowing that you're 'in' God. What does that mean? Stay in church. Stay in God's Word. Keep praying. Stay in the company of praying mates who'll build you up spiritually. 'Live under the protection of God Most High and stay in the shadow of God AllPowerful.' (Psalm 91:1 CEV) </p>
<p>If you need to get right with God today, don't let the day end before you do! Don't let yourself worry or procrastinatedo it now! He waits with open arms.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you will soon be bursting at the seams...' Isaiah 54:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>You'll rarely find pridefilled people sharing food or allowing friends to use their phone credit. However they'll often happily chomp away on their friends' chocolates or find emergency reasons to make calls on their phones. They never leave tips when out for a meal. They only buy presents for someone who will give in return, secretly hoping they get the best deal. They put loose change and never notes in the charity box or collection plate. And they always talk themselves out of sponsoring a child from a third world country-after all, their need for that extra $10 a week is always greater. </p>
<p>Another less obvious symptom of the prideful heart is hoarding. Every drawer, cupboard, room in the house is jampacked with stuff they 'just might need'. These people become reluctant to give anything away to help someone in need, just in case they may need it again. Lending belongings is a definite no-no, for fear things will get damaged. Their mindset is gimme-gimme, rather than give and give again. Happy to point this attitude out in other people, they're oblivious to it flourishing in their own. </p>
<p>Isaiah 58:10 GNT says, '...if you give food to the hungry and satisfy those who are in need, then the darkness around you will turn to the brightness of noon.' So no hoarding or stingy living for us; remember: '...you will soon be bursting at the seams...' (Isaiah 54:3 NLT)</p>
<p>Read 2 Corinthians 9:7-9. Think of a way to be exceptionally generous today, then do it. Surprise someone by going beyond their expectations!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is what [God] requires...to do what is right...' Micah 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>'People, the Lord has told you what is good, and this is what He requires of you: to do what is right, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.' The writer of these ancient words was a prophet with a tendency to get straight to the point. God handpicked Micah to deliver a tough message, summed up as follows. 'What on earth are you doing, My people? Pack it in before I pack it in for you!'  When we first start reading the book of Micah it's easy to come to the wrong conclusion about God. He seems to lay down impossible tasks and have ridiculous expectations. But in the last chapter, we discover God loves us and keeps on loving, endlessly helping us by showing us the best way to live:<i> </i><i>'</i><i>Where is another God like you, who pardons the guilt of the remnant, overlooking the </i><i>sins of </i><i>H</i><i>is special people? You will not stay angry with </i><i>Y</i><i>our people forever, because </i><i>Y</i><i>ou delight in showing unfailing love. Once again </i><i>Y</i><i>ou will have compassion on us. You will trample our sins under </i><i>Y</i><i>our feet and throw them into the depths of the ocean! Y</i><i>ou will show us </i><i>Y</i><i>our faithfulness and unfailing love as </i><i>Y</i><i>ou promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.</i>' Micah 7:1820 NLT</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Don't say, &quot;I'm too young&quot;...go wherever I send you...' Jeremiah 1:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>God could have chosen to do His work any way He wanted, but He chose to use ordinary run-of-the-mill <i>people</i>. People like Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah...and you! </p>
<p>God asked Moses, complete with speech impediment, to go and give orders to the ruler of Egypt. God asked Isaiah, a polished city gent, to volunteer for an important mission which would include preaching in his underwear for three years! And God asked Jeremiah, a young bloke, to go speak to a bunch of rebels and risk getting his head kicked in. Moses said, 'I won't,' Isaiah said, 'Woe is me,' and Jeremiah said, 'I can't.'</p>
<p>God supplied tailor-made training courses to turn their 'I won'ts' into 'I wills' and their 'I can'ts' into 'I cans', Likewise God designed you with all the built-in qualifications you need, you don't have to compromise your convictions, manipulate, drop names or do special favours. The part is yours! And don't be jealous or intimidated by anybody else no matter how talented they are. In God's eyes there are no other contenders; you're it! You're the only one who can fill the slot because He created it with you in mind. When you feel insecure and unqualified, remind yourself of that.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...whoever humbles himself will be made great.' Matthew 23:12 GNT<br /><br />
<p>'...I want to talk to You about Your justice. Why do wicked people succeed?...You know me, O Lord. You see me and test my devotion to You. ...people are wicked. They think that God doesn't know what they are doing.' (Jeremiah 12:1-4 GWT) Jeremiah wasn't the first person to ask questions like this. Long before he was born, Job asked similar questions-and Habakkuk did, too. Perhaps you're asking the same sort of questions today?</p>
<p>God's answer to Jeremiah, Job and Habakkuk and all who have asked questions like these is fundamentally the same: <em>'</em><em>Think about where those people are headed; they may look good now, things may appear to be turning out right for them, but how</em><em>'</em><em>s it going to end? Their life may look attractive but it won</em><em>'</em><em>t last indefinitely! Do you honestly want to trade forever with Me</em><em> </em><em>for a bit of wealth or fame now? Do you think it</em><em>'</em><em>s a good idea to get away with whatever you want now and lose out on being in Heaven with Me? Those people are lost and they</em><em>'</em><em>ve chosen to ignore me, but you have all you need from me and everything you do f</em><em>o</em><em>r me I will use for your good.</em><em>'</em><em> </em></p>
<p>God says, '...whoever humbles himself will be made great.' Don't look around at what everyone else is 'getting away with'-look to God and see all the possibilities.</p>
<p>Why not take a moment to <em>count your blessings</em> and list some of the good things that you've experienced as a child of God and say 'thanks'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But they all...began to make excuses...' Luke 14:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In Luke 14, Jesus tells the parable of a man giving a great banquet. The invitation to the banquet represents the Gospel, and the man hosting the banquet represents God. Jesus says that many were invited but when party time came, those who had been invited made excuses.</p>
<p>'The first said... &quot;I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.&quot;' (v18) Sounds pretty feeble, doesn't it? If you'd just bought a block of land, you'd think that you'd have had a look <i>before</i> buying it! When it came to it, the bloke preferred to revel in his wealth than do anything else. </p>
<p>This was no takeaway joint lunch he was turning his nose up at. This was food like no other, served at the Host's mansion. It's easy to laugh at this bloke who couldn't see the worth of what he was giving up. But what about us? </p>
<p>Even when we have seen the worth of Jesus, accepted His invitation for salvation and know what it's like to hang out with God, we frequently still make excuses for not giving Him our time when we should. Philippians 4:19 NIV says: 'And my God will meet all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.' God wants our time, but too often we give Him our excuses.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['While I was busy doing something else...' 1 Kings 20:40 NLT<br /><br /><p>There are several ways we can discover that it is dangerous to jump off a ten-story building: (1) you can read about the law of gravity in a book; (2) You can learn from the sad experience of someone else who tried it; (3) You can listen to the wise counsel of a firefighter or physician who claims it would be 'hazardous to your health'; ( 4) You can jump. </p>
<p>Each way provides the information you are seeking; the only difference is the amount of pain involved in gaining that information. An unknown prophet had a message from God to King Ahab: it was about being busy doing his own thing. God wanted Ahab to learn that He alone is Lord over everything. God gave Ahab lots of great ways to learn this important life lesson, but Ahab chose the hardest option of all. It cost him his life. King Ahab got distracted and, as a result, he did the opposite of what God had asked him to do. </p>
<p>Keep your eye on the ball, don't get distracted. The Bible says, 'Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NLT) If Satan can't 'devour' you with a frontal assault, he'll settle for diverting you with things that ultimately don't matter. Keep your eyes fixed on Jesus. Don't be distracted. Don't end up being 'busy doing something else.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have finished my course.' 2 Timothy 4:7 NAS<br /><br /><p>Right now it probably seems like you've got your whole life in front of you. The world is full of fresh opportunities, great adventures and exciting people to meet. If life was a race, you'd have kilometres of track in front of you. But here's the thing: not everybody who starts the run finishes it. If you want to stay the distance, you need to beware of potential hurdles. </p>
<p>At the first hurdle, you may find that close 'go-for-it' mates start to stumble. Some give up or give in to temptation; others don't like the way the Christian path is taking them. Just like in Jesus' day: 'many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.' (John 6:66 NKJ) </p>
<p>By the second hurdle, you may start to feel the burn. Running with God isn't all warm glows and praise sessions. Sometimes God purposefully takes you through tough times: 'Everyone who wants to live as God desires, in Christ Jesus, will be hurt.' (2 Timothy 3:12 NCV) All runners hit the wall at some point-the important thing is to keep on running.</p>
<p>Our final hurdle is opposition. People, situations, losses-opposition comes in different disguises. Often opposition is an indicator that God is about to bless you. In order to finish strong you mustn't quit: face each challenge and keep running in the face of opposition. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He guides the humble in what is right.' Psalm 25:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>God can be so frustrating at times! Especially when He won't play ball. Like, you know, you'd be much happier with that girlfriend/boyfriend. You'd be really great at that high paying job and you could give more away. Like, there must be some kind of mix-up between the life you've been given and the life you want. Sure, He's the creator of the universe, the knower of all things and wears time around His wrist...but if He'd just consult you now and again, things would be just right. Is that really too much to ask? </p>
<p>When you don't like the way God is leading, do you pray, hoping that God will come round to your way of thinking? Praying is more about getting the mind of God rather than the things on our shopping list. Jesus said, 'I am the vine, you are the branches.' (John 15:5 NKJ) Only as you stay connected to Christ will you bear fruit. Just as the life flows from the vine into the branches, so His power flows to you. David wrote, 'The Lord is good and does what is right; He shows the proper path to those who go astray. He leads the humble in what is right, teaching them His way.' (Psalm 25:8-9 NLT) </p>
<p>God will show you what the 'right' direction for you is, if you look for Him. Basically, there are only two ways-God's way or the wrong way. Which way? You choose!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God has made me laugh' Genesis 21:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Sarah laughed twice. The first time it was in unbelief because in her old age God had promised her a child. The second time it was with joy because God had fulfilled His promise. But between these two events she went through the most wrenching experience of her life. Her husband, Abraham, betrayed her to save himself. A heathen king took her to his harem and would have violated her had God not intervened. There's a great lesson here. Between praying for a miracle and getting one, you'll be tested, you'll grow, and you'll learn to trust God more than you ever thought possible. Plus, here's something else important here too: when you share your experiences with others don't just tell the start and the finish; instead, tell them what God brought you through, because those are the very things they're struggling with too. Be honest. Tell them how your faith was tried. Don't leave them feeling a failure because they haven't yet seen God's promise like you have. The King's tent where Sarah spent that terrifying night was in a place called Gerar, which means 'the halting place'. Yes, there'll be times when you'll feel like your life has come to a screeching halt and you're getting nowhere. Maybe that's where you are today. But know this: God always comes true on His promises. Always. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will sit as a refiner...of silver' Malachi 3:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Inside a crucible, silver is heated by a refiner. The scum in the metal rises and is drawn off by the silversmith until every impurity is burnt away. Finally, the refiner's keen eye knows the silver is ready to pour when it becomes like a mirror. It is so clean he can see his own face reflected back from the surface. </p>
<p>Malachi hints that troubles and life's mess can be used to help us clean up our act. It's tempting to think that when the heat is turned up in our lives it's somehow punishment for some wrong we've done. However it could be exactly the opposite. We pray to be more like Jesus, so God turns up the furnace to burn away all our impurities. Often a tough time in life is followed by a great opportunity for serving God. Why? Because God has used your problem to get you ready for His service. There's nothing like a spot of trouble to draw you closer to God. The challenge is to see beyond the problem. </p>
<p>The worst thing the prodigal son could have done was to make his bed and draw his curtains in the pigsty. He wasn't made for life as a pig-he just had to experience life at the bottom in order to look to the top. Maybe you're in the fire now: hurting, melting, burning. The refiner's fire is not to be avoided. To escape it is to escape your destiny and to escape God. Hold on, you'll soon be reflecting the face of God with your life. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have given you authority...to overcome...the enemy.' Luke 10:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Now here's a picture for you: at the end of World War II, General MacArthur met the supreme commander of the beaten Japanese forces. He took the sword out of the general's arms to signal the commander's defeat. He then enforced the terms of unconditional surrender. Victory was declared publicly. </p>
<p>You know what? Jesus did that for you at the cross. Jesus said, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven. I have given you authority...to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.' (Luke 10:18-19 NIV) Notice you haven't been called to <i>defeat</i> Satan; Jesus already did that 2000 years ago. You have been called to <i>enforce</i> His defeat each day. Jesus already disarmed and made a public spectacle of him at the cross (Colossians 2:15). That means Satan can't keep you from your destiny. </p>
<p>When Jesus died and rose again He stripped the devil of his power and declared, 'All [power] in Heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go.' (Matthew 28:18-19 NIV) Go in His power. Go in His strength. Go in His name. He has given you authority over the enemy-use it. </p>
<p>'At one time you were separated from God. You were His enemies in your minds, and the evil things you did were against God. But now God has made you His friends again. He did this through Christ's death.' (Colossians 1:21-22 NCV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, open my servant's eyes, and let him see.' 2 Kings 6:17 NCV<br /><br /><p>The Bible tells us the story of Elisha's servant. He got up early in the morning but when he went outside he was confronted with the sight of a huge army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. He knew they were there for Elisha. This wasn't cool-but Elisha was. </p>
<p>While the servant was freaking out just looking at the size of the king of Syria's army, Elisha said, 'Don't worry, those with us are more than those who are with them.' </p>
<p>'<i>And Elisha prayed, and said, </i><i>LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.</i><i> Then the LORD opened the eyes of... [Elisha's servant] and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha</i>.' 2 Kings 6:17 </p>
<p>Often our problem is that we, like Elisha's servant, sometimes only see the physical problems. We get thrown by money and circumstances and people. Instead we need to learn to 'open our eyes' like Elisha. We need to know that there are many more on our side than those against us. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love is patient and kind.' 1 Corinthians 13:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>Most of us are fond of the odd chunk or two (make that bar or two) of chocolaty loveliness. With a name like chocolate it has to be good, right?</p>
<p>The advertising world encourages us to 'spoil, treat, relax, indulge' with... chocolate! To attract that special someone's attention you need to 'make the face you love light up' with... chocolate! In the advertising world chocolate symbolises love. To love yourself and to love others you need... chocolate!</p>
<p>Truth is, chocolate, once it's out of that wrapper, doesn't last long. It satisfies only a moment- before heading straight for your hips to taunt you. Not even a whole box of the stuff can make the object of your desire fall head over heels in love with you. </p>
<p>If you want to know what real love is, you have to go to the main source. 1 John 4:8 tells us, 'God is love' and this is what God says real love is like: 'patient and kind...not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.' (1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NLT)</p>
<p>God's love always satisfies and never disappoints. God lavishes His love on you. So indulge yourself. Know from Him what it means to love and be loved. And have a lovely day!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God will generously provide all you need.' 2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>You've probably seen <i>Man vs Wild </i>the television series where Bear Grylls demonstrates his wilderness skills in some of the world's most menacing environments. Want to know how to survive the world's worst? Bear is your man! In total contrast, the MTV reality series <i>My Super Sweet 16</i> documents huge coming-of-age celebrations thrown by teenagers and their (usually extremely wealthy) parents. The show has been criticised for its excesses and the effects of presenting such over-the-top parties as an inspirational norm. </p>
<p>Neither show gives us a picture of a good way to live: one extreme leaves us coping and struggling, grabbing what we can in order to survive; the other smothers us in self-indulgence with no real sense of value or purpose. God's way doesn't leave us wanting, wondering if we'll make it; nor does it leave us spending without any care or concern.</p>
<p>Let's live out God's extreme way of life, knowing that 'God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.' Living God's extreme means: (1) Trusting God to provide all you need-don't walk around struggling, feeling hopeless. When you need it, He promises you'll have it. Live like it! (2) Giving generously-this is no time for stinginess. Give with purpose what God has given you to those in need. Give and you'll be given more so you can give more. Now that's extreme!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love cannot be drowned by oceans or floods.' Song of Solomon 8:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>We've all seen the horrific devastation a tsunami brings. News footage has recorded how a picture-perfect coastal town can be swept away under the force of an ocean wall and homes, businesses, lives destroyed. Water is a powerful force with the ability to be so gentle young children can freely play in it or so strong it wounds, maims and breaks anything in its way. </p>
<p>The Bible talks of another force that can operate at both ends of the extreme-and on a much larger scale! This force is God's love, so strong it 'cannot be drowned by oceans or floods.' </p>
<p>It is gentle enough to heal the tenderest broken heart, it is strong enough to withstand the cruellest barrage of hate. It is full of compassion and mercy yet it is also what drove Jesus to give His life on the cross. Amazingly God's love is freely available to all-will you accept it? In a world where so many negative forces are at work it is very easy to feel unloved and unlovable. Know today that God is here and He loves you. As St Augustine wrote, 'He loves each one of us as if there were only one of us.' In a world that can be difficult and relationships damaging, use love. God's love is so powerful it changes any situation for any individual for the better.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Even in old age they will...remain vital...' Psalm 92:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>If someone were to ask you today to make a list of all the important, vital things you need in life, would the elderly be on your list? Or do you think the silver-haired brigade have no relevance to you whatsoever? If you constantly feel like you're being shot down for being young, hanging out with the oldies might be the last thing you want to do. </p>
<p>The older generation can get a bad press, thought of as 'past their use-by date', no longer important. But God thinks differently. In the Bible God promises many good things to those who are older, like special God-knowledge and insight into people and life. </p>
<p>And it's not just the youthful God uses to do the spectacular. Moses was aged 80 when he was used to free thousands of slaves. Can you imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him and watch him fight the ruler of Egypt using frogs and extreme acne? Or being there when he parted the sea with a stick? Moses actually saw God face-to-face and is the only person on record as having God as his undertaker (Deuteronomy 34 tells it all).</p>
<p>So show some respect and chill out with the oldies that hang out with God-you might be amazed at the difference it will make to your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This man truly was the Son of God!' Mark 15:39 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>I'll never forget that day. I much prefer to remember the week before, when Jesus came to my town. Everyone was talking about Him. He was performing miracles and saying things that really challenged people's thinking. As He came through our city gates, everyone cheered, 'Hail Jesus, King of the Jews!' </i></p>
<p><i>But days later, He'd been arrested. I couldn't find out why, but they were going to let us choose between a thug named Barabbas and Jesus. You'd think everyone would shout to release Jesus, right? But one person shouted 'Barabbas!', then another, and soon it was everyone. Even I was shouting, 'Barabbas, free Barabbas!' I don't know why I did it. I'm not the sort to go along with the crowd. Why didn't I stop and think for myself? </i></p>
<p><i>The next time I saw Jesus, I hardly recognised Him. His whole face was swollen and bruised- they'd beaten Him up real bad. He had blood running down His head from where they'd stuck a crown of thorns. They laughed and said it was a joke, but it didn't look funny to me. </i></p>
<p><i>A soldier asked some guy to help carry Jesus' cross-I suppose that's one good thing that happened that day, but not the only good thing. When they were nailing Jesus to a cross He said, 'Father, forgive them for they don't know what they're doing.' While He was there, dying, He was thinking of us, asking God to forgive us...to forgive me.</i></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will not believe it until I...put my finger where the nails were.' John 20:25 NCV<br /><br /><p>You know the sort of person who never lets the truth spoil a good story? Some people will lie through their teeth to get people believe the ridiculous. And the story of Jesus coming back to life sounded, well, ridiculous to one of the disciples.</p>
<p><i>What could be more ridiculous than a dead man coming back to life-who's going to believe that? It's not something you see every day, is it? And how dare someone start spreading that kind of rumour? We're all just trying to come to terms with what's just happened and figure out how we're going to get by without Him. </i></p>
<p>Similar thoughts were probably running through the mind of Thomas. No matter who told him, he just wouldn't believe Jesus had come back to life again: 'I will not believe it until I...put my finger where the nails were.' Thomas needed some extra proof-positive that Jesus really had died and come back to life again. </p>
<p>Jesus didn't let Thomas down. He turns up and shows His scars, so Thomas can believe. If you're struggling to believe Jesus is alive and wants to have a friendship with you, don't give up: 'If...you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him if you look for Him with all your heart and with all your soul.' (Deuteronomy 4:29 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...presented Himself alive...by many infallible proofs.' Acts 1:3 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Thanks to chocolate companies, Easter has become a choc fest. We enjoy it to the full, stuffing our faces with a variety of Easter egg delights. You probably know how many eggs you got, how many you've already eaten and whether there are any more still to come. But do you know why we give each other eggs? </p>
<p>Giving eggs at Easter celebrates new life. It's a way of remembering that Jesus, after dying on the cross, rose from the dead. In doing this, He defeated death and sin and offers us the promise of eternal life: 'Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In God's great mercy He has caused us to be born again into a living hope, because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. Now we hope for the blessings God has for His children. These blessings...cannot be destroyed [and]...are kept in Heaven for you.' (1 Peter 1:3-4 NCV) This is not just nice idea- this is real, infallible truth! </p>
<p>Scientists say that infallible proof comes from getting the same result from repeated experiments and multiple confirmations. Here are five infallible proofs that Jesus rose from the dead. One: Mary Magdalene encountered Him. Two: the women at the grave saw Him. Three: the disciples talked with Him. Four: the apostles met Him. Five: 500 people witnessed Him at one time. </p>
<p>Don't just munch your way through a mountain of chocolate this Easter, discover the amazing truth for your life: 'If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' (Romans 10:9 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pay attention to what you hear.' Luke 8:18 NLT<br /><br /><p>Most people love the sound of their own voice but it has been said that he who speaks much is much mistaken. James 1:19 NLT says we 'should be quick to listen and slow to speak.' Look through the book of Proverbs and you'll discover why: 'Anyone who answers without listening is foolish' (18:13 NCV); 'A simpleton can learn only by seeing mockers punished; a wise person learns from instruction.' (21:11 NLT); 'Intelligent people are always open to new ideas.' (18:15 NLT)</p>
<p>We may have the ability to hear but the art of listening is an important skill to develop, and the reason we need to develop this skill the most is found in Proverbs 3:5 NLT: 'Seek His will in all you do, and He will direct your paths.' </p>
<p>Three things you need to know about listening: (1) Listening doesn't happen naturally; it is a conscious choice. Choose today to improve your listening skills. Stop talking and start listening out for God's voice. (2) Listening may appear easy but it is often hard work. Don't panic if after five minutes you haven't heard God at all, it can take time to know God's voice. Enjoy the journey of discovery. (3) True listening requires you give another person your attention and possibly change your attitudes as you listen. 'Let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do.' (Romans 12:2 NLT) Are you listening?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Oh, give thanks to the God of gods! For His mercy endures forever.'  Psalm 136:2 NJKV<br /><br /><p>When life goes pear-shaped do you become a disgruntled wreck or are you like the missionary Paul-sorted? He wrote: 'I have learned how to be content with whatever I have...I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength' (Philippians 4:11-13 NLT)</p>
<p>What if, at the age of 46, you were burned beyond recognition in a terrible motorcycle accident, and then four years later were paralysed from the waist down in an airplane crash? Can you imagine yourself becoming a millionaire, respected public speaker, happy newlywed and a successful business person? Can you see yourself going white water rafting, skydiving and becoming a politician? W. Mitchell has done all these things and more after two horrible accidents left his face a quilt of multicoloured skin grafts, his hands fingerless and his legs thin and motionless in a wheelchair. 'Before I was paralysed,' he said, 'there were 10000 things I could do. Now there are 9000. I can either dwell on the 1000 I lost or focus on the 9000 I have left.' He too had learnt the life-changing effect of being content in any situation. What about you? Take a step back. Get a wider view of your life. Look at the things holding you back, leaving you feeling angry or unsettled. Maybe they aren't so bad after all. Remember it's not what happens to you: it's what you do about it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love never gives up; and its faith, hope, and patience never fail.' 1 Corinthians 13:4 GNT<br /><br /><p>Gram Seed lay dying in a hospital. 'I'd become the tramp that nobody sees,' he recalls, 'from a broken family living in a rough part of town. A life of crime allowed me to be both rich and powerful but inside I was hurting, insecure and angry. After the confinement of prison walls I...made a public bench my home... I became so desperate I wanted to end my life, so I slashed my wrists...but I was soon back on my bench... It wasn't long after that that I collapsed and was put on a life-support machine.'</p>
<p>Gram's life would have ended there and then if it weren't for two young guys who acted on God's words: 'love cares more for others than of self.' Not only did they go to Gram when he lived on that bench telling him, 'Jesus loves you,' they went to visit him in hospital every day for two months. They prayed for him and read the Bible to him.</p>
<p>'When I got out, I gave my life to the Lord,' says Gram. 'In God's amazing providence I now head up <i>Sowing Seeds Ministries</i> which aims to help ex-offenders, just like me, not only to find a better way of life but to realise that true freedom can only be found through the love of a Saviour, and that Saviour is my Lord and my Friend Jesus Christ... Every time I walk past that bench I thank God that He knew my address and sent someone to tell me about Jesus.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each part...helps the other parts grow.' Ephesians 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>When life goes belly up, it's then we find out who our true friends are. True friends walk in when others walk out. Real friends don't care if your socks don't match. Real friends don't walk ten steps behind you if you're having a bad hair day. Real friends are those who, when you've made a fool of yourself, don't feel that you've done a permanent job. But how do you stand by your friends when things go wrong, when situations become awkward or difficult?</p>
<p>God wants us to work together to bring out the best in each other as, 'each part...helps the other parts grow.' But how can you bring out the best in your friend when it feels like they're bringing out the worst in you? </p>
<p>When it looks like one of your friends is in serious trouble or heading that way, we can do one of five things:</p>
<p>(1) Ditch them-you've got plenty of other friends you don't need them; (2) Join them-you don't want anything to ruin the friendship, so you think behaving like them will help; (3) Act two-faced, being nice to their face but gossiping about them behind their back; (4) Pretend the problem will go away, carrying on as though nothing is wrong; or, the only real choice, (5) Be honest with them, tell them you're concerned and do all you can to help. Proverbs 17:17 NIV says 'a friend loves at all times.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have been crucified with Christ.' Galatians 2:20 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When we are under attack our survival instinct kick in. It's natural but it creates a problem. Paul says, 'I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.' If we default to self-preservation, we aren't free to make the right decisions. We'll do things based on what we think 'feels good', or is 'acceptable to others', rather than what God wants us to do. We've got to 'die to self': '...unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies [to self], it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.' (John 12:24 NAS)There are people in the Bible who missed out on God's best because they were looking out for their own interests rather than God's. Without considering Abraham, Lot chose the well-watered plains of Jordan, and lost his family (Genesis 13:10-11). The rich young ruler could have been numbered among Christ's disciples, but he'd too much to lose (Mark 10:22). Often, the more we have, the tighter we hold on. Jesus said, 'Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses [invests] his life for My sake...will save it.' (Luke 9:24 NAS)Paul wrote, 'I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me...' (Acts 20:24 NIV). The safest place to be-the only place to be-is in the will of God! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each part...helps the other parts grow.' Ephesians 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>Mates, pals, chums, buddies, amigos, allies, your BFF, soul mate, kindred spirit-friends. When cutting up your cake of life this is one of the biggest slices of all. They make you laugh, they keep you sane and they help you pick up the pieces when it all goes wrong. You can't choose your family, but you can choose your mates, and hopefully you've made some good choices along the way.</p>
<p>But what do you do when your mates have gone strange on you? What's your response when they come to you, their loyal friend, to back them in a bad idea? What happens when they head down the path of doom asking you, their BFF, to support them in a nutty career? Do you just smile in agreement because you don't want to upset them? Leave them to make fools of themselves because it's their life they're ruining, not yours? </p>
<p>The Bible talks about God wanting us to work together to bring out the best in each other: 'As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.' Are you brave enough to be honest with your friends to help them make good choices? They say the best vitamin for developing friends is B1. Will you <i>be one</i>-the kind of friend who always brings out the best in others? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each part...helps the other parts grow.' Ephesians 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>They say it's smart to pick your friends-but not to pieces. So be careful when you're trying to bring out the best in your friends (like God asks us to) that you don't end up ripping them to shreds. Before you go wading in, check your motives. Do you want to correct your friend for all the right reasons-or are you trying to make yourself look good? Do you want to build them up-or are you trying to knock them down a peg or two? The world needs more warm hearts and fewer hot heads, so no bouncing in and starting a mudslinging match. </p>
<p>When someone accepts us as their friend it means we've earned their trust and respect. Don't be quick to spend that all at once. Proverbs 27:6 NIV says: 'wounds from a friend can be trusted.' Friendship puts us in a position where we can say things that, at times, are difficult but needed. But if we go in all-guns-blazing or with selfish or ulterior motives, then rather than help a friend we're more likely to lose a friend. </p>
<p>If done in the right way, a real friend will eventually thank you for pointing out where they're going wrong. They'll come to understand you had their best interests at heart. If there's a tough situation you need to confront a friend about, think about how you're going to do it first. Then ask yourself this question: if you were that friend, would you want to be friends with you? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I do not claim that I...have already become perfect.' Philippians 3:12 GNT<br /><br /><p>What matters most to you right now? Top exam results-anything below an A+ is not acceptable? Having that dream car, dream job and supercool friends? Do you go ape if your makeup gets smudged or a hair falls out of place? If you do, it sounds like you could be suffering from perfectionitis. </p>
<p>The world tells us we have to be the best and have the best, so we pressure ourselves chasing after perfection-and are often left with a big F for Failure! Pressure yourself into the world's idea of perfection and you're going to miss out on living! Think about it: for most things in life there is a perfect standard to aim for-from how we treat waiters, shop assistants, strangers or family to how we use our money, time or words and on to how compassionate, understanding, supportive or hardworking we are. </p>
<p>Paul had a few words to say on this kind of attitude: 'I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection! But I keep working toward that day when I will finally be all that Christ Jesus saved me for and wants me to be.' (Philippians 3:12 NLT) You're not perfect yet, but you will be. So chill and enjoy the journey. Hand your life over to Jesus and live each day with Him. He'll turn your imperfections into His perfection. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue' Psalm 39:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>You know the score: it starts off as a cosy chat between friends ('My sister's pregnant and I'm so happy; I can't wait to be an auntie...') and it's wrongly overheard; rumours are soon around the school: 'Cecilia in Year 9 is pregnant-again!' </p>
<p>Now this may sound funny-unless you're Cecilia. Having slanderous accusations thrown around about you is never fun. For all kind of reasons, usually insecurities, people are wrongly confronted with some outrageous untruth about themselves or their family. Our natural response is to fly off the handle and 'give the lying little brat what for!' </p>
<p>It's extremely difficult to keep silent when others tear us down. We want to protect our reputation. It's not easy to stay silent while others assault something so precious to us. But we don't need to lash out in revenge or justify our position; we can trust God to protect our reputation. Romans 8:31-37 NIV says: 'If God is for us who can be against us?... who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?... Shall trouble or hardship or persecution... No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.' </p>
<p>Jesus was silent before His accusers (Luke 23:9). He left His case in God's hands (1 Peter 2:21-24). This is a good place to leave our case too. Don't fight slander with anger. Trust God and pray, 'guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Everyone's work will be put through the fire.' 1 Corinthians 3:13 TLB<br /><br /><p>One day an ox said to a mule, 'Let's pretend to be sick.' The mule said, 'No, we need to get this work done.' The ox feigned illness, and the farmer brought him fresh hay. When the mule came in from ploughing, the ox asked how things went. The mule said, 'All right.' The ox asked, 'What did the farmer say about me?' The mule replied, 'Nothing.' The next day the ox pretended to be ill again. When the mule came home the ox asked, 'How did it go?' The mule said, 'All right.' After a week of this, the ox asked, 'Did the farmer say anything about me today?' The mule replied, 'Well, he said nothing to me personally, but he stopped and had a long talk with the butcher!' </p>
<p>Are you like that ox-shirking work? Ephesians 2:10 TLB says: 'We are God's masterpiece...created...so we can do the good things He planned for us.' So we need to get on with it and forget about pulling sickies. Everything we do or don't do has consequences. The Bible tells us: 'There is going to come a time of testing at the Judgment Day to see what kind of work each...has done. Everyone's work will be put through the fire to see whether or not it keeps its value.' So 'think of ways to encourage one another to outbursts of love and good deeds.' (Hebrews 10:24 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will lift up your face without shame.' Job 11:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>You know those times when nothing seems to go right and the whole world seems to tell us we're a waste of space?</p>
<p>No one understood this more than Job. He was one of those people who had it all. Everything you could want in life, he had it-great job, wonderful kids, stunning wife, good friends. He wanted for nothing. Then he lost the lot! Apart from his wife, that is. But going through such extreme hardship and loss didn't make that relationship easy. He couldn't make sense of it; he wished he'd never been born. </p>
<p>But one thing that Job never did was blame God. Sure, he questioned Him, he tried to find some understanding of why his life had turned upside down. He tried to grab some peace in the torment of each day. But he never blamed God and always clung to Him in belief and trust. Even when his friends deserted him and his health took a nosedive, he kept hanging on to God. Eventually Job came out on top. The book with his name on it says: 'If you devote your heart to [God]...you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.' Don't stop believing-God will come through for you too. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['His divine power has given us everything we need for...a godly life.' 2 Peter 1:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you been brushing up on your three R's lately? <i>R</i>eading, (w)<i>R</i>iting and (a)<i>R</i>ithmetic? How are your mathematical skills? If they've grown a little dusty then 2 Peter 1 is your dust-buster. In the space of one chapter you will learn some spiritual mathematics.</p>
<p>In verses 5-8, you discover seven things you need to <i>add</i> to your life: 'For this reason make every effort to add to your faith, goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure they will keep you from becoming ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.' (Write down those seven qualities so you don't forget them.) </p>
<p>Then it's straight onto some <i>subtraction</i>. 'Those who fail to develop these virtues...have already forgotten that God has cleansed them from their old life of sin.' We need to stop doing sinful things, subtract sin from our lives, stop going our own way and do life God's way. The more we add those seven qualities into our everyday lives the more we will subtract the sin. Every day, do the maths-your spiritual maths, that is! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us cross over to the other side.' Mark 4:35 NKJ<br /><br /><p>At times Jesus gave His disciples special inside knowledge and understanding on stuff He was saying, which gave them a buzz of excitement or a headache, like their brain couldn't develop fast enough to fit the information in. Then they had experiences like the day Jesus said to them, 'Let's cross over to the other side.' So off they sailed, but it was no easy trip: 'A fierce storm arose. High waves began to break into the boat until it was nearly full of water.' (Mark 4:37 NLT)</p>
<p>They were petrified; their short lives were flashing before their eyes. Jesus wasn't at all scared, though-they had to wake Him up before He saw the commotion. Then they watched in amazement as Jesus told the weather to stop playing up-and it did! But then Jesus made them realise they needed to grow up, 'Why are you so afraid? Do you still not have faith in Me?'</p>
<p>God wants us to be 'no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead...grow up.' (Ephesians 4:14-15 NIV) Jesus wants you to grow up, trusting Him in every situation no matter how stormy life gets, trusting His words no matter how many people rock the boat with their untruths, trusting Him no matter how what circumstances try to blow us off course.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you are tempted, He will show you a way out.' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Excuses, excuses, excuses: we all make them when temptation strikes. We fall for it, get caught and then it's 'I've been set up, officer, honest! He made me do it! I didn't have a choice!'</p>
<p>They say opportunity knocks only once but temptation leans on the doorbell and often kicks the door down! We don't get tempted because we're evil; we're tempted because we're human. So expect temptation to happen-and learn how to handle it. Here are three things God wants you to know about temptation:</p>
<p>(1) 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience.' So don't kid yourself that you're different from anyone else, or that your situation makes it more difficult for you. We're all in the same boat, if one person can resist-so can you.</p>
<p>(2) 'God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand.' So don't fool yourself in believing that it was too hard and you had to fold under the weight of it. God never goes back on His promises; if He says you can resist it-you can. </p>
<p>(3) 'When you are tempted, He will show you a way out.' So refuse to believe there's no other option. Instead look around, think outside the box, ask God to show you an alternative route. If He says there's another way-there is! And once God has locked the door on your temptation, don't go climbing through the window. Run from temptation and don't leave a forwarding address.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The person who is put right with God through faith shall live.' Romans 1:17 GNT<br /><br /><p>We all believe in things we can't see: like oxygen! We believe it's there to breathe even though we can't see it. If we can have faith in oxygen, we can have faith in God. As 2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV says: 'we live by faith, not by sight.' </p>
<p>The bungee jumper hurtles from a great height with faith in the bungee cord to save him from death. We too can have faith that God will save us: John 3:16-17 NLT says 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. God did not send His Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it.' </p>
<p>We can't see the wind or electricity, but the effects of these make us believe it to be real. In a similar way we can see the effects God makes in people's lives and have the faith to believe He is real. John 4:39 NIV says, 'Many...believed in Him because of the woman's testimony.' </p>
<p>We can take a piece of cheap yellowish plastic to a shop, expecting we can exchange it for a new shirt. We've got faith that the new shirt will be ours because the cheap yellowish plastic is a $50 note with the full backing of the Reserve Bank behind it. So we can also read God's Word and have faith that He will fully back all the promises He has made (over 3000 of them). Hebrews 11:1 NIV says: 'faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are God's fellow workers.' 1 Corinthians 3:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's been said that the only workout some folks get is jumping to conclusions, running down their friends, sidestepping their responsibility and pushing their luck! Back in the day when Paul was around, the church in Corinth was full of people like that-pulling each other to pieces, moaning, complaining and picking sides, saying one Christian leader was better than another. So Paul has a word: 'The Lord has assigned each to his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow...we are God's fellow-workers.' (1 Corinthians 3:5-9 NIV)</p>
<p>Paul puts them in their place, reminding us all that we are to work together with God, not fight against each other. After all, it's God who does the miraculous, not us! Where would we be without God? What can we achieve without God? God is the amazing one; only He 'is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.' (Ephesians 3:20 NIV) </p>
<p>If you lose sight of what working with God is all about, try remembering the words of J. John who, when asked what he did for a living, replied, 'WelI, I work for a global enterprise with outlets in nearly every country of the world; we've got hospitals, hospices, homeless shelters; we do justice work, reconciliation work, orphanages, marriage guidance counselling... basically we look after people from birth to death... It's called the church.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not despise...small beginnings.' Zechariah 4:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Walking along the road you see five cents on the ground-what do you do? Walk past it, leave it where it is-after all it's only five cents, why bother? What would happen if that coin were a $50 note? Would you ignore it? You'd want to pick it up, wouldn't you? You'd want to do something about it, you couldn't just leave it lying there-it's worth enough to buy something! </p>
<p>In a world that constantly says, 'bigger is better,' it's easy to ignore the little things in life. It's easy to think you can't do anything because you don't have enough, aren't talented enough, or don't know enough. It's easy to get fed up, frustrated and pack it in because it's taking too long, you feel you're not getting anywhere or your efforts aren't amounting to much. </p>
<p>The Bible says, 'Do not despise...small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin.' God always sees the potential in you. So notice the small things, take care of the little things, do the tiny things you can do. You'll find they are just as valuable and just as important. All things that become great started small.</p>
<p>Do this for others too: start passing on small words of encouragement and compliments. Watch how attitudes change as others see you seeking to build them up, rather than trying to tear them down. Little things like a word of encouragement can help others achieve their massive potential.</p>

<p>You may not be familiar with the psychedelic 70s musical <i>Godspell</i>, but its lyrics are full of God's Word, based on Matthew's Gospel. The point is that if you're in the dark, you don't have a light just to hide it away. If you've been given talents (and you have), you've been given them by God to be used for His glory.</p>
<p>You might be familiar with the Parable of the Talents found in Matthew 25:14-30, involving three servants each given different amounts to invest wisely. When the master returns, the first two servants have doubled their investments. But the last servant, who'd only been entrusted with the least amount, had buried it. When asked what the deal was, he could only reply, 'Master, I knew that you were a hard man. You harvest things you did not plant. You gather crops where you did not sow any seed. So I was afraid and went and hid your money in the ground. Here is your bag of gold.'...<b> T</b>he master said, 'Throw that useless servant outside.' (Matthew 25:24-25, 30 NCV) </p>
<p>Conquering the fear of failure begins with believing: 'If God is for us, who can ever be against us?' (Romans 8:31 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your leader will break out...He will bring you through.' Micah 2:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>What do you think about when you're not thinking about anything? What goes through your mind before you fall asleep? Where does your mind focus when you wake up? What do you think about when you get some 'head space'? Your thoughts reflect your character and reveal what you're most passionate about. </p>
<p>Is your mind full of doom and gloom? Or a bit like the villains of the <i>Batman</i> movies-like the Joker or the Penguin, daily consumed with planning more dastardly deeds? The Bible lets us know that negative thinking produces a negative result. This is why we're encouraged in Philippians 4:8 NLT: 'Fix your thoughts on what is true and honourable and right. Think about things that are pure lovely and admirable...excellent and worthy of praise.' </p>
<p>This is easier said than done, but well done you! By reading <i>word4U2day</i> today you've made a great choice! When your brain feels wired for a 24/7 worry party or comes up with a creative solution to your circumstances involving 'payback time'. Colossians 3:2 says; 'Let Heaven fill your thoughts.' When we become passionate about things of God He promises to set us straight. 'Your leader will break out...He will bring you through...Your King will lead you; the Lord Himself will guide you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Examine me, O God, and know my mind.' Psalm 139:23 GNT<br /><br /><p>The bravest prayer in the Bible is believed to be David's prayer in Psalm 139-is your heart brave enough to pray this? 'Examine me, O God, and know my mind; test me, and discover my thoughts. Find out if there is any evil in me and guide me in the everlasting way.'</p>
<p>Eek! Allowing God to have a rummage under your bed? God already knows your deepest darkest moments, what goes on in your head, what you get up to with your mates, what you do when no one is looking-but actually asking Him to fill out a feedback sheet on what He thinks? Daring to let Him compare your life, your actions and your attitudes to His? Now that's scary! No one's going to come out looking good praying a prayer like that, are they? So why pray it? Why ask to be put under a microscope?</p>
<p>We only really recognise where we're going wrong when God points it out. We're forever making excuses about the stuff we do wrong. We can end up believing it's ok, acceptable, even right! But when we allow God to poke around and take over our mess, something incredible happens. Romans 8: 5-6 GNT tells us, 'Those who live as the Spirit tells them to, have their minds controlled by what the Spirit wants. To be controlled by human nature results in death; to be controlled by the Spirit results in life and peace.' It's not only the bravest prayer, but the best prayer too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Old people will have dreams...young people will see visions.' Joel 2:28 GNT<br /><br /><p>Being a Christian is the best. There's nothing like it, no better way of living. Romans 10:11 NAS says, 'Anyone who trusts in Him will never be disappointed...' Plus it's available to all-God leaves no one out, not even you. Romans 10:13 NIV says, 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' </p>
<p>Sure, life has its moments-but knowing Jesus makes a massive difference to all the tough stuff. Romans 5:3 NLT tells us, 'We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials.' And there's more! God promises to let us in on His thoughts, give us special knowledge to see what He's up to, let us in on what He's doing: 'I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.'</p>
<p>Do you want to be in the know? Then start asking God today to give you His vision for your life. Proverbs 29:18 GWT says, 'Without prophetic vision people run wild, but blessed are those who follow [God's] teachings.' Look out! You don't want miss God's blessings and make a fool of yourself. Look up! Ask God to let you in on the bigger picture of your life. If you don't know where you're going, you'll miss it when you get there. Get in on God's action. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin...' Zechariah 4:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Does this sound familiar? <i>God, I'm trying to do the best thing all the time and stand up for what's right-like not picking on anyone and sticking up for them instead. Not that it seems to make any difference-people just question my motives. I'm trying to do what You say is right, but it all goes as flat as a punctured tyre. Jesus, I want to put my hope in You and soar on wings like eagles, but quite frankly I feel like I'm flapping like a finch!</i></p>
<p>Trying to make a difference can seem like more hassle than it's worth sometimes. But living by God's Word does make a difference: 'Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we cannot see.' (Hebrews 11:1 NLT) We all know someone who has trouble making friends (maybe that even applies to us) and we also know that even one person standing up for us really helps.</p>
<p>Who you follow, how you act and what you say can give God the room to change situations, circumstances and even lives. It can <b>feel</b> like you're making no difference, like you're flapping like a finch following Jesus-but keep at it and eventually you'll start to soar like an eagle. Eagles definitely have a better view!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.' 1 Peter 5:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'Cheer up, it might never happen!' can be the most annoying phrase in the whole world. And 'Turn that frown upside down!'<i> </i>can be as helpful as dropping your ice cream on the carpet. It can feel really patronising and unhelpful when people tell you not to worry. After all, most of the time you worry about things that actually matter. </p>
<p>One author wrote: 'A friend came up with this novel idea: &quot;Why don't you try this worry coupon? It entitles you to worry as much as you like, but only if it will: (a) feed and clothe you; (b) add to your life instead of taking from it; (c) make tomorrow better; (d) you don't mind acting like a non-believer! If that doesn't work make a list of all the things you're worrying about, place it in a box and put it up on a shelf where you can't see it. If God is either unwilling or unable to take care of it, you can always get the box and start worrying again but at least give Him a chance. While you are waiting for Him to answer, pray. Stand on His Word. Don't give your worries a voice.&quot;' </p>
<p>If you're a chronic worrier, why not make a list of the things you're worrying about, give them to God in prayer-and give Him a chance to help.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...With the heart one believes unto righteousness...' Romans 10:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.' (Romans 10:9-10 NLT) </p>
<p><i>Is that it?</i> Yes! Believing in your heart that Jesus died for you to make you right with God and confessing that out loud equals one glorious badge of salvation. Actually, it's better than a badge-we are made new! 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) </p>
<p><i>That sounds amazing but my life so far doesn't exactly look like one of Walt Disney's happily-ever-after stories. You don't know what I've done! I don't believe I could ever be righteous before God.</i> </p>
<p>That's why the Gospel is 'good news'! Jesus died for every sin imaginable! The Good News doesn't come with small print or exceptions. God's not like a Facebook user who accepts or declines friend requests! He accepts every time! 'One man, Jesus Christ, took on the sin of the world.' That includes yours! '...Neither the present nor the future...nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus...' (Romans 8:38-39 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now a certain man was sick...Lazarus of Bethany...' John 11:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Lazarus was a man Jesus raised from the dead. It's an amazing story of the miraculous. It's a great example of how Jesus proved He was the Son of God by giving life to Lazarus' dead limbs in the tomb with the words: 'Lazarus come out!' </p>
<p>But there's more we can learn from this story. We learn a lot about Jesus' character too. When Lazarus' sisters sent word to Jesus that their brother was sick, Jesus knew what God was doing: 'This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it.' (John 11:4-5 NIV) </p>
<p>Jesus knew from the beginning how it would end. Did Jesus rock up to Martha and Mary like a Las Vegas magician? 'Hey girls, had you going there, didn't I? Stop crying now and prepare to be amazed... Lazarus! Come on down!' </p>
<p>No, He did the opposite. When Jesus met with the sisters, He wept. He mourned with them. He loved them so He felt and understood what they were going through. The Bible says, 'Love must be sincere...rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.' (Romans 12:9;15 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now a certain man was sick...Lazarus of Bethany...' John 11:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Martha and Mary sent news to Jesus that their brother Lazarus was sick, and might die. What do you think Jesus did when He heard this? Well, you know Jesus loved people, so you might make an educated guess He went over to the house straight away. But no, He didn't. In fact, He waited two days before going to see them. And by that time Lazarus had died. </p>
<p><i>Funny way of showing you love someone, </i>you might think.<i> Doing nothing for a few days-what was Jesus thinking?</i> But God never makes mistakes. He always knows what He's doing and He did here, too. Jesus said to His disciples, '...Lazarus is dead, and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe...' (John 11:14-15 NIV)</p>
<p>Jesus wanted to instil into His disciples faith that He was who He said He was by letting them witness Lazarus come back to life. There was a purpose in His timing, not neglect. God loves us massively and because of that, no matter how bad things can be, we can trust that '...God works all things for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.' (Romans 8:28 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now a certain man was sick...Lazarus of Bethany...' John 11:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It must have been so difficult for Martha and Mary. They had to watch their brother die because Jesus didn't get to them in time. You wouldn't blame Martha and Mary if they felt a double dose of mourning: they'd lost their brother, and maybe they had lost hope in Jesus too. </p>
<p>But it didn't seem to rock Martha's faith! When Martha first saw Jesus after her brother had died she said to Him, 'Lord...if You had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now God will give You whatever You ask.' (John 11:21-22 NIV)</p>
<p>Martha not only believed Jesus would have saved Lazarus from sickness, she still believed He could save him 'even now' in death. Mary's initial reaction to Jesus' arrival in Bethany was very different to Martha's. Mary stayed at home whereas Martha was up and out of the house straight away to find Him. </p>
<p>Perhaps Mary stayed because she thought Jesus would be coming to the house anyway, so there wasn't any need. But there's a sense that Martha had so much hope in Jesus that she couldn't just wait for Him to just turn up, she had to seek Him out to declare the massive faith she had in Him. Martha was right to have that kind of hope in Jesus. He was who He said He was. He is the same for you! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give them an undivided heart...' Ezekiel 11:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>The rulers of Jerusalem had chosen to ignore God and turn away from Him by following the practices of other nations. By way of example, filling streets with dead bodies had become a regular pastime! Ezekiel was like a lifeguard being used as God's megaphone to speak to these people whom God had forced out of Israel because of their broken faith. </p>
<p>But through that time of judgment, God also gives words of hope to Ezekiel: '...I will give you back the land of Israel again. They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them.' (Ezekiel 11:17-18 NIV)</p>
<p>Jesus is the source of our hope. He took all the punishment for sin at the cross. But just like the people of Ezekiel's day who followed the practices of other nations, it's easy for our hearts to get divided. We need to focus on God rather than what our mates are doing or what society claims to be normal. </p>
<p>Have a fresh look at your heart for God. Would you say you're giving Him nothing but the best? Or does He get the leftovers of your life? The Bible says, 'Let us throw off everything that hinders us and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.' (Hebrews 12:1 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...First the blade, then the head, after that the full grain...' Mark 4:28 NKJ<br /><br /><p>At different times, all of us find ourselves waiting for God to make a move in our lives. If that's you right now, listen to the words of Jesus in the parable of the seed: </p>
<p>'The Kingdom of God is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, while he's asleep or awake, the seed sprouts and grows, but he does not understand how it happens. The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade pushes through, then the heads of wheat are formed, and finally the grain ripens.' (Mark 4:26-28 NLT)</p>
<p>Notice how things happen in stages. First, there's the 'I don't know' stage. Your seed is in the ground but when it will produce a harvest is entirely up to God. All you have is His Word to you promising that it will (and God never breaks a promise). Next comes 'the leaf blade' stage. It's just a tiny shoot blowing in the breeze but it's enough to encourage you and let you know that He is at work. Next comes 'the head' stage. Now it's starting to look like God-given God-driven transformation. Finally the 'full grain' appears. </p>
<p>The point is we don't always see what God's doing on the earth, or even under the earth, of our hearts. But He is busy working. The Kingdom is growing and will eventually appear.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus...' Romans 1:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>'Servant' is definitely a word that belongs in a history lesson! Here in the sunburnt land of Oz there are not many people today who'd admit to having servants. Those with a splash of cash might have a 'nanny' for the kids or a 'cleaner' for the house, but even the highest paid CEO probably doesn't call them 'servants'.</p>
<p>In Israel in Old Testament times, things were very different. There was a dignity to being a servant, especially if you were a 'bond-servant'. </p>
<p>In those times, servants were hired on the basis that they would work faithfully for their masters for six years. In the seventh year, the law said they had to be set free. But in many cases, the servants didn't want to go free. They had good lives; their wives and kids were happy; they loved their masters.</p>
<p>In that case, when it came time for a servant to be released, the master would take him before a judge and pierce his ear, signifying that he belonged to him forever. It was a sign the servant was committed to obeying him for life. It meant: 'Master, I'm not serving you because I have to but because I want to' (Exodus 21:6).</p>
<p>Is this your prayer today? <i>Lord, I'm not serving You because I have to but because I want to. Pierce my ear, mark me as Yours, bond me together with You so that I can never belong to another.</i></p>
<p>It's a very powerful thing to say-can you say it and mean it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.' Lamentations 3:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Book of Lamentations is not exactly the world's most exciting read. It doesn't get a big tick for adventure either. Yep, when it comes time to choose your next book to read <i>Lamentations</i> probably doesn't immediately spring to mind.</p>
<p>However when you do take the time to read it you find it is about hope, hope and still more hope. There are five poems in Lamentations and they describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the plight of those people living with the consequences of the nation's rebellion. However woven through these poems is the thread of belief in God's mercy and faithfulness: 'The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end.' (Lamentations 3:22 ESV) This is true whatever you've done! </p>
<p>The author, even through his affliction, recognises the benefit of his 'yoke'. The yoke represents the oppression of his sin. He was glad he had learned the lesson from rebellion, with many years left to live more wisely and with God. The poems take a real journey of painful loss and shame but end in restored hope and prayer for renewal.</p>

Psalm 144:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist writes: 'O Lord, what is man that You care for him?...Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.' (Psalm 144:3-4 NIV) As in, what's so great about us? We're here one minute, gone the next, why should God care? </p>
<p>God created us to have a relationship with Him, and He's planned amazing stuff for us all to do: we all have a purpose, a God-stamp of significance. </p>
<p>But people in our lives can make us doubt our worth: 'You're a waste of space!' 'You'll never amount to anything!' 'You'll never be good enough!' </p>
<p>If you hear these kinds of things enough, you can start to believe them. Sometimes we don't even need to hear them to start to believe them-it's just how we feel about ourselves. </p>
<p>Either way, what God says about us is very different: 'For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV) We are God's workmanship. We are beautiful in His sight because it is He who made us and knitted us together in our mother's womb. Far from worthless, we are His children and He has plans that will give us a hope and a future. </p>
<p>Read His Word. When you listen to God's words about you, you'll start to believe you are priceless, not worthless!</p>

(Colossians 3:12 NIV) If you love and admire Jesus, you should clothe yourselves and your attitudes in a way that leaves a lasting positive impression. </p>
<p>Being a Christian means we have been chosen to be God's ambassadors. This means we are His representatives to the people around us. We should wear love like a staple outfit, a must-have. </p>
<p>Loving in all circumstances takes knowing a loving God. There are times when loving can seem impossible. But we are not called to do this alone. 'Accept My teachings and learn from Me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit, and you will find rest for your lives. The teaching that I ask you to accept is easy; the load I give you to carry is light.' (Matthew 11:29-30 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Moses...became so tired...Aaron and Hur...stood on each side...holding up his hands...' Exodus 17:11-12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Israel was up against the Amalekites. Moses ordered Joshua to choose the fighters and then went to watch from the top of a hill, the staff of God in his hands. </p>
<p>Do you think anyone complained about Moses being lazy or scared? 'You lot go fight, I'll just stand here with a stick!' </p>
<p>No, because this staff wasn't a walking stick. It was God's staff-the one that had parted the Red Sea and drawn water out of a rock. </p>
<p>Having the staff of God in his hand showed the Israelites that (1) Moses was chosen to lead them (2) It was the Lord's power that would lead to victory, not Moses himself. As long as Moses held up the staff the Israelites were stronger in battle. But as his arms got tired and the staff dropped, the Amalekites gained advantage. </p>
<p>So, 'Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on. Then they stood on each side...holding up his hands.' There are times when we need friends like Aaron and Hur to join us on the hill overlooking our own battles. God didn't just lead Israel to victory that day. When Moses was at his weakest, He provided some helping hands. Are you trying to do it on your own when you could ask God for some helping hands?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Let's face it. Fear gets in the way sometimes. Sometimes fear can make your heart thump so hard you're sure people around you can hear it and are about to start bustin' dance moves around you.</p>
<p>Fear can completely control you, if you give in to it. But it is written: 'God has not given us a spirit of fear'! It's not from Him, it's not His desire, so we don't have to put up with it! God doesn't want us to fear and doesn't want us to worry. </p>
<p>You might say: '<i>Yeah, but everyone worries, don't they? Everyone gets a case of butterflies in the belly and wobble jelly legs at times. It's part of being human.' </i>But here's the deal: when you opened your heart to follow God, His Spirit (the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead) lives in you, and you are a new creation. God says we can conquer fear, worry and all other pesky anxieties, by choosing to give over all our worries and concerns to Him. In return, we can claim what He has given us: the spirit of power, love and a sound mind!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is Spirit, and His worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth.' John 4:24 NIV <br /><br /><p>If you watch those shopping channels, you'll hear the phrase 'body, soul and spirit' a lot. But this is actually our contemporary culture's reversal of the way the Bible sees us. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 tells us that we are spirit, soul and body (look it up!) Therefore, we're not simply bodies, occasionally having spiritual experiences, but are whole beings having <i>all</i> of these experiences. </p>
<p>The life force within you came from God. When we worship our Maker, it's like going back to our origins and reconnecting with our Maker. It's the very purpose of our existence-the thing we were created to do. </p>
<p>Let's consider some of the amazing things that happen in worship: (1) Our deepest thirst is quenched. (2) Our wounds are healed. (3) Our strength is renewed. (4) We're placed beyond the reach of our enemy. </p>
<p>King David was a worship leader whose songs have lasted thousands of years. You may not be able to download his latest album directly from iTunes but his worship material has connected people to God for centuries-his songs are called Psalms and you'll find them in every copy of the Bible. You don't need to go to a special worship event or buy the latest CD to worship God-our whole lives are about worshipping Him. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I must be about My Father's business.' Luke 2:49 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Choices, choices: sandals or sandshoes, burger or pizza, tweet or text? Life is full of choices. Ok, so the consequences of these choices might not be earth-shattering. But some choices we make every day shape who we become. Like whom we hang around with; like what we watch on TV; like how much effort we put into our coursework. </p>
<p>As a boy of twelve, Jesus knew His purpose and priorities, and He lived by them: 'I must be about My Father's business.' Do you know your priorities? A clear idea of what they are will shape your choices. We all make hundreds of choices each day, but the big question is: are those choices taking you nearer to your goal or further away? If you don't understand your life's goal, you won't be able to make the right choices.</p>
<p>The best way to make consistently good choices is to make prayer and God's Word your top priority. Ray Ortlund said: 'We must first be fully committed to Christ, then to one another in Christ, and finally to the work of Christ in the world.' The very fact you're reading this indicates you've got an interest in what God's got for you, so why not take this opportunity to ask Him afresh what His priorities for you are-and ask Him for His help to make any necessary changes? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.' Jeremiah 23:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Time travelling. Flying like a bird. Creating your very own solar system. These are three of the top ten dreams most unlikely to be fulfilled. How about yours? Most of us would love to wake up on a beach in Hawaii, but life doesn't often work like that. Do you need to wake up and smell the coffee? No doubt about it, a lottery mindset will lead you into trouble!</p>
<p>Consider the sad underbelly of reality TV: how many contestants go in for shows like <i>The X Factor</i> thinking they've 'got it', only to be told at the first hurdle that their act simply isn't good enough? Cue hissy fits, tantrums and general toys-out-of-pram behaviour. We wonder: how could they be so deluded? But maybe they're not the only ones who need a reality check.</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson observed: 'Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect.' When God gives you a dream, you need faith to make it materialise. But it's important to ask, 'Is my dream from God?' </p>
<p>David Westlake once said, 'God doesn't tell you to be great, He just asks you to do the next thing.' If you've got a big dream that you're hoping will turn into reality and not fade into fantasy, then God will give you the trustworthy test: if you can be trusted with the dull and the ordinary, maybe you can be trusted with the superstar stuff. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.' Jeremiah 23:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'Ask, and it will be given to you...' (Matthew 7:7 NKJ) 'Fantastic!' says your imagination. 'I'll have a Porsche 911, a big mansion, a pony in pink and a...' Whoa there, Nelly! Before you finish off your shopping list, check the small print! It has to be in line with God's will (1 John 5:14 NIV).</p>
<p>Joseph was a young bloke of seventeen with a richly ornamented robe (not necessarily Technicolour). He might have been a bit of a dreamer, but his dreams came true. Read the story for yourself in Genesis 37 if you don't think the musical does it justice. </p>
<p>The main points of his story were: God gave him some dreams indicating he'd be a big shot. Straight away, a heap of disappointment was dished out to him , followed by a dollop of false accusation, a slice of imprisonment and a helping of more dreams. The conclusion to the story is that his dreams actually did come true-<i>eventually</i>.</p>
<p>But they came true in a different way to what he expected. God worked his circumstances out so that he became humble and merciful, not arrogant and conceited. God cares more about good character than he does about gifting and talents. Rather than worrying about things out of your control in fantasyland, base what you do on your strengths and other factors within your control. When God gives you a dream, it will play to your strengths.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My soul thirsts for You...in a...land where there is no water.' Psalm 63:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>It's a hot summer's day. Your tongue is sticking to the roof of your mouth, you're virtually spitting feathers, so what do you do? Waltz to the kitchen, grab a glass, turn on the tap and hey presto: lovely cool drinking water. No big deal, is it? But hike up a hill on a hot summer's day without enough H2O and your body will soon let you know about it! It's a condition commonly known as 'thirst'.</p>
<p>David wrote about being thirsty in Psalm 63 when he was in the Desert of Judah. 'Earnestly I seek You, my soul thirsts for You, my body longs for You, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.' His enemies were pressing in on him and he cries out, 'Where are You, God?' </p>
<p>Ever been there? Wondering if God's taking a coffee break rather than answering your call? Just as physical thirst is your body's way of telling you that you need water, there's a spiritual thirst that only God can quench. And He will! 'You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart.' (Jeremiah 29:13 NIV) But you have to give God the time, space and the opportunity to do so. Half-hearted efforts won't cut it. Don't dehydrate, drink from the fountain of life!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you have to endure...trials...' 1 Peter 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>The film <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i> tells the true story of Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith. Having invested the family's hard-earned savings into portable bone-density scanners, he begins a career as a salesman. Having little understanding of business, the whole venture goes pear-shaped and ruins the family financially. As a result his wife leaves him.</p>
<p>Things pick up for Chris when he gains an internship after a chance meeting with a stockbroker and some fancy moves with a Rubik's cube. However, he's dealt another blow when he and his young son are evicted from their home for unpaid taxes. He's now homeless with a demanding, low-paid job and a young son to care for. </p>
<p>Left with no other option but to stay in a homeless shelter that he must queue up for each day (because of the demand for limited rooms), he works as hard as he can to stay afloat, and keep his job. He pushes on to develop ways of making phone sales more efficient and remains faithful in caring for his son despite the pressure. Finally he is rewarded by a fully paid position. By the time the credits roll, we discover that Chris went on to form his own multi-million dollar brokerage firm. </p>
<p>There's a lesson here for us. When things get tough, keep on keeping on and don't give up! As Peter said: 'There is wonderful joy ahead!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>Yesterday, we looked at one man's trials and his story of overcoming difficulty and we're going to continue to look at the idea of overcoming or conquering in the next few days. But what does it mean? Well, another shorter word is: 'winning'! </p>
<p>Facing difficulties is simply proving true what Jesus said: '...Here on earth, you will have many trials...' (John 16:33 NLT) Don't be duped into thinking that because you're a Christian, you are now immune to problems. That's simply not true. The storms of life blew against the houses of both the wise and the foolish man. The difference was that the wise man not only heard Jesus' words but put them into practice, and his house stood strong against the storm. Read it for yourself in Matthew 7:24-27. </p>
<p>So what's God's goal? To make you an overcomer, not an escape artist! God's more than able to deliver you, but He's really interested in <i>developing</i> you. But do you sometimes sit there wishing for everything you haven't been given? </p>
<p>God doesn't make mistakes. He's given you all you need to be you. Remember: '...People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NLT) Adopt God's standard, not society's.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>Siblings! One minute you're laughing and joking, the next they're ripping your hair out. For a while you make up and everything's fine, but then they take it one step too far and suddenly blurt out the most unkind, hurtful, painful thing you've ever heard: '...You'll get no inheritance...you're the son of that other woman.' (Judges 11:2 GWT) Whoa!</p>
<p>This was exactly how it was for Jephthah. And what they'd said was true. He was the son of a prostitute. So they kicked him out of the family home, robbed him of his rightful inheritance only to come crawling back to him years later, asking for his help when they were in trouble. The nerve of them! But he didn't tell them to take a running jump. Instead, he swallowed his pride, trained up an army, defeated Israel's enemies and even gets a mention in the Faith Hall of Fame found in Hebrews 11, rubbing shoulders with Samson and David! </p>
<p>But how did he do it? Well, he didn't let his past define his future. He overcame the hurt inflicted by those who were supposed to love him and seized his chance to make a difference. You are more than the product of your environment. Leave yesterday where it belongs-in the past. 'This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!' (2 Corinthians. 5:17 NLT) Live in the new and say goodbye to the old. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>Have you been hoping and praying for a friend of yours to become a Christian? Invited them to church but they've informed you they're washing their hair instead? Tried to be a good witness and crowbar God in to conversation at every available opportunity, but still not even a jot of interest? </p>
<p>You're not alone if you're feeling the pangs of disappointment: Isaac's son Esau rejected God even though his other son Jacob surrendered to God. The prophet Samuel's sons were out for what they could get for themselves, accepting bribes and perverting justice. In fact, history is full of people sadly rejecting God's salvation plan. We can end up discouraged if we take the matter to heart too much. </p>
<p>So, before we get too down about it all, let's consider three important lessons about salvation. (1) God alone can save. As Jonah sat in the intestine of a large fish contemplating his own actions, he had revelation of this truth: 'Salvation comes from the Lord.' (Jonah 2:9 NIV) Don't take on guilt that isn't yours. Because God is so great, He knows exactly how and when to close the deal for your mates. (2) 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done.' (Philippians 4:6 NLT) Your part is to pray and believe God for your mate's salvation, then hand over the burden to God. (3) If they're alive, there's hope! God is bigger than stubborn hearts and people's circumstances, if only you will trust Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love...endures through every circumstance.' 1 Corinthians 13:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you ever been to an amazing conference or festival like Easterfest, Strawberry Jam or Hillsong? Was the worship tingle-inducing? Did you have an encounter with God that changed your life? Hear teaching that blew your mind? But now you look round your own church and see Aunt Ethel in the same pew as always, Bob the organist slowly decaying and a minister who just doesn't get you. Then it hits you: <i>I'll do church my way. After all, there's teaching on the internet and I'll listen to some proper worship music! I'll see you losers later!</i></p>
<p>But that's not what God wants. The church is God's plan for you. There is no plan B. The old cliché rings true: 'If you find the perfect church, don't join it, you'll only spoil it.' Instead of asking what church can do for you, ask what you can do for your church. How about having a chat with Aunt Ethel-she might surprise you. And as for Bob the organist, why not see if you can help on the worship team? If you're really not happy, talk it through with your youth leader or someone you trust. Whinging with your mates isn't the way. </p>
<p>Leaving a church isn't to be taken lightly. A tree that keeps getting uprooted can't keep growing, it just slowly dies. We all need feeding and watering, and that will happen through your church. Get involved and ask God for more of Him, so that you can endure 'through every circumstance.' (1 Corinthians 13:7 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Meditate on it day and night...' Joshua 1:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>'A ruminant is a mammal that digests plant-based food by initially softening it within the animal's first stomach, then regurgitating the semi-digested mass and chewing it again. This is called &quot;ruminating&quot;'. Thanks, Wikipedia! </p>
<p>If you're wondering why we're talking about a rather unpleasant way of reviewing your lunch today, it's all to do with ruminating-or meditating. </p>
<p>If we want to live spiritually healthy lives, it's important that we eat right. That means healthy portions of God's Word. Yet some bits of the Bible need to be chewed rather than swallowed whole. Otherwise we suffer the spiritual equivalent of heartburn and indigestion. No matter how busy life gets, we need to make sure we're making time to process, chew and meditate on God's Word so that it can take root and become part of you. </p>
<p>When Joshua replaced Moses as leader of the Israelites, God told him three times to 'Be strong and very courageous.' (Joshua 1:7 NIV) It would seem God was trying to make a point. He went on to explain where that strength and courage would come from: 'Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.' (Joshua 1:8 NIV)</p>
<p>God is saying that if we take His Word to our very core, then we have a role to play in our strength and success. You wouldn't swallow a piece of steak like you would a spoonful of yoghurt. Chew on it, and keep chewing.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom...' Isaiah 11:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>During His earthly ministry, Jesus needed the Spirit of wisdom to make all sorts of decisions. He even rebuked one of His own disciples, Peter, for getting in the way of God: 'Go away from Me, Satan! You don't care about the things of God, but only about things people think are important.' (Mark 8:33 NCV)</p>
<p>As followers of Jesus, that same Spirit lives in us. James points out three kinds of ungodly wisdom in James 3:15 (look it up). Firstly, earthly wisdom: this isn't always dependable because 'sometimes what seems right is really a road to death.' (Proverbs 16:25 CEV) Secondly, sensual wisdom: based on emotions which can be confusing and lead to hurt and jealousy. Thirdly, demonic wisdom which is selfish and ungodly. </p>
<p>But Godly wisdom is altogether different and is 'first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.' (James 3:17 NIV) A few things to consider, then: Are your motives pure or would you be embarrassed when a bit more light is shed on the matter? Are you willing to submit to what God wants, even if it's something you desperately want? Is your conscience clear if you go ahead, or does it require deception and selfishness? Is it fair and impartial or is it favouring a particular group or person? </p>
<p>James says, '...if you want to know what God wants you to do-ask Him, and He will gladly tell you. He will not resent your asking.' (James 1:5 NLT)</p>

John 5:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>The relationship Jesus had with His Father is the kind of relationship that He wants you to have with Him. Jesus modelled it perfectly, and today we'll consider one aspect of that relationship: <i>intimacy</i>. Some people might go all red at the mention of the word-but actually it just means 'closeness'. </p>
<p>Jesus said, 'The Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He is doing...' (John 5:20 NLT) Now I might be able to reel off a few facts about Prince William, but I don't really know how he thinks, what makes him tick, what disappoints him. It's the same with our relationship with God. How close are you to God right now? Do you have a quick flick through <i>word4U2day</i> and then it's straight on with your own agenda? Are you close enough to know when you've said or done something that saddens God? Are you close enough to feel the warmth of His presence? 'Come near to God and God will come near to you' (James 4:8 NIV) never fails to be true. The truth is that you are as close to God as you desire to be, decide to be, and discipline yourself to be. So ask yourself, what are you desiring? God's Word or whatever's on TV? God's house or your mate's house? God's will or your own will? God is a gentleman-He won't force Himself on anyone, and He'll only come as close as you let Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I carry out the will of the One who sent Me, not My own will.' John 5:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>Three things characterised Christ's relationship with His Father. Yesterday we looked at <i>intimacy</i> and today we'll look at His <i>dependency</i> on God. 'I tell you the truth: the Son can do nothing on His own; He does only what He sees His Father doing. What the Father does, the Son also does.' (John 5:19 GNT) Someone once said, 'Christians don't tell lies, they just sing them.' It can be easy to declare our dependence on God in the middle of amazing worship. But then walk out the door with the same prideful heart, totally unchanged. Often, if we fail at something, it's because we collapsed under the weight of a task God never gave us in the first place. </p>
<p>Are you struggling with insecurity or fear? Don't! Instead take strength from God's Word... 'For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.' (Isaiah 41:13 NIV) Your Heavenly Father won't ever give you something to do that won't require His wisdom and strength. It'll be designed to increase your dependence on Him, not decrease it. When you wake up each day, let your first thought be: 'God, I need You today, and there is no backup plan!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I carry out the will of the One who sent Me, not My own will.' John 5:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>The third aspect of the relationship between Christ and the Father is <i>obedience</i>. Before you flick the page, assuming this is going to be a bit heavy, hang on two ticks! First, remember that God is love and that it's because of His awesome love for each one of us that He wants our best. God's not trying to cramp your style, He's looking to protect you. When you make Jesus Lord, you give up three basic rights your ego may have an issue with: (1) <i>What it will cost you</i>. It cost Jesus everything, namely His life. (2) <i>Where it will take you</i>. Jesus came from the beauty of Heaven to the rags of this world for us. (3) <i>The amount which it will change you</i>. Jesus went through separation from His Father to take on our sin on the cross. </p>
<p>Jesus said, 'I judge only as I hear, and My judgment is just, for I seek not to please Myself but Him who sent Me.' (John 5:30 NIV) Notice the bit that says, 'as I hear'. When you've heard from God, you've heard from God. End of story. It's time to get with the programme-God's programme! Don't go seeking after security, seek after God. 'In all your ways submit to Him and He will make your paths straight.' (Proverbs 3:6 NIV) Obedience is a sadly underrated virtue in our self-seeking culture. But when you walk in obedience, God's best is what you'll get. Don't settle for anything less. </p>

<alias><![CDATA[gods-grace]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If by grace, then it is no longer by works...' Romans 11:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>For all you theatre lovers out there, we're going to connect today's verse to '<i>Les Mis'</i>. Hit musical <i>Les Miserables</i> tells the story of convict Jean Valjean, a lead character who finds himself offered mercy by a kind bishop. One night, while the house sleeps, Jean Valjean helps himself to the family silver and shoots through. </p>
<p>The next morning three policemen knock on the bishop's door with Valjean in tow. They're all for throwing him in jail. But the bishop says: 'So there you are! I'm delighted to see you. Had you forgotten I gave you the candlesticks as well? They're silver like the rest, and worth 2000 francs. Did you forget to take them?' The bishop not only gets the criminal off the hook, he sets him up for life, challenging him to use the money to become an honest man. And amidst the singing and dancing (and that special song Susan Boyle made her own) a near-perfect picture of 'grace' is drawn. </p>
<p>Do you see it? We are like Jean Valjean and God is like the bishop. Not only does God forgive our sins He also gives us the family silver. He wipes our slate clean with the challenge to go and make something of ourselves. And it's not something we can earn or buy; it's a gift called 'grace'. Praise God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord God called to the man, &quot;Where are you?&quot;' Genesis 3:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>It was the morning after. Adam's head throbbed. The place was a mess. His stomach felt like it was hurtling down a rollercoaster. Little fragments of what happened last night kept coming back to him. Did I really spend so long chatting about that snake? And why have I woken up with a half-eaten piece of fruit in my bed? </p>
<p>He remembered the blazing row with Eve. (Quarrelling-that was something new to Eden.) What exactly <i>did</i> happen last night? He felt strangely vulnerable. Naked, in fact. Best not let God find out, he thought. Just then the sound of feet rustled through the morning leaves. 'Adam, where are you?' called God. Adam had an idea: hide! </p>
<p>And it seems that ever since, people keep trying to hide. And God keeps asking, 'Where are you?' Maybe you're hiding beneath good grades at school and trophies and awards. You're telling the world, 'I am capable, honest.' Maybe you're hiding behind a long string of relationships; you're telling everyone, 'I am wanted, honest.' Maybe you're hiding beneath a scowl and warning the world, 'Don't mess with me or else.' </p>
<p>Of course God knew all along where to find Adam; He wanted Adam to find himself. Until you do that, you're truly lost. Unless you admit there's a problem, it can't be fixed. You can't be fixed. Stop hiding and ask that person in the mirror honestly, 'Where are you?' Face the naked truth.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...it may be that the Lord will work for us...' 1 Samuel 14:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jonathan, King Saul's son, crept into enemy territory till he was right in the barracks, face to face with a swarm of armed soldiers. 'Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't such a good idea after all,' he should have thought. Maybe he should've waited until he got the go-ahead from the intelligence guys back home. Maybe he should've brought more back-up. Maybe he should've waited until all the stars lined up in the sky spelling: 'Attack now, Johnny Boy!' Maybe. </p>
<p>But Jonathan had more faith than that. His belief was proactive. His confidence in God was the dangerous type. '...It may be that the Lord will work for us' was his attitude. And his certainty in God started off a chain reaction in the Philistines' camp that led to victory for Israel. </p>
<p>The point of the story isn't that God rewards mavericks who go off and do their own thing. It's more a lesson in finding out what pleases God, then doing it. If you wait for perfect conditions you'll never achieve anything. </p>
<p>A lot of impressive God-go-getters haven't necessarily received clear instructions in how to change the world. They merely act on a hunch of what they believe pleases God. So you haven't specifically heard God ask you to volunteer for the coffee roster...but maybe He'd be pleased if you did. Here's the thing; you're going to face a lot more of 'maybe' than 'definitely' in life. But your faith won't grow unless you act and give God the opportunity to turn your 'maybe' into a 'definitely'. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...it may be that the Lord will work for us...' 1 Samuel 14:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Go over yesterday's story again. The problem with this story is we can use it to justify what we want, in the hope that God will bless our 'maybe' with a 'definitely'. Jonathan wasn't on some killing spree for the sake of it. He had a strong understanding of God's justice. </p>
<p>The Philistines were violently opposed to God's people. They enslaved Jewish men and violated Jewish women. Remember Goliath? He was a mouthpiece for the Philistines-he publicly rained down curses on God. In short, Jonathan wasn't making trouble-he was seizing a chance for justice. Rule one for chancing a 'maybe' with God: <i>make sure your motives are just</i>. </p>
<p>Jonathan wasn't some opportunist who knew nothing about God. Reading our Bibles we get a picture of an upright man who cared deeply about God being glorified. He was a man of faith. Rule two: <i>Unless you have a proven track record of stepping out in faith make sure you're getting sound advice before placing all bets on a 'maybe'</i>. </p>
<p>The Bible warns of people who want something to happen, and presume God does too. Jonathan's father King Saul is led to his own downfall because he expected God to rubberstamp his own agenda. The difference with Jonathan was that his heart was right before God. Rule three: <i>To turn your 'maybe' into a miracle takes wisdom and a desire to see God's will be done</i>. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let patience have its perfect work...' James 1:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Mike Pilavachi once wisely compared answered prayer to a tortoise. Think about it, a tortoise dawdles at an incredibly slooooow pace. Occasionally the answers to our prayers can seem a long time coming. We send one up to God and it's as if He straps the answer to the shell of a tortoise. The trouble is, often we give up waiting and so the tortoise, having only made it half way to us, turns round and heads back home. </p>
<p>Our culture hates waiting. We've got steam blowing out of our ears if we have to wait ten minutes in a queue. We get twitchy fingers waiting for our computers to boot up. And heaven help the fast food chain that keeps us waiting five minutes on our quarter pounder. We carry our twitching fingers and steaming ears into our prayer life. </p>
<p>But God just isn't in the same rush as us when it comes to relationship. '...if we look forward to something we don't have yet, we must wait patiently and confidently. And the Holy Spirit helps us in our distress.' (Romans 8:25-26 NLT) </p>
<p>Perhaps God sometimes keeps us waiting because He wants us to be more thankful for the giver than the gift. You wouldn't give up on your mum just because she won't give you your Christmas present in August; nor should we give up on God just because He hasn't given us an answer out of season. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Glancing this way and that and seeing no one...' Exodus 2:12 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>Nice work, Moses. The guy was asking for it, exploiting the poor like that, striking the other bloke like a dumb animal. Slavery is evil. Who wouldn't have brought down a large boulder on his skull? One question though: if what you did was right, Moses, why are you trying to cover it up? Why are you dragging a corpse down around the back of the pyramids? Why are you looking to hide the bloodstained body? </i></p>
<p>Ever done something wrong when nobody was watching? Late-night channel hopping and you land on planet porn? Downloading that album not yet out in the shops? Sneaking into your mum's purse? <i>Nice work. Got away with that one. Nobody has seen me.</i> Except God, of course. God sees everything. When we know we can get away with it, but we still choose not give in to temptation, God smiles. </p>
<p>But what if the pull is too strong? After all we're only human. That's when we need to get some accountability. Be answerable to someone wise and trustworthy. Let them know your struggles and ask them to support you. Avoid situations that are likely to lure you. Set a curfew on your viewing habits. Allow your accountability partner access to your smartphone. Remember, 'the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience...' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Each family had just what it needed.' Exodus 16:18 NLT <br /><br /><p>Each day brought the same worry, the same temptation: <i>What if God doesn't provide tomorrow? What if we wake up in the morning and there isn't a dish of manna in sight? Isn't it best we store a little away tonight just in case tomorrow the cupboard is bare?</i> Whenever the Israelites disobeyed the commandment from God and hoarded the stuff, then maggots turned up, rats nibbled at it or the manna just turned a bit green and furry. God provided enough for one day at a time: 'Everyone had just enough. Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered...a little had enough. Each family had just what it needed.' </p>
<p>Are you stuck out in your own wilderness? Do you worry that God might not turn up tomorrow? Are you tempted to solve your own problems, completely bypassing God in the process? Stay strong. When you're going through a 'just enough' season God is teaching you to trust Him on a daily basis. Yeah sure, sometimes it can seem like an hourly basis. He's allowing you to taste this verse for real: '...His mercies...are new every morning...' (Lamentations 3:22-23 NCV) </p>
<p>God never lets us gather tomorrow's manna today. Philippians 4:19 NKJ says He will 'supply all your need according to His riches in glory.' God wants you to rely on the Giver not the gift, to trust Him with your needs, and to learn that He always brings good out of bad situations.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['And He...said, &quot;Behold, I make all things new...&quot;' Revelation 21:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You probably have a mate who bought a bomb of a car and was full of talk about how he was going to do it up and turn it into a 'show car'. But at the end of the day his lack of skill, combined with no planning and very little cash, meant that all he achieved was a more expensive old bomb of a car. He expected too much return for too little investment (and he probably never listened to the experts). Well, maybe there are warning signs there for us as we look at renovating our lives. </p>
<p>First, <i>do we expect too much when investing very little?</i> John Wesley said, 'God does nothing but by prayer, and everything with it.' We know that God works through prayer. We read or hear testimonies of people changed by the power of prayer. All of Jesus' significant moments are prepped in prayer: before He picked His disciples, He was up all night in prayer; He walked on water following a quiet prayer time; before the cross, He sweated blood through prayer. It's clear-we can't expect a great change in our lives without first investing in time alone with God. </p>
<p>Secondly, <i>do we listen to the expert?</i> Prayer can easily become a one way dialogue. We want God to bless our agenda, our shopping list. But prayer should be the moment we lock into God's will. We need to make time to listen to Him through reading our Bible and expecting to hear His voice. 'The Lord is close to all who call on Him, yes, to all who call on Him sincerely.' (Psalm 145:18 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['And He...said, &quot;Behold, I make all things new...&quot;' Revelation 21:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>A classic mistake of the wannabe property developers we see on the TV 'reality' shows is they forget the original purpose of the project: to make money. </p>
<p>Half the budget will go on a set of Edwardian taps because one of the team simply adores the way they curve like a swan's neck. The experts will remind them that this expense will be subtracted from the profit. But by now they're more interested in period plumbing! </p>
<p>What can we learn from this when renovating our own lives? Purpose. Ephesians 1:11 NLT reminds us, '...because of Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us from the beginning, and all things happen just as He decided long ago.' </p>
<p>It's all too easy to veer off-project and forget your original purpose. You weren't placed on this earth to get a good job or make money or become famous. You are on assignment here on this earth-your purpose, to glorify God and reflect His beauty through your relationship with Him. Everything else merely subtracts from your profit. Don't blow your budget on secondary stuff, stockpile treasure in Heaven instead. Remind yourself today, <i>I'm here on this earth to know God and make Him known. My purpose finds meaning through God. </i></p>

<p>The best part of any TV home renovation show is saved until the end of the programme. Through the marvel of editing, the director switches from one shot of a run-down, dilapidated dump to the next shot of a sparkling first-time buyer's dream home, complete with new kitchen, sanded floorboards and magnolia walls. The transformation is evident. The house viewers are oblivious to the trials and tantrums and breakdowns the team sweated through to renovate their pile of bricks.</p>
<p>Christian biographies can sometimes use the director's clever editing trick too. We read stories of these heroes of faith who have conquered the world for Christ in their lunch hour. And we look at the pile of bricks of our lives and feel disheartened.</p>
<p>Well, books condense a lifetime of God's work in someone's life to dozen chapters or so. Fact is, four chapters of Billy Graham cutting his toenails or Corrie ten Boom paying the electricity bill doesn't sell books. Heroes of faith have to plod through the mundane moments and discouragements of everyday living as much as we do. They're as faithful in the small things as the public things. So you didn't raise the dead in your coffee break? But did you dare pray for your mate's headache? Honour God in the smaller things and He'll take you one step at a time to the bigger things. He'll turn your pile of bricks into something really impressive.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For the Lord gives wisdom...' Proverbs 2:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Just visit any bookshop and you'll see shelves and shelves of paperbacks all promising the secret to success or the promise of a happy life. The 'Business' section promises the key to mega-wealth. 'Mind, Body and Spirit' promises the road to spiritual bliss. 'Biography' promises the hush-hush secrets to triumphant living. </p>
<p>Jesus warned us not to be gullible: '...the road is wide that leads to hell, and many people enter through that gate. But the...road is narrow that leads to true life. Only a few people find that road. Be careful of false prophets. They come to you looking gentle like sheep, but they are really dangerous like wolves.' (Matthew 7:13-15 NCV) </p>
<p>Fulfilment Jesus-style is measured in service. Over and over He said not to push yourself to the top, but instead help others there. 'Whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest...' (Matthew 20:26 NCV) </p>
<p>If you want to be a success, Jesus suggested, you're going to need more help than your own brain power and muscle: 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from Heaven.' (John 3:27 ESV) This is why prayer is a must for any wannabe success story. Prayer sketches up God's drafts for your life. Without it you're basing your living on guesswork and flukes. </p>
<p>Finally, keep your eyes open for the 'wise ones' God has placed in your path. Success heeds the advice of others: 'Plans fail without good advice, but they succeed with the advice of many others.' (Proverbs 15:22 NCV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This job is too heavy...to handle...by yourself.' Exodus 18:18 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's gifted and talented, then there's Michelangelo. The ultimate Renaissance man, this guy excelled as a painter, sculptor, and architect. Jon Walker writes: 'Imagine if God created you to be the Michelangelo of this age but you stayed so busy doing all kinds of things-good things-that you never got around to painting and sculpting. You'd end up missing the best because you got distracted chasing the good. What a disappointment...for God...and all the people who would have been blessed if you'd stayed focused on your original purpose.' Likewise, imagine if Michelangelo never got round to painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel because he was too busy undercoating the walls of his neighbour's spare room. This isn't meant to put down generous acts (God is the proud sponsor of generosity), it's a wake-up call to staying on task with whatever God has predestined you to do. </p>
<p>The world is jam-packed with 'needs' and 'needy people' but God doesn't expect you to be the solution to every need. Moses learned the same lesson, when he spent every waking moment dealing with complaints from long lines of people. His father-in-law said, 'You're going to wear yourself out-and the people, too,' and advised him to appoint capable leaders to 'help...carry the load.' (Exodus 18:18;22 NLT) It was a win-win solution-the people got help faster, and Moses became a better leader. Release the load God never meant you to carry, and focus on what He called you to do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...sexual sin, perversion of any kind, or greed...is not appropriate behaviour for God's holy people.' Ephesians 5:3 GWT<br /><br /><p>It's hard going, this Christian commitment thing. It seems the whole world is pairing off while you're left alone with a bunch of rules for company: 'No sex outside marriage. No dating non-believers. No tempting others. No fantasising. No visiting porn websites.' </p>
<p>First, despite popular belief (or unbelief if you like) God is <i>for</i> sex. He invented it. He planned it out so intimacy feels good. Good idea, God, nice one. However, God understands (far more than we do) that relationships need to be built upon things with a little more substance than mere flesh on flesh.</p>
<p>Trust, unswerving love, commitment, compatibility, romance and sex all need the parameters of a long-term relationship such as marriage. Without it, we cheapen ourselves and each other. Secondly, if God really does mean the world to you, why would you want to spend all your time with someone who won't even acknowledge Him? The rule for not dating non-believers is to protect you. Sooner or later your loyalty to God or your beloved will be stretched. Who needs that brain-stretch right? So don't sell yourself short, wait and enjoy God's best-it's worth it! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.' Romans 10:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Now be honest, how many times do you actually read the day's verse that accompanies the reading. I mean <i>really</i> read it? Not just catch a quick glance as you dig into the larger paragraph for a bit of direction. This isn't some kind of Christian horoscope you know-the idea is to be inspired to crack open your Bible.</p>
<p><i>word4U2day</i> isn't God-breathed-only Scripture is. So, use this little booklet to awaken your taste buds to the real thing. In fact, why not start memorising some of the verses each day?</p>
<p>Here's how: choose a time when you're free from distraction. Read the verse again and again. Say it out loud because hearing your own voice will help cement it. Go away and come back to it. Try repeating it when you're waiting for a bus or going for a jog or in the shower. Write it down over and over again. Test yourself on it the next day.</p>
<p>Being proactive with God's Word will pay dividends. When you need direction the Holy Spirit will be able to bring it to mind. When someone asks for your help the answer they need might pop up in a verse. When you're tempted to stray the right verse may reframe your thinking. Jesus promised that whoever hears His words and puts them into action will stand strong when times of trouble come (learn it in Luke 6:46-49).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have faith in God that it will happen just as He told me.' Acts 27:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>It seemed like a monster was eating the ship. A violent wind pulled at the sails, lightning sizzled the mast, twenty metre high waves kept dunking the boat's bow in and out of the water. The sea thrashed across the deck, spilling men into its hungry belly. The sailors were sure they were never going to reach Rome alive. And it all could've been avoided. </p>
<p>Paul wasn't one for saying, 'I told you so.' He'd already warned them, 'Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss.' (Acts 27:9 NIV) But the majority had sided with the captain and so they set sail. </p>
<p>Lesson one: Listening to the majority doesn't make you right. Sometimes listening to God may go against human logic. Lesson two: God always brings good out of our mistakes. Despite Paul's warning, they ended up shipwrecked in Malta. Instead of arguing about who was to blame, Paul channelled his energy into spreading the Gospel. </p>
<p>When we slip up, rather than play the blame game, we'd do well to see what God is up to through our mistakes. Lesson three: Whatever we've lost, God can find again. All of Paul's belongings are forever lost at sea (or in the belly of some octopus) and yet Acts 28:10 tells us the people of Malta finally sent Paul away loaded with supplies. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who will go for us?' Isaiah 6:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sitting in his office scribbling down notes for a meeting, a man looks up from his desk and glances out the window. A king whose face burns like fire appears, seated on a throne of clouds. Isaiah takes off his glasses, gives them a wipe and wonders if he's got a fever. He sees the king's robes trail down from the sky and flow into a church. He rubs his eyes and peeks out between his fingers. Angels are darting across the roof, sparkling like rainbow-coloured fireworks. A voice booms: 'Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?' </p>
<p>Isaiah tears himself from his desk and steps towards the light. 'Here I am. Send me.' </p>
<p>Isaiah chapter 6 records the details of Isaiah's full cinematic spiritual experience: visions, voices and warm glowy feelings. But he knew he couldn't stay wrapped up in the moment. Soon after saying, 'Here I am. Send me,' the prophet took his experience and went into the world outside with his message. He faced opposition, hard hearts and faith-testing times but still Isaiah had to go. What about you? So the fuzzy feelings of summer conferences have gone. You remember touching God's heart so close only a month ago. But where are your godly goosebumps now, eh? </p>
<p>Well, like Isaiah, now is the time to leave the cinematic stuff and step out into the hurting world with God's message. Whom shall He send? You? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm.' James 1:6 CEV<br /><br /><p>From the top of the hill the hard-talking warrior could be seen by all. His dry, rasping voice carried through the valley, bouncing off stones straight into the hearts of men, women and children. Some of these men had lost brothers, some of the women had given sons to bloodthirsty wars. But nobody had quite showed the bravery of Joshua. Like a lion protecting its cubs he'd fought for the future of his people. And they'd all reached the moment when they had to decide which way they were heading. </p>
<p>He urged them to ditch their useless wooden idols and godless bits of superstitious metal on the other side of the river. 'Stop running hot, then cold. Worship the living God or put your faith in superstition-but don't insult the Heavens by trying to do both. As for me and my family, we will worship God,' Joshua concludes. The crowds growl in agreement.</p>
<p>Do you have one foot in God's side of the fence and another in your own backyard? Chances are you feel down more than up. You feel frustrated at your lot in life. You go round in circles chasing your tail. Your life stops and starts. Unless you choose to follow God wholeheartedly like Joshua you're going to experience life like a wave tossed around in a storm. Don't be full of religious sales talk-live like you believe God is God. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm.' James 1:6 CEV<br /><br /><p>James chews on the end of his pen. His mind tries its hardest to reach for the perfect image. He needs to find a way of describing a problem with these early Christians. He scratches his beard and mutters to himself, 'What good is a truth if they don't know how to live it? What good is an intention if they can't follow it through?' </p>
<p>The trouble is they have the right words, they know all the jargon, they've passed the theory but they keep flunking the practical. They say one thing and then do the other. They're as consistent as ocean waves in a storm, hurling themselves one way, raging themselves the other. 'Wait! That's it!' He scribbles: '...a doubtful mind is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.' (James 1:6 NLT) </p>
<p>Lots of us are up and down like wind-whipped waves, furiously trying to do things our way, trying to have the casting vote. But didn't Jesus teach us to pray, '<i>Your</i> will be done'? Shouldn't God have the controls, not us? Grasping and holding tight to things makes us look like toddlers pulling tantrums. The mature believer recognises that 'if you try to keep your life for yourself, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for [Jesus], you will find true life.' (Matthew 16:25 NLT) So stop behaving like a wave blown about on the ocean and start trusting God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened...as...warnings for us.' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Contrary to popular belief it wasn't Celine Dion's <i>My Heart Will Go On</i> that sank the <i>Titanic</i>. The 270m ocean liner went down in 1912 on its first voyage from England to New York, sunk by an iceberg. Recently, scientists used sound waves to probe through the wreckage, which is buried in mud four kilometres underwater. Here's what they were surprised to discover: the damage was surprisingly small. Instead of a huge gash, they found six relatively narrow slits across the six watertight holds. 'Everything that could go wrong, did,' said William Garzke Jr, a naval architect who helped the team with their analysis. </p>
<p>So, what sank the <i>Titanic</i>? Four things-things that could sink you too! First, they thought they were immune, that it couldn't happen to them. Secondly, they were 'asleep at the wheel' and failed to heed five different warnings. Thirdly, it wasn't one big thing, but a series of small things that took them under. Finally, the problem that finally destroyed them was hidden beneath the waterline, out of sight. The Bible says, 'These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us... So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!' (1 Corinthians 10:11-12 NIV) Not one of us, however strong, wise, successful or good, is immune to failure. Staying close to God will help make sure the iceberg of a mistake won't sink you.</p>

<p>The parable of the prodigal son is a stark reminder that actually we don't always know best. '...a man had two sons. The younger one said...Father, give me my share... Not long after...[he]...set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine...and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out...to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.' (Luke HYPERLINK  &quot;http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Luke 15.11-16&quot;15:11-16 NIV) When God says 'no', He has a very good reason. When He pulls back on your reins, listen. It's better to be alone and walk with God than be surrounded by people but away from God. If you are waiting for things to improve start doing things God's way! Are you willing to repent and come back home? In three back-to-back parables in Luke 15, Jesus points out that the shepherd went looking for his lost sheep, the woman went looking for her lost silver, but nobody went looking for the lost son. That's because he knew the way back. And it happened when 'he came to his senses'. The rebel who left dad saying, 'Give me,' humbled himself and came back saying, 'Forgive me.' When he did, his dad embraced him and said, 'This son of mine was...lost and is found...' (Luke 15:24 NIV) Your Heavenly Father is waiting to welcome you home too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow labourer.' Philemon 1:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Paul called Philemon 'our beloved friend and fellow labourer.' Obviously Paul had found a guy with the right stuff. How do you become 'the right stuff'? </p>
<p>First, have the right frame of mind. Life has a funny habit of throwing mud against your window to see what sticks. Well, refuse to become a prisoner of circumstances. You can't control what happens to you but you can control how you react. 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all he has done. If you do this, you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand.' (Philippians 4:6-7 NLT) Secondly, accept forgiveness. Don't let past failures haunt you. Don't rummage around your old sin-bin looking for excuses for failure. Admit them. Learn from them. And move on. 'Your sins have been forgiven because of Jesus.' (1 John 2:12 NLT) </p>
<p>Thirdly, be grateful. The day is too short to waste hours of it in self-pity, worry or boredom. This is the day that the Lord has made. Enjoy it like a child, use it to break records and write history. When tomorrow comes, today will be gone forever. So while it's still alive use it for loving, living and giving to God. 'I know the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken, for He is right beside me. No wonder my heart is filled with joy, and my mouth shouts His praises! My body rests in safety.' (Psalm 16:8-9 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My help comes from the Lord...' Psalm 121:2 NKJ<br /><br />Did you hear about the guy who prayed, 'Lord, so far today I've done all right. I haven't gossiped, lost my temper, been nasty, greedy or grumpy. But in a few minutes I'm gonna have to get out of bed, then I'm gonna need all the help I can get.' <br /><br />
<p>We smile, but the truth is, we need God more than we let on. Sure, prayer comes in handy when we've got that exam coming up or that relationship to mend, but we can blank God out when it comes to irritable parts of our behaviour. Like when we lose our cool, or we come across that bit of juicy goss about that semi-friend that we've just <strong>got</strong> to post on Facebook? Well, we could always pray for more patience or that God will give us the strength to do what's right. When things seem so rotten we think we may as well bring the whole world down with us, maybe we could look for ways to bring God's goodness into the situation.</p>
<p>God's help doesn't have to be reserved solely for all the crisis situations in your life. You can ask for help in your everyday stresses and strains, you can ask for help in gently refining your character, you can even ask for help on behalf of others.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...that it might go well with [you].' Deuteronomy 5:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>When God tells you to do something that seems difficult or unpleasant, He's not trying to make your life hard or put you in a straitjacket. Often He's just getting you to a place where He can bless you: 'Oh, that...[they]...would...keep all My commands always, so that it might go well with them.'</p>
<p>Everything God asks you to do carries this thought with it: <i>that it might go well with you.</i> Living in peace, instead of going to pieces, is easier when you learn to respond to God immediately. Don't hesitate. Don't negotiate. Don't rationalise. And whatever you do, don't run. The only thing that's worse than running away from God is living with the painful aftermath. Your disobedience can take you all the way to the bottom. If you doubt that, stop and read the story of Jonah.</p>
<p>The prophet Samuel said, 'to obey is better than sacrifice.' (1 Samuel 15:22 NIV) The truth is, sometimes you'll have to sacrifice certain things in order to obey God. But it's better to do that than to ignore His voice, live stressed out, forfeit His blessings, and end up getting nowhere. </p>
<p>Sometimes God will require things of you that He doesn't seem to require of others; things that He won't explain, and you can't understand; even things that when you've obeyed them, you won't immediately see the benefits of. But if you're convinced that He loves you and has a plan for your life, you'll surrender to Him in trust, knowing that in the end it will indeed <i>go well with you</i>.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall remember it as waters that pass away.' Job 11:16 AMP<br /><br /><p>Job had an exemplary track record and still he was knocked down. Some people live fast and play loose with the rules and get what they deserve. Not Job: he got a large portion of undeserved suffering. He lost children through natural disasters. He lost everything he ever worked for through unforeseen circumstances. His marriage took the strain of his faith. And to top it all: the doctor's results came in, and it wasn't good news at all. </p>
<p>Job's 'ad-man's dream life' was flushed away and he was left with lots of questions-questions he may never have found answers for, this side of Heaven anyway. Job was bewildered; Job was outraged; Job eventually protested to God. But still the pain ate away at his heart. And in the midst of his suffering his pain was hammered home daily by his 'friends'. </p>
<p>Ever notice how some people slow down to look at a car crash? Well, that's Job's 'I told you so' mates. They showed up hourly trying to identify and fix Job's problems. They reduced God's invitation to follow Him into sure-fire formulas of 'do this and don't do that', 'think this and don't think that'. Hey presto, life is bound to be rosy again. Zophar even went as far as to suggest: 'You will forget your trouble and darkness will seem like morning.' (Job 11:16 NCV) To Job's credit, he rejects all the glib answers and stays honest in the face of old clich. His persistence allows God, in time, to talk through the troubles. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But Christ gave Himself...one sacrifice for all time.' Hebrews 10:12 TLB<br /><br /><p>The lamb struggled as the priest wrestled it to the altar. With one firm hand on its writhing body, he brought the blade down onto the innocent animal. Its blood was poured out for the sins of many. Soon smoke would rise to the heavens and, as a sign that sins were forgiven, the priest would stand on the remaining ashes sprinkled to the ground. </p>
<p>The picture for burning up sin in the Old Testament was a gruesome one. And yet every year the same picture was re-enacted: sin had to paid for again and again. The New Testament would draw an even bloodier picture. Replace the innocent lamb with an innocent man. With one firm hand on His body, a soldier brought down a hammer onto His hands. His blood was poured out for the sins of many. A cross was pointed to the heavens and, as a sign that sins were forgiven, a man died in between two criminals. </p>
<p>Every year around autumn that picture is remembered as the one-off payment for sins forever-Easter. If you've been struggling with what you've done or what you keep doing, don't beat yourself up-your one-off forever payment has already been made. 'Your sins have been forgiven because of Jesus.' (1 John 2:12 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My God shall supply all your need...' Philippians 4:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'<i>Has anybody got the number of a good catering firm? We've got five thousand rumbling tummies and one packed lunch between us</i>.' </p>
<p>'<i>Well I suppose we could</i>Send them away, that they may go...and buy themselves bread.' (Mark 6:36 NKJ) </p>
<p>'<i>we are days away from the nearest supermarket! Wait!</i>' 'There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?' (John 6:9 NKJ)</p>
<p>'<i>Good point. I suppose the starving crowds could watch us munch away on sardine sandwiches. What's that you say, Jesus? You want us to turn lunch for one into brunch for 5000?</i>'</p>
<p>So you haven't got much-but in God's hands you've more than enough. Basketfuls of leftovers, in fact. In your eyes you may be seriously lacking a friend or some money or talent or whatever, but take your 'lack of' in trust to Jesus because He can supply all your need. Jesus asked the disciples to follow His orders and, when they did, a miracle feast for thousands was the result. </p>
<p>You can ask God for a miracle but you'll need to follow His instructions and go along with His plan. 'May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who loved us and by His grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.' (2 Thessalonians 2:16-17 NIV) </p>

Psalm 27:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Feel like there's always some bruiser of a situation rugby-tackling you from behind? When the hard times throw you to the ground, you're not alone. Check out Paul's 'tough time' catalogue! </p>
<p>'I have...been in danger from rivers, thieves, my own people, the Jews, and those who are not Jews. I have been in danger in cities...and on the sea and...with false Christians. I have done hard and tiring work, and many times I did not sleep. I have been hungry and thirsty...without food...cold and without clothes. Besides all this, there is on me every day the load of my concern for all the churches.' (2 Corinthians 11:26-28 NCV) Phew! Had he handed in a '<i>Please excuse Paul from anything churchy</i>' note from his mum, you'd have understood!</p>
<p>How did Paul handle these experiences? By 'forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.' (Philippians 3:13 NLT) Now, Paul didn't actually forget any of it-he could remember names, places and faces-but here's the difference: he refused to let all the trouble of the past influence him. He turned history into <i>destiny</i>. That's the kind of brainwave you need to surf as well. Press 'Delete' on the past and hit 'Enter' on your future. Have the faith that saw the Psalmist through: 'I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I heard these things, I sat down and wept.' Nehemiah 1:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nehemiah is far from home when he receives the bad news from his brother Hanani: Jerusalem has become a joke. Her very walls are stripped and looted to the bare bones. Once the most beautiful and godly city in the world, now Jerusalem looks like a condemned shack with boarded-up windows. Thieves raided her daily, neighbours spat on her; Jerusalem was treated like a dirty, smelly beggNehemiah's heart was broken. He had to do something about it.</p>
<p>Any work of God starts with weeping. Before laying a single brick, Nehemiah had to be broken. And there's a lesson for us there: passionate talks at summer festivals or heart-wrenching images of the poor may be enough to get us out of the blocks but only tears will sustain us. Unless God's broken us, it's all too easy to give up when the going gets tough. We're distracted by next year's bright idea, we forget why we signed up or we feel let down because it's all too hard.</p>
<p>The thorn that God places in your heart is the best motivation you'll ever need to keep going when the going gets tough. Nehemiah weeps, fasts and prays for days before making his first move to rebuild Jerusalem. Are you in two minds about your calling? Ask God to break your heart with what breaks His. Spend time in solid prayer. Deprive yourself of something time-consuming in order to focus on God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Our light affliction...is working for us.' 2 Corinthians 4:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>in Oz we'd like nothing more than sun-and-surf weather 24/7, 365. Being burnt like overdone toast is what we Aussies do best! Yet the wheat in the fields, the cotton in the country and the spuds in the ground wouldn't be too glad of all sunshine and no rain. To get the best out of God's creation it's essential there are other seasons besides the sunny one. </p>
<p>The same is true of the seasons in your faith life. If everything you touched turned to sunshiny gold, it wouldn't be too long before head-swell set in. That's why God also allows us to go through rainy seasons and tough times to grow us. There's nothing quite as ugly as arrogance and God didn't build us to be self-sufficient but God-sufficient. The storms of life lead us to shelter under God's wings, and getting closer to Him can only be a good thing. </p>
<p>Today's verse can seem back-to-front because Paul is saying the misery he's facing works to his advantage. Paul is wise enough to recognise that his weakness is bringing out God's strength: with less of him there is more room for God. What a great way of thinking! Perhaps that's why he could write from experience, 'This foolish plan of God is far wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God's weakness is far stronger than the greatest of human strength.' (1 Corinthians 1:25 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea.' Exodus 15:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Pharaoh did not want to be seen as a weak king amongst the nations, folding like a house of cards under the pressure. For 400 years his predecessors had kept the Hebrew people in slavery. </p>
<p>Ok, swarms of locusts had devoured the crops, the Nile had turned blood red and there had been the death of all the firstborn. But as Pharaoh's officials had pointed out, these things were mere coincidences, surely? Now he had to enslave them once more-for his own dignity, at least. So, as the Israelites hurried between the walls of sea, Pharaoh and his men stormed after them like bounty hunters on a mission.</p>
<p>For generations, the Jews would remember how those deafening waves came rolling down on Pharaoh and his armies. And as they sang, 'Pharaoh's chariots and his army He cast into the sea' they would remind themselves of God's intervention in their troubles. They would recall the dividing line between their past and their future. God had saved them when all looked hopeless.</p>
<p>The story reminds us that if God did it for them, He'll do it for us too. Whatever circumstance has you enslaved, God can break through it. He will provide a passage through your sea of trouble and step by step you'll be able to walk in faith into a new future. Meanwhile your haunted past will be drowned for good in the tumbling waves.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['[The] parts...that seem...least important are...most necessary.' 1 Corinthians 12:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>Paul massages his fingers into his temples. Maybe it's because he hasn't eaten or drunk water for days. He must be dehydrated. Or perhaps it's the lack of daylight in this damp, dank, dark jail. Or the lack of oxygen in the two by two metre cell. Or the stress of not knowing whether tomorrow he lives or dies. Perhaps he feels homesick for his Christian brothers and sisters around the world: the wild bunch in Corinth, the joy brigade in Philippi, the bedrock foundation in Jerusalem. Whatever the reason, Paul feels another headache coming on. </p>
<p>He's at a real low. When he hears the footsteps on hard ground down the corridor, he hopes with all his heart it's Onesiphorus. The wild-eyed former slave has visited him most days this past year. Each day he comes with a smile and a hungry heart. His growing faith has been a much-needed source of encouragement for Paul in prison.</p>
<p><i>Onesiphorus who</i>? Ok, so his name doesn't trip off the tongue quite as easily as Peter or Paul. He's only mentioned twice in the entire Bible. And yet this unknown hero of the faith is a source of strength to an incarcerated Paul. Don't bother asking why God makes some names known and others not-so-known. The point is that everyone, whether named or unnamed, contributes to God's Kingdom. So be encouraged-you may be anonymous but you're essential to the great plan.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The pure in heart...shall see God.' Matthew 5:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There's this film called <i>Super Size Me</i> where documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock conducts his own dietary experiment. Every meal for a whole month he eats only food from burger chain McDonald's. Surprise, surprise, by the end of his junk food binge we've learned that a regime of Big Mac and fries is not the best idea for your arteries. Likewise, the Bible teaches us that unconfessed sin is not great for your spiritual arteries. </p>
<p>The Psalmist writes, 'Who may stand in [Your] holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart... He will receive blessing from the Lord.' (Psalm 24:3-5 NIV) If we want 'God's go-ahead' stamped over our lives we need a healthy heart-none of this sin-junk congealing at the core of us. </p>
<p>Jesus said, 'Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.' The problem is not God's inability to be seen, but our inability to see Him. No wonder David prayed, 'Create in me a pure heart.' (Psalm 51:10 NIV) This word <i>pure</i> is from the Greek word <i>katharos</i>, which means 'to clean out'. Maybe you don't want to hear it but perhaps your heart needs a spiritual cleansing. Through prayer and fasting, flush out all those nasty sin toxins and clean out your clogged saintly arteries.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ has set us free.' Galatians 5:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Moses has got so much to answer for! First there were voices from smouldering shrubbery, then there came frogs and locusts on the weather report and before long there was a whole set of instructions... </p>
<p>The Ten Commandments arrived on blocks of stone but Moses cracked the first set in a rage. So, God carved some more-the trouble is nobody (but Jesus) has cracked how to keep them since. All these rules and regulations have a funny way of highlighting how far we have missed the mark. For all of us who've drooled in envy over next door's new car, mobile phone or sheer good looks, there's a rule: 'Do not covet.' For all of us who've daydreamed about peeking in the dressing room of the opposite sex, there's a rule: 'No lusting.' And for all us best mates who've dared to utter the immortal words, 'No, I never told anyone!' there's a rule: 'Quit with the lies.' </p>
<p>All in all, the standard is so high we'd be doing pretty well if we managed to peel ourselves out of bed before breaking one of these rules. If our salvation depended on us keeping every letter of God's law we'd have no chance. Thankfully, God made a way for us even though we don't live up to perfect standards-He sent His Son Jesus to make us right with Him. Now the rule is to do what Jesus instructed His disciples: '<i>Follow Me</i>.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray for...all who have authority.' 1 Timothy 2:2 NCV<br /><br /><p>Maybe your grandad was right when he said, 'Kids of today-they've got no respect!' We've no respect for the Government: 'This Prime Minister is running the country into the ground...' We've no respect for the Police: 'They should be out catching real criminals!' And we've very little respect for the older generation.</p>
<p>1 Timothy reminds us to respect those who have been elected: 'Pray for...all who have authority.' It's easy to jump on the media bandwagon and slate all those in government but not quite so easy to humble yourself and pray for their strength of character. And for the police- maybe instead of muttering about unsolved crime, pray for discernment in law enforcement, thanking God that we're not a lawless nation. As for older people, some cultures have it sorted: the oldest in the community are given a rightful place at the top of the pecking order. </p>
<p>It pleases God when we pray for those in authority. When our prayers allow God to influence the influencers of our world it has to be win/win right? James 1:5 NLT says, 'If you need wisdom, ask...God, and He will give it to you.' Don't we want our leaders to have the wisdom of God? Well then, call out to God for them. Our world is plagued with war, economic crises, trafficking, terrorism-our leaders need the advice of God more than the moaning of men. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['To everything there is a season...' Ecclesiastes 3:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>No matter how hard you pray, you can't pray your life's seasons away. There are some situations you aren't meant to change-you're just meant to survive! Paul calls these times, '...light and momentary troubles...' (2 Corinthians 4:17 NIV) When you can't change your circumstances you've just got to learn to grow through them.</p>
<p>In winter, trees take advantage of the season to rebuild their strength and prepare to be fruitful next season. Their sap and substance goes underground. Then in the spring it pushes its way back up again in the form of new growth. Looking back over your life you'll find that your achievements are seasonal. Growth comes, then struggle, and so on. Each season has its purpose. God has a reason for not wanting you to be productive all the time. When He allows wintry weather to blow through your life He's getting you ready for spring. One of the issues you'll struggle with through a winter waiting time is the urge to hurry, to make big permanent decisions based on circumstances that are about to change. Don't do it! Every situation doesn't need immediate action. Remember, patience comes from trust, and you can't trust a God you don't know. That's why you need to spend more time getting chilling out with Him and reading His instruction manual. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV)<br /><br /><p>David knew that God had called him before he went to work for King Saul! That's important! You've got to know who you are, not just what you do; otherwise you'll end up working harder at being appreciated than you will at doing your job. That not only sends the wrong signal to your work-mates and supervisors, it also robs you of the solid foundation of security, peacefulness and joy your job provides. God has called you by name, so don't let your self-worth swing like a politician's popularity in an election year, up one day and down the next. You'll end up riding a roller coaster of moodiness and unexpected disappointments. Occasionally you'll enjoy moments of praise, but they may not be sincere, for once others learn you thrive on recognition, they hold the key to manipulating you for their own purposes. So trust your calling, not their opinions.</p>
<p>Thirsting for recognition gives others power over you. That's dangerous! It's hard to hear God's voice when you have tuned your ears to respond to your peer group. Listen: '...whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV) So strive for God's pleasure in everything you do. Put your heart into your work today, doing it all for the glory of God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Confess your faults one to another.' James 5:16 KJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes God asks us to do things that can seem stupid or scary, like this for example: 'Confess your faults one to another.' How stupid does that sound? No one in their right mind wants their bad behaviour made front page news! How scary would it be letting someone know the stuff you spend all your time trying to hide? Why would God ask us to do this?</p>
<p>With God there is always a good reason. When we try and hide bad habits, we give them a stronger hold on us. They become harder to stop and difficult to break. But the moment we tell someone it begins to lose its power. The Bible says, 'Pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! ...Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves.' (Ecclesiastes 4:10-12 NIV) God never intended us to go through life dealing with the tough stuff alone which is why He says, 'Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another, that you may be healed.' </p>
<p>If there's something in your life that you're keeping secret, if you are struggling to break a habit that's trying to break you, talk to someone about it today. But who? Tell who? Someone you can trust, maybe someone who's been through what you're going through, but definitely someone who's compassionate, someone who'll pray with you, someone who'll hold you accountable, someone who'll keep your confidence. Ask God to help find you the right person and then confess your faults, and let God heal you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['One thing I do...' Philippians 3:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Many Christians look more like a kid in the egg and spoon race than a sleek, speedy Kenyan in a marathon. We stumble and fumble in our Christian race trying to balance the egg on the spoon, not really running in a straight line-whereas we should be taking elegant stride after stride, steady and focused, running with sustained stamina.</p>
<p>Kenya has a rich tradition of producing the world's best endurance runners. Their athletes tend to run from the front in threes. They work as a team, setting the pace together and taking it in turns to do the hard bit in leading. If we're going to do the hard bit of leading we would do well to surround ourselves with like-minded, spiritually-fit Christians to urge us on in our running. </p>
<p>Kenyan athletes tend to make distant running look like poetry, gliding round the track with presence and purpose. We'd do well to command an authority like theirs in our circles; to move with a similar determination in our run with God. Kenyan athletes tend to save fuel for a final burst in the last lap. We should be so built up in prayer reserves that we can surprise any opposition with a sudden kick when needed. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['His father called him Benjamin.' Genesis 35:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You could have heard the screams right across the camp. Long into the night the woman tossed and turned on her bed. The midwife mopped the sweat from the woman's forehead. Each pain, each contraction made Jacob wince. This was hard labour. Hard, hard labour. And there were no epidurals, no gas and air, no nothing out there in the desert. The woman strained to push, colour drained from her face-the unborn child was taking the very life from Rachel. She was barely conscious as she gasped these last words: 'Name the child Ben-oni, for he is <i>the son of my pain</i>.' </p>
<p>Moments later Jacob cradled his newborn son, taken from the lifeless arms of his deceased wife. From that moment on, every time Jacob looked into the eyes of his son he saw the eyes of his wife. He would remember the pain and the way life seemed to drift out of her eyes at the very moment he held his son for the first time. And so <i>son of my pain</i> seemed an apt name. Yet Jacob renamed the child 'Benjamin', <i>son of my right hand</i>. Benjamin would not be a reminder of pain but of God's sovereign power.</p>
<p>So hear this: you are who <i>God</i> says you are, not who <i>others</i>say you are! Only believe what God says about you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God has appointed...teachers...' 1 Corinthians 12:28 NKJ<br /><br /><p>So what do you remember teachers for? Their talent for steaming at the ears over a forgotten set of PE gear? Their gift for sending students to sleep? No doubt you've had many good teachers growing up.</p>
<p>The best teachers seem to have an effortless knack of drawing you into their world. They don't so much pass on information as make it come to life. They have the power to inspire and motivate. They help you see the planet at an entire new tilt. </p>
<p>Take Jesus. He was a young, magnetic teacher with the skill to make fishermen put down their nets and walk away from their jobs for unpaid employment. He was such a fascinating speaker he could bring a whole working city to a standstill just to hear one of his lectures. His teachings are so compelling they can still draw millions of people around the globe to hear them on a Sunday two thousand years after He first taught them. </p>
<p>Real teaching doesn't stay in a textbook-it writes itself into the lives of its students. Jesus taught about justice and so William Wilberforce determined to abolish the slave trade. Jesus taught about poverty and so William Booth opened hostels, hospitals, schools and soup kitchens. Jesus taught wherever He went and so John Wesley covered over twelve thousand kilometres a year by horseback in order to preach.

<introtext><![CDATA['Noah, warned by God...[saved] his household.' Hebrews 11:7 NRS<br /><br /><p>The sales assistant sniggered when he sold the old man such a large amount of wood. 'A boat! You're going to build a boat in the outback. Good luck!' Then he added, 'Oh, and the wood is non-returnable.'</p>
<p>The neighbours complained to the local council; the thing was so big it blocked the view from their windows. And finally, when the animals started arriving, so did the animal rights protesters. They objected to the dark, cramped conditions the poor critters were subjected to by this religious nutter. What had possessed Noah to take up the world's craziest woodwork project in the first place? </p>
<p>The answer was faith. All the doubters and gripers could see with their own eyes was what a ludicrous thing Noah was attempting. But Noah had heard from God. He must've been really close to God to hear such a thing. Nobody else was busy boat-building. Everybody else was oblivious to the approaching danger. Noah must've had some pretty interesting prayer-journal entries going in order to decide to act upon what he heard. Nobody builds a massive boat in the middle of nowhere. Not unless you distinctly hear God, anyway. </p>
<p>Noah saved his family and, ultimately, humankind through his act of faith. God has some saving assignments for you too-but unless you stay close, you'll never hear the instructions.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.' 1 Timothy 4:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>A kid sits staring out a classroom window. The sun is shining on the sports field, some kids in PE gear are playing cricket. 'And here am I stuck in RE learning nothing,' he thinks to himself. But as he looks at the bright clear skies, something amazing happens. A face seems to appear like lightning in the blue cloudless heavens. The sun is sparkling all around and yet there is lightning. And a voice cracks open the earth, louder than a volcano erupting at the next desk.</p>
<p>Yet the kids still chase a ball on the field, classmates keep their heads in textbooks. A finger like a flaming torch shoots through the window and touches the kid's lips. 'Before you even made an appearance on your mum's first baby scan, I'd singled you out. I'm giving you the job of my top spokesperson for the world.'</p>
<p>Jeremiah looks around. The teacher takes a swig of coffee and continues with his marking. 'Me? A spokes-what? But I'm just a kid. I haven't even taken my final exams yet!' </p>
<p>The kid next to him covers his answers. 'Never believe the I'm too young thing.' </p>
<p>And with that, Jeremiah shot across the room with the sheer power of the words he was given. Youth and inexperience do not disqualify when God calls. The beginning of Jeremiah's story shows that God always equips and supports those He appoints despite their lack of years or job history.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord has blessed me for your sake.' Genesis 30:27 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jacob: 'I want to go back home. Let me take my wives and children...and let me be on my way. You know I have fully paid for them with my service to you.' (Genesis 30:25-26 NLT)</p>
<p>Laban had to think fast. He knew how things had improved ever since Jacob had arrived. A few straggly animals had turned to fields of grazing cattle under Jacob's care. Sheep were producing knitwear, cows were manufacturing milkshake and the goats' cheese never tasted so good. What with all the free home-help supplied by Jacob's ever-expanding family tree, Laban would have been a fool to let him up and off without trying to change his mind. So that very same day Jacob's father-in-law plotted and schemed to keep his good thing going. He might have been a schemer but the old fella knew a thing or two: 'Please stay. I know the Lord has blessed me because of you.' (Genesis 30:27 NCV)</p>
<p>If you want to get God's best for your life, stick like Velcro to someone or something He's blessing. Proverbs 13:20 NLT puts it like this: 'Whoever walks with the wise will become wise.' And if you really, really want God's good stuff, take the reins yourself and do for them what you want done for you: 'Those who help others will themselves be helped.' (Proverbs 11:25 NCV) Learn to recognise what and where God blesses and throw your best into the mix.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['First sit down and estimate the cost...' Luke 14:28 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>Big</i> is the story of a twelve year old kid catapulted into an adult world. Thanks to a spooky attraction at a funfair a school kid becomes trapped inside the body of an adult (played by Tom Hanks). For the first time in his life he finds himself with a job and more money than he knows what to spend it on. He buys himself giant trampolines and every gadget going, and feasts on milkshakes and squirty cream for tea. But eventually he's confronted with complex relationships, backstabbing business colleagues and tight work deadlines. The kid realises he's just not ready for life as an adult and so another wish propels him back to life as a twelve year old.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a touch of this kind of impatience yourself. You think you're ready to take on the world. </p>
<p>You may be big enough but are you mature enough? If God has planned stuff for you, don't be in a rush to receive it before its time. 'Wait for it; because it will surely come.' (Habakkuk 2:3 NKJ) Are you ready to pay the price? Are you <i>able</i> to pay the price? Stick it out and stay in God's timing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['How often shall...I forgive him?' Matthew 18:21 NKJ
<p>You have to wonder why Peter asked Jesus this question. Maybe he was angry, and the 'taking deep breaths and doing the count-to-ten' thing hadn't helped at all. 'Jesus-how many times do I forgive someone who hurts me?' he asked, staring at the back of the person who hurt him.</p>
<p>Probably there was an answer already playing around in Peter's head. And if there was you can bet it involved Peter coming out on top, looking righteous and superior and the other guy getting his just deserts. But all done in good Christian 'love' of course! - yeah right! Surely Jesus would confirm to him that forgiving seven times was incredibly gracious!</p>
<p>Jesus' actual answer suggests you shouldn't try to put a number on how many times you should forgive. Whether you think it or not, people always deserve a second chance. And a third chance. And a fourth-you get the idea. Where would we all be without second chances? After all, Jesus taught us to pray: 'forgive us as we forgive...' (Luke 11:4 GWT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' 1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Corinth was a place that really mixed it up when it came to different cultures and religions. Loads of different gods were thrown together in that place, a bit like a salad with 'a bit of this, and a bit of that' (only not quite so healthy). </p>
<p>Paul brought the Gospel of Jesus Christ into this mixed-up place and soon a church was established. Later Paul wrote passionately to the church about how to live among unbelievers: 'I have become a servant of everyone so that I can bring them to Christ...I fit in with [different people] as much as I can. In this way, I gain their confidence and bring them to Christ. But I do not discard the law of God; I obey the law of Christ...I try to find common ground with everyone so that I might bring them to Christ. I do all this to spread the Good News, and in doing so I enjoy its blessings.' (1 Corinthians 9:19-23 NLT) </p>
<p>Are you enjoying its blessings too? It's so important to <i>not</i> be cooped up in a bubble with just you and your Christian mates. Paul would tell you to pop that bubble and open your life to those around you who need Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' 1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul wasn't a bloke who just talked the talk. He didn't do anything by halves. He fully invested in walking the walk-living rightly as well as preaching the Gospel. His passion-fuelled letters encouraged the church in Corinth to follow his example. He said things like: 'Get your joggers on and really run the life you've been given to glorify Him!'</p>
<p>Here he is again in chapter 9 of 1 Corinthians: 'Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but only one receives the prize? So run your race that you may lay hold of the prize and make it yours. Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things. They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither, but we do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness that cannot wither. Therefore I do not run uncertainly. I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversary. But like a boxer I buffet my body and subdue it.' (1 Corinthians 9:24-27 AMP)</p>
<p>Paul packs a punch, eh? Whether he inspires you or makes you twitch coz he reminds you of your whistle-blowing PE teacher, he does make a good point. Make your life count. Invest in eternity!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A dinner was prepared in Jesus' honour. Martha served, and Lazarus sat...with Him.' John 12:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Pots and pans clattered in the kitchen. Martha couldn't believe her sister was sitting doing nothing. There were guests to be fed, tables to be set, drinks to be served. And there was Mary-dearest, all gooey-eyed at Jesus' feet. </p>
<p>Mary, on the other hand, couldn't believe the fuss her sister was making. If looks could kill, Martha would be up for triple homicide. Couldn't she understand that Jesus was here? Spreading fish paste on sandwiches could wait-this was a once-in-forever opportunity; the Son of God was in full flow on their sofa!</p>
<p>Lazarus had no time for the disagreement. Sure, his sisters were having a bit of a hissy fit, but things would turn out right. They always did. That was Lazarus' take on life ever since he was saved from the clutches of death. Nothing like a near-death experience to give you a fresh 'life is too short' outlook on things! </p>
<p>Which are you? Marthas tend to prioritise mission over the master. Marys need to realise that service is worship too. Lazaruses could do with checking in with the everyday world now and again. And yet, without Martha, practicalities are missed. Without Mary, passion in worship is lacking. Without Lazarus, we're deprived of amazing testimonies. Truth is they all have their place at the table. And if they can see past the squabbles-as a unit they're one dynamic team not to be messed with. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm...' Isaiah 26:3 GNT<br /><br /><p>What is it with some people? Their DNA seems to be made up of moans, groans and complaints. They expect the world to entertain and pamper them and when the world fails to comply, they act like a two-year old! Problems arise when you run your engine on premium tantrums. But find your purpose in life and your ride will be a whole load smoother. </p>
<p>For instance, ever noticed how some people seemed to have meetings dead-locking their diary but never seem to be actually achieving anything? Being busy doesn't necessarily mean you're being effective. When you're not clear about your purpose, you'll try to do too much. The reality is you'll only ever have enough time and energy to do God's will. Jesus was able to say, 'It is finished' after just thirty-three years because He never strayed from His purpose.</p>
<p>Know your purpose and you'll know peace: 'You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm.' Knowing your purpose gives you momentum. Instead of scratching around in the dark trying to figure out how you could make a name for yourself, pray. God created you for His purposes-why not download your destiny direct from Heaven? Your momentum, your drive, your energy should all come from your prayer life. Trying to change the world through sheer muscle and brain cells is always going to be second best to impacting the planet God's way.</p>

<p>Yep, it's dead easy to get caught in the trap of <i>doing</i>-'evangelising your mates', 'looking after kids in Sunday school', 'planning a youth outreach event'-and all the while missing out on just <i>being</i>. While you're keeping your fingers crossed that God will smile down on all your good works, you're missing out on precious 'you and God' time. </p>
<p>God isn't a hobby, a side-project or a hard task. When we treat Him like that we're on the slippery slope to burnout. Without God's love to motivate us, needy people become just pains in the neck; Sunday school kids become a bit of free babysitting; youth outreach events become another hectic date in the diary. </p>
<p>Without God we lose the focus of why we do what we do. So how do we get our eye back on the ball? What is the antidote to burnout? Matthew 11:28-30 NCV has the answer: 'Come to Me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. Accept My teachings and learn from Me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit, and you will find rest for your lives. The teaching that I ask you to accept is easy; the load I give you to carry is light.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...laid aside His garments.' John 13:3-4 NKJ<br /> <br />In John 13 we read how after supper, Jesus took off His outer garments and filled a bowl of water to wash His disciples' feet... <br /><br />'Errr, sit down, Jesus! Washing smelly feet's not your business! And anyway you've got the timing all wrong for it. You know, when we've just come in from journeying down those dusty roads, kicked off our sandals and our feet are revealed in all their dirty glory, that's when they need a good washin'! Anyway, more to the point, in case you haven't noticed, Jesus, you're Jewish! Business with feet is for non-Jewish slaves! Sit down, you're better than all that.' <br /><br />That's what the disciples were probably thinking even if they didn't say it. With His crucifixion imminent, Jesus washes their feet as a final outpouring of His love for them. It's a real example of humility and what it means to be servant-hearted. <br /><br />It's an example of how we should be with our mates and family-not seeing ourselves above anyone or anything, but as willing to serve one another. It's also a reminder of how we are called to love our enemies: Jesus washed all of His disciples' feet, including those of Judas-who He knew would soon betray Him. By Jesus taking off His outer garments to do this also brought a sense of vulnerability. We can learn from this too. Don't cover up who you are!<br /><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 11-13, Matt 15:1-14, Ps 149, Pr 4:25-27<br /><br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>word4U2day <em>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</em> is published under licence by UCB Australia.   2012 UCB International Ltd<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=33231&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></span>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be kind to one another, tender hearted...' Ephesians 4:32 NKJ<br /> <br />Jesus is crystal clear that the greatest commandment is: Love God with everything you've got. He doesn't leave us guessing about the second either: Love people the way you'd like to be loved. <br /><br />The key word here is 'commandment'. A command is an order-not a nice idea, an order. Nazi Germany wasn't defeated in the Second World War because somebody had a nice idea; success came from scores of obedient men and women following strict orders. Likewise, God's Kingdom won't be made visible if we pick and choose Jesus' 'nice ideas'. Loving people is an order of the highest importance if we're serious in making God known. <br /><br />Loving people means being quick to forgive. So many of us have got 'Don't double-cross me' tattooed on our hearts-which only adds to all that's wrong in our world. Forgiveness releases our grip around someone's neck. <br /><br />Loving people means serving. Jesus washed His disciples' grubby smelly feet. If the King of the Heavens can do that, then surely we can put the jug on for a mate. <br /><br />Loving people means practicing kindness. A kind word, a friendly smile, an unexpected email, a surprise gift through the post-they're all small ways of revealing God's Kingdom. But don't just take our word for it: 'The command that Christ has given us is this: whoever loves God must love others also.'

<introtext><![CDATA['Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with [God]...' Genesis 35:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Do you like looking at your holiday pics to remember the good times you've had away from home? It's great to look back and remember, especially when it's one of those 'miserable Mondays'. Looking back and remembering good times can really cheer us up-laughing at the clothes we used to wear; seeing our mates being silly; remembering all the different places we've been and experiences we've had.</p>
<p>Did you know that words for 'remember' are mentioned well over 200 times in the Bible? It is important to God that we 'remember the days of long ago.' (Deuteronomy 32:7 NLT)</p>
<p>They didn't have photographs in Bible times so they used other things to help them remember good times. For example, 'Jacob set up a stone pillar to mark the place where God had spoken' (Genesis 35:14 NLT); 'The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar &quot;Witness&quot;, for they said, &quot;It is a witness between us and them that the Lord is our God, too.&quot;' (Joshua 22:34 NLT); 'Samuel took a stone...set it up...and called [it]...Ebenezer, saying, &quot;Thus far the Lord has helped us.&quot;' (1 Samuel 7:12 NKJ); 'Jacob presented a sacrifice to God and invited everyone to a feast.' (Genesis 31:54 NLT)</p>
<p>When we're in a spiritual slump it helps us get back on track when we look back and remember all the great things God has done. Remembering God's promises (over 3000 of them) fills us with hope again. God's promises are like the stars-the darker the night, the brighter they shine.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world...' John 18:37 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jim Peterson writes, 'Three elements of personality are involved in making a decision to become a Christian, or in making any significant decision for that matter. They are the emotions, the intellect, and the will.</p>
<p>'For example, a young man meets a young woman. They are immediately attracted to one another. They both say to themselves, &quot;Now there is someone I'd like to marry.&quot; At that point, if the emotions had their way, there would be a wedding. But the intellect intervenes, questioning the impulsive emotional response. Would we be compatible? What is she really like? Can I afford to support her? Both conclude it would be better to take some more time and answer a few questions before they proceed.</p>
<p>'So the two begin spending more time with each other. He eventually concludes that she is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. Now his intellect has sided with the emotions on the idea of marriage. But the final and heaviest vote remains to be cast-that of the will. It stops the march toward the altar with the questions, &quot;Am I willing to give up this lifestyle for another? What about my freedom, is it worth the trade? Am I willing to assume the added responsibility?&quot; The marriage will occur only when the will finally agrees with the emotions and the intellect.'*</p>
<p>Let your will, intellect <em>and</em> emotions agree to follow Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I don't care what happens to me...' Acts 20:24 CEV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'I don't know what will happen to me...I don't care...as long as I finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do.'</p>
<p>Paul wasn't wishing his life away, far from it. Instead he had realised that he had taken hold of something much, much, more valuable: Jesus. Paul may have seemed like a sold-out radical to people around him, maybe even suicidal, because of his insistence on walking into pretty nasty situations carrying Jesus' name and message high. He may have looked like he'd completely lost the plot, but he was working to a different set of priorities: 'For me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.' (Philippians 1:21 NIV)</p>
<p>What about that new mp3 player? That new phone? That new pair of jeans or accessory that you <i>have</i> to get your hands on as soon as you get the chance? What about that boy or girl you've had your eye on? While these things can be harmless in themselves, sometimes they feel like they're all that life's about. Paul didn't take any half-measures with distractions-he let that kind of life die in him. Instead he lived completely to do Jesus' work, and looked forward to an eternity with Him when it was all over. What matters most to you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord God appeared as a blazing fire in a bush.' Exodus 3:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Moses must have been totally impressed when God appeared to Him in a burning bush that didn't burn up. Things that leave a lasting impression are not always found where you'd expect.</p>
<p>Here's some questions based on the philosophy of Charles Schulz, the creator of the <i>Peanuts</i> comic strip. 1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world. 2. Name the last five Australian cricket captains. 3. Name the last five winners of Miss Australia. 4 Name ten people who have won the Nobel Prize. 5. Name the last 5 Academy Award winners for best actor or actress. 6. Name the last 5 World Cup winners.</p>
<p>The point is, none of us remember all the headliners of yesterday. These were no second-rate achievers-they were the best in their fields-in their day. But the applause dies, awards tarnish, achievements are forgotten.</p>
<p>Here's another<i>better</i>-quiz: 1. List a few teachers who really helped you through school. 2. Name three friends who were there for you in a difficult time. 3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile. 4. Think of three people who have made you feel appreciated and special. 5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with. </p>
<p>I bet you found that easier. The lesson is clear: the people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money or the most awards. They simply are the ones who care the most. Do you leave a lasting impression?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and courageous.' Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible's full of stories of God telling people not to be afraid: 'Be courageous! Don't chicken out! Stand firm!' We all find ourselves in situations that make us feel like a wimp sandwich with a side serve of limp fries. That's not God's plan for us! Sometimes we've got to be courageous about our own potential-and helping other people with theirs too.</p>
<p>We might be familiar with the idea that each one of us is 'fearfully and wonderfully made' with huge amounts of potential packed inside. But it's often only when someone else spots that potential and draws it out that we actually start to live out our lives based on this powerful truth. </p>
<p>To make sure a person's potential doesn't remain under wraps, we've got to be on the look-out for their strengths and God-given giftings. The words we speak create an environment in which people not only see for themselves they've got gifts, but are also encouraged to grow and develop them. Everyone's been implanted with a God-given purpose in life and we can play a key part in inspiring them to achieve it. If you show you believe in someone's future, then who knows what can happen? </p>
<p>Jesus said, 'With God everything is possible.' (Matthew 19:26 NLT) The question is, do we believe it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and courageous.' Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Simon the Galilean fisherman didn't audition for a role as one of Jesus' disciples. Jesus didn't wow the audience by presenting Simon on a glitzy, high-octane TV show while announcing His plans for the future of the church. Instead, when Simon said Jesus was the Saviour that God had promised, Jesus told him: 'On this rock I will build My church.' (Matthew 16:18 NIV) Jesus also gave Simon a new name and a fresh purpose. Jesus took a lumpy old bit of coal called Simon and turned him into Peter, the rough diamond. </p>
<p>The thing about diamonds is (grab your lab coat, here comes the science bit) they can only be formed if carbon is subjected to specific and intense pressure. None of us is the finished article and God wants to make us more like Christ. This often means we have to go through some pressure-cooker times for those diamonds to be produced. God accepts us just the way we are but He loves us way too much to leave us that way. </p>
<p>If God has something for you to do that makes your fearful just thinking about it, it'll be accompanied with this message: Be strong and courageous. 'I am holding you by your right hand-I, the Lord your God. And I say to you, Do not be afraid. I am here to help you.' (Isaiah 41:13 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and courageous.' Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Halfway up one of the mountains in the Swiss Alps there's a little caf. The mountain itself takes a full day to climb from the bottom to the top but you can usually get to the caf by lunchtime, and that's where the men get separated from the boys. When some amateur climbers feel the warmth of the fire and smell the good cooking they say to their mates, 'I'll just wait here while you go to the top. When you come back down I'll join you and we'll go to the base together.' Relaxation washes over them as they sit by the fire, sipping the strong coffee. But about 3:30 in the afternoon everything changes; they start looking toward the mountaintop as their friends reach it. Suddenly the atmosphere in the caf changes and they think: 'If only I'd kept climbing!' </p>
<p>So what factors decide whether you end up in the caf or on the mountaintop? There are at least three things: (1) TIREDNESS: Jesus told Peter, 'I have prayed for you...that your faith may not fail.' (Luke 22:31-32 NIV) We all have to find strength in Jesus to overcome times of failing faith. (2) FEAR: Some days it seems like vertigo strikes our souls. We can't cope with the height of the mountain and we're tempted to give up. Then a voice whispers, 'Be strong and courageous...for the Lord your God will be with you.' (Joshua 1:9 NIV) (3) COMFORT: Conflict and hard times keep us on our toes-and on our knees-but having it easy all the time can con us into settling down short of our goal. So keep climbing!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and courageous.' Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Can we fix it? Yes we can!' The producers of <i>Bob the Builder</i> had a pretty good understanding that a positive attitude to a problem is the first step towards solving it. But they weren't the first to hit on the idea. Jesus is the Master when it comes to dealing with sticky situations and turning them on their head. </p>
<p>John 8 tells the story of a woman caught in the act of adultery. Not good. Checking their law books, the religious people suggested stoning her to death. But Jesus stepped in with immense compassion and handed her a lifeline: 'I do not condemn you either. Go, but do not sin again.' (John 8:11 GNT) It's likely she'd have gone on from that point trying to live up to Jesus' view of her. The New Testament is full of the idea we should breathe life into people and situations. </p>
<p>So what stops us from sharing the love? Could it be the lure of laziness? Or are we seduced by selfishness? Do we fall down by taking people for granted? Perhaps we're concerned if we say a few nice words, they'll take a rocket ride to Superiority Central. But that wasn't Jesus' concern when He praised Nathanael: 'Now here is a genuine son of Israel-a man of complete integrity.' (John 1:47 NLT) What an amazing compliment! The sad truth is more people die of broken hearts than swelled heads. Ask God today for an opportunity to be a life-breather. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't call me Naomi...call me Mara...' Ruth 1:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>Ask any new parent about the importance of a name and they'll probably gush with the story of how they picked out what to call their little bundle of joy. Throughout the Bible, names are super-significant. They usually tell us about that person's character and identity, with Jesus Christ being the best example: <i>Jesus</i>-'God is our Saviour'; <i>Christ</i>'the Anointed One'. </p>
<p>But in Ruth, we read about a woman who decided on a name change for the . Naomi lost her husband and, later on, both of her sons. She went from Naomi, meaning 'my joy' or 'pleasant' to Mara, meaning 'bitter'. She let her circumstances define her when in reality there were still loads of things in store for Naomi-including mentoring Ruth who would ultimately become an ancestor of Jesus Christ himself! </p>
<p>Sadly, Naomi let pessimism into the driver's seat of her life. It strangled hope within her. Don't let that happen to you. If things around you are changing, embrace the change and roll with it. God's still in control and still has things in store for you too. We might think we've got our life nailed down but God's got an uncanny way of surprising us with what we never thought possible. </p>
<p>So instead of having a Mara mentality, let God have His way: 'By His mighty power at work within us, He is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope.' (Ephesians 3:20-21 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have instructed a widow there to feed you.' 1 Kings 17:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Times are tough. The economy's come to an all-time slump. No one even knows where their next meal's coming from. These were the circumstances facing Elijah, but he didn't lose hope. Elijah knew God, and he knew God's voice when he heard it: 'Go to Zarephath. I have instructed a widow there to feed you.' So Elijah set off to find the woman and invite himself to dinner. </p>
<p>It soon turned out God was going to have to perform a major miracle if Elijah was going to get fed that night. The widow let him know: 'I don't have a single piece of bread.' (1 Kings 17:12 NLT) But Elijah wasn't put off. He delivered God's Word: 'There will always be plenty of flour and oil left in your containers until the time when the Lord sends rain and the crops grow again!' (v14) Sure enough, God fulfilled His promise to provide. </p>
<p>Here are three powerful lessons in provision: (1) When you need it, God's provision is in place; (2) The people God uses might surprise you; (3) Our bad time is God's opportune moment. This lady was all set to savour her last meal on earth. </p>
<p>When God's work has a need, He looks for someone with a seed, stretches their faith, and both the giver and God's work are blessed. You see, one of God's names is <i>Yahweh-Yireh</i>, which means 'God will provide'. He will provide, it's in His DNA. But He'll often wait till we are totally dependent on Him, before we see Him come through for us. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again...' Proverbs 24:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Stand up and take a bow, Winston Churchill. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II, Nobel Prize winner and patron of bow ties and bowler hats (ok, the last bit's not actually true). Yet when asked what prepared him best for the pressures of leading a country to war, he remembered the time he was made to repeat a year of school: 'You failed a year at school?' quizzed the interviewer. 'I never failed anything,' he replied. 'I was given a second opportunity to get it right.'</p>
<p>Our attitude and response to failure is crucial in deciding what we make of our lives. Failing isn't falling down, it's staying down. With God's help, we can keep on getting back up again. Still, it takes guts. Before Jonas Salk developed a vaccine for polio that finally worked, he tried 200 unsuccessful ones. He didn't even use the word 'failure' when talking about that journey of discovery, but instead boldly stated, 'I just discovered 200 ways how not to vaccinate polio.' </p>
<p>Mistakes and 'failures' are part of daring to live the kind of life Jesus lived on earth-full of excitement and even potential danger. The other option is to drift through life, living a 'safe existence' and never taking a single risk. The choice is ours. </p>
<p>So, ask yourself: <i>Is failure when things don't work out the way we hoped or expected? Or is failure not having the courage to risk living out our dreams?</i> </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But I know that even now God will give You whatever You ask.' John 11:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Take off those grave clothes and let him go,' Jesus said. (John 11:44 NIV) Well, it wouldn't really be appropriate for Lazarus to go freaking out the good folk of Bethany looking like a zombie, would it? </p>
<p>Lazarus was Mary and Martha's brother. He'd been dead for four days when Jesus raised him from the dead... In fact, Jesus had received a message from Mary and Martha that Lazarus was sick, but He had delayed coming to help. <i>Delayed?</i> To say they were disappointed in Jesus is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>It's easy to forget that before Jesus performed this amazing miracle, they were in full mourning. Filled with grief, Mary and Martha both questioned Jesus' timing when He finally arrived. 'Lord,' Martha said, 'if You had been here, my brother would not have died.' (John 11:21 NIV)</p>
<p>Are you questioning God's timing or His involvement in a problem or circumstances you're dealing with? Maybe you think that God doesn't seem to be doing anything at all? Even through Martha's pain and confusion, she still didn't deny who Jesus was. She said: 'But I know that even now God will give You whatever You ask.' (John 11:22) </p>
<p>If you're having a <i>'What are You doing, God?'</i> moment, remember God says, 'My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways ... As the Heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways.' (Isaiah 55:8-9 NIV) God's always got your best at heart.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['She poured it on Jesus' feet...' John 12:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>It would be nice to feel that once in a while there'd be a day where you could just cruise along without a care in the world, wouldn't it? But there are days when you feel that all you've got to give God are the tail ends of your time-nothing but the scraps. You know you haven't worshipped God with the best you've got to give.  Let's look at the way Mary worshipped Jesus: 'Mary took...expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped His feet with her hair.'</p>
<p>We see Mary's character in this. Washing Jesus' feet shows how servant-hearted and humble she was. She poured out her expensive perfume on Him. We're not talking dropper quantities here-it was enough to perfume the whole house. She wanted to give the God the best of all she had. </p>
<p>Also remember this took place at a banquet, with lots of people watching. She didn't let other people intimidate and divert her from worshipping Jesus. And the fact she used her hair to wipe Jesus' feet was amazing, as Jewish women rarely let their hair down in public. It shows how personal she was with Jesus and how little she cared about what other people thought. </p>
<p>Let's go all out for God like Mary! Let's seek to please God rather than people. Don't worry what you look like being caught with your Bible! Let yourself be Spirit-guided in a chat about your relationship with God instead! Give God the best. 'It is good to sing praise to our God; it is pleasant and right to praise Him.' (Psalm 147:1 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['All these are the work of...the same Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nothing like a good pick 'n'mix, is there? Coming up with your own yummy blend of choccies and lollies, lovingly arranged to suit your taste buds and yours alone! </p>
<p>God is the perfect pick 'n' mixer. He formed you in your mum's womb with a special blend of gifts, tailored for you and you alone.</p>
<p>God's 'flavour combination' when it comes to you is even more special when we consider how He blended your natural gifts with spiritual ones. The Bible says: 'There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but it is the same Holy Spirit who is the source of them all. It is the one and only Holy Spirit who distributes these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have.' (1 Corinthians 12:4&amp;11 NLT)</p>
<p>You might be thinking, 'Hey what? I haven't a clue what my spiritual gifts are!' Well, the more time you invest with God, the more He will show you. You'll find you notice His Holy Spirit guiding you in specific ways-for instance, you could be minding your own business one minute, and the next feel the Spirit tell you a lady across the road needs prayer for healing. Or you could be having a chat with your mate and suddenly God gives you a word for them. Whatever it is, God's given you the perfect mix for you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let my prayer be...as incense.' Psalm 141:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Noah's ark is a picture of your church. It wasn't a luxury liner... can you imagine spending a year in that ark with all those animals and just one window? No thanks! But Noah had only two options-the stink or the storm. </p>
<p>So what's the point here? That there are no perfect churches. We all love to talk about the power of the New Testament church, but what about its problems? They had hypocrites. They had financial scandals (Acts 5). They had doctrinal differences that almost split the church down the middle (Acts 15). And they had moral problems-they actually had a man in the Corinthian church who was sleeping with his stepmother (1 Corinthians 5). </p>
<p>So what should you do when there's a big stink in your church? First, don't spread it: 'And above all things have fervent love for one another, for love will cover over a multitude of sins.' (1 Peter 4:8 NKJ) Second, work for reconciliation: 'If someone is caught in a sin...restore him gently.' (Galatians 6:1 NIV) Don't be discouraged when 'flesh acts like flesh'. And don't be part of the problem by being immature; instead, be part of the solution. </p>
<p>The Psalmist said, 'Let my prayer be set before You as incense.' When problems arise in your church, you should pray, walk according to God's Word, and trust Him to bring good out of the situation.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The socket of Jacob's thigh was out of joint...' Genesis 32:25 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The Bible isn't full of stories of squeaky clean people with superhero strength and nobility. Nor does it have endless tales of perfect specimens of humanity used to fulfil all of God's purposes on planet Earth. The New Testament doesn't look anything like the adventures of Jesus and the twelve Gummy Bears! </p>
<p>Nope, the Bible is about regular Waynes and Waynettas like you and me. In fact God's preference seems to be to use the least likely people. Throughout Scripture, He seems to be on the look-out for the kind of people considered least worthy by human standards. And guess what? He hasn't changed. </p>
<p>The truth is it's not about us; it's about Him. It's not about what we have done and can do; it's about what God has done and what He can do through us. It can be hard feeling totally out of your depth. Maybe you feel like you're struggling through a situation like Jacob trying to walk with his dodgy hip. </p>
<p>God often uses difficult situations and difficult people to grow us and make us rely on Him. So instead of thinking about how unfair or difficult a situation feels, take the time to consider what God is trying to teach you through it. </p>
<p>Here's some really great news: we don't have to struggle on in our own strength and capabilities. God says, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJ)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Abraham...was called God's friend.' James 2:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Friendships don't seem to work when they're all one-sided. They tend to end in angry words: 'Know what? I'm what's called a giver-you on the other hand just take, take, take!' </p>
<p>God is definitely a giver. He wants to give us more than we could ever dream or imagine. And boy, do we wanna grab hold of those B-for-blessings: 'Thanks very much Lord, don't mind if I do! Yep, God's a great mate!' </p>
<p>But what about when God takes away? What's up with that? We don't wear our God Squad badges with quite such a big smile then, do we? </p>
<p>Let's have a look at God's friend Abraham. God stripped a lot away from him: 'Leave your country, your relatives, and your father's family, and go to the land I will show you.' (Genesis 12:1 NCV) Abraham had to leave everything he knew and loved in order to gain something that he hadn't even seen-and didn't even know if he wanted. </p>
<p>But Abraham knew he could trust God. He knew that God knew him better than anyone and he knew that he would want what God wanted him to have. It's hard to see blessings when God takes things away. It's hard to have faith in the unseen but, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight.' (Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Marriage should be honoured by all.' Hebrews 13:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>If Christianity would just let go of its hang-ups about sex, people wouldn't be so put off the church, right? We've ditched the organ for the electric guitar, so why not click the refresh button on our attitudes to sex too? Why won't the church give us the green light to play around a bit? The answer is God.</p>
<p>Sex and God: the two are connected. God made us and God made sex. And because we are spirit and God is spirit, there is a lot more than just the physical happening in the marriage bed. Something spiritual is going on. And if God carefully designed the act of intimacy, doesn't it follow that He would know when to use it?</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 6:15-16 NLT says, 'Don't you realise that your bodies are actually parts of Christ? Should a man take his body, which belongs to Christ, and join it to a prostitute? Never! And don't you know that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, &quot;The two are united into one.&quot;' Avoiding commitment avoids the beauty of relationships. We miss out on God if we're only interested in what we can <i>get</i> from Him; likewise we miss out on <i>love</i> if we're only interested in flesh on flesh. God draws a firm line on sex outside the commitment of marriage.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['[Your] steps...are ordered by the Lord.' Psalm 37:23 NKJ<br /> <br />The sun is shining, the birds are singing a happy tune and you're feeling tip-top, looking hot and it promises to be a great day. You get to school, college or the office doing your best swagger down the corridor and... Slam! The door crashes right in your face as the person in front glides on through.<br /><br />OK, so that was annoying... but you're in a good mood and you're not gonna let a little door incident steal your joy, right? You carry on and then... Slam! It happens again. You're determined to keep upbeat but you mutter loud enough to be heard and your carefree swagger has morphed into a walk with that 'I'm a bit annoyed with you' edge. You turn the corner, relieved this is the last set of doors before your destination, aaand... SLAM! Farewell joy. <br /><br />Do you ever feel like God is distant? And like that rude dude in front of you, He's not seeing or caring you're there? Do you ever wonder where He is when doors of opportunity slam in your face? Well, 'we can make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps.' (Proverbs 16:9 NLT) It's hard when doors close on us but God wants you to know, 'For I know the plans I have for you...They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.'

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>On an all-day bricklayer's practical test, each student was given a drawing and a labourer who would prepare bricks and mortar for them as they built the item from the drawing supplied. One of the students appeared to know what he was doing. He started well while the others stood around watching.</p>
<p>Once he was well on his way, the other students simply followed his design. (In an open workshop it was impossible to stop anyone from cheating.) After several hours the inspired brickie stopped and looked at his drawing very carefully. Then he folded the drawing and kicked the project down! You could have heard a pin drop. They all needed help now, but no one knew what to do. They all failed.</p>
<p>It's good that life isn't like that. We are not left to our own devices with only each other as inspiration. We can be friends with God Himself and have His inspiration. In John 15: 9-10 GWT, Jesus says, 'I have loved you the same way the Father has loved Me. So live in My love. you obey My commandments, you will live in My love. I have obeyed My Father's commandments, and in that way I live in His love.'</p>
<p>When we are friends of God, we want to obey Him because we know His way is best. Rely on God for your inspiration, follow His way and stay wrapped up in His love.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Friends: we text them, call them, leave silly messages on their Facebook wall, meet up and chat all night, go here there and everywhere. We make time for friends, put the effort in, and we make sure they know they're important to us. What about God? Does He know you're His friend? Do you make sure you spend time with Him, put the effort in getting to know Him? Is God your number one friend?</p>
<p>David desired to know God above all else. He used words like longing, yearning, thirsting and hungering: 'I ask only one thing of the Lord. This is what I want: Let me live in the Lord's house all my life.' (Psalm 27:4 NCV) He even said, 'Your love means more than life to me...' (Psalm 63:3 CEV)</p>
<p>Jacob's desire was so intense that he wrestled with God all night, saying, 'I will not let You go unless You bless me.' (Genesis 32:26 NIV) Paul was another man who was passionate about his friendship with God. 'My determined purpose is that I may...become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him...' (Philippians 3:10 AMP) Can the same be said about you?</p>
<p>Are you willing to say, 'Lord, more than anything else, I want to know You'? God's answer to that prayer has always been: 'You will...find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.' (Jeremiah 29:13-14 NKJ)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why...have You laid the burden...on me?' Numbers 11:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Are you in a Moses Mess? Moses was asked by God to lead the people of Israel but at one point found himself completely overwhelmed-it all got too much for him: 'Why...have You laid the burden of all these people on me?' He couldn't cope and so he blamed God. Recognise that feeling?</p>
<p>But God answers back: 'I didn't, you took it on yourself,' and Moses quickly realises that there were actually plenty of people around to help him-he'd just not bothered to ask. We need to learn from Moses: God wants us to ask for help when we need it too. And not only from Him, but also from those He puts around us too.</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons we don't ask for help: because we want to be independent, we're afraid or we think we're being weak. Instead of the benefits, most of us see only negative consequences to asking for help. But good things are waiting to be had if we get over our fears and ask for the help we need.</p>
<p>Asking for help is a good thing-it's a sign of strength, not of weakness. It gets us the right kind of help at the right time, stops us getting overwhelmed or exhausted, and makes our life easier. It can even make someone else feel good (have you noticed how good you feel when you can help someone who asks for it?)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['No one can serve two masters...' Matthew 6:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Good grief' is an example of an oxymoron, a phrase containing words that contradict each other. Here are some more: Jumbo Shrimp, Numb Feeling, Plastic Glasses, Fresh Frozen, Fine Mess, Working Vacation, Bigger Half, Oddly Appropriate and Clearly Misunderstood.</p>
<p>There are also religious oxymorons like Pure Evil but the most common is 'Lukewarm Christian'. These are two words that just don't go together. </p>
<p>In the book of Revelation 3:16 NIV we read what Jesus said to the church in Laodicea: 'Because you are lukewarm-neither hot nor cold-I am about to spit you out of my mouth.' Jesus also said, 'No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.' (Matthew 6:24 NIV)</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that we have to be perfect before we can call ourselves a Christian (in fact 'perfect Christian' is an oxymoron too!) It just means that when we come to Christ, we must be willing to give Him our whole selves, not just part of ourselves. When Jesus comes into your life He can't become 'just one more thing'. Instead, He wants to take over. As the apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV, 'If anyone is in Christ he is a new creation-the old has gone, the new has come!' Jesus lived to please God, not to impress people, and we need to follow that example.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...win favour and a good name in the sight of God and man.' Proverbs 3:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>You already know that elephants are one of the most powerful land animals in the world. So how do people train them to perform in circuses? </p>
<p>The first rule for training an elephant is making it believe that it can't run away. So elephant trainers will start working with elephants as babies by tying them to heavy-duty steel stakes in the ground. Over and over again, the elephant will try to pull free, but it won't be able to. Having learned that the boundary is solid and immovable the elephant will eventually stop trying to escape. The Bible tells us to, '...win favour and a good name in the sight of God and man.' This means we need to start training ourselves up in our youth and-importantly-we need a 'stake in the ground' to show us where the limits are, the difference between right and wrong for our lives.</p>
<p>That 'stake' is the Word of God. The only way you can become an obedient follower of Jesus is to submit yourself to the authority of the Word of God. If you discipline yourself now you will be able to control yourself when difficult times of temptation come your way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...win favour and a good name in the sight of God and man.' Proverbs 3:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Which are you more bothered about: what your friends think of you, what your family thinks of you, or what God thinks of you?</p>
<p>You probably know what the right answer should be, but is what God thinks about you <i>actually</i> most important to you? When your mates invite you to a drinking session, what do you do? When your boyfriend or girlfriend pressures you to have sex, what do you do? When your family tells you that going to church is for losers, what do you do? Are you saying one thing but doing another?</p>
<p>The Bible says, 'Never let loyalty and kindness get away from you! Wear them like a necklace; write them deep within your heart. Then you will find favour with both God and people, and you will gain a good reputation.' (Proverbs 3: 3-4 NLT) Loyalty and kindness are important character qualities which both involve action as well as attitude. Thoughts and words aren't enough-our lives reveal whether we are truly loyal to God and act in His kindness towards everyone.</p>
<p>In Luke 15, you can read Jesus' story of the prodigal son. The older son appears to have the right attitude, staying home to work with his father. But his actions don't match up. Because when the younger son returns, the older son refuses to forgive him and refuses to celebrate his return with his dad. Make sure your actions measure up to your attitude!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...win favour and a good name in the sight of God and man.' Proverbs 3:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Did you know that God can help you earn a good reputation? Even when people and events are set against you, God can and will come through for you. All you need to do is, 'Never let loyalty and kindness get away from you! Wear them like a necklace; write them deep within your heart. Then you will find favour with both God and people, and you will gain a good reputation.' (Proverbs 3: 3-4 NLT)</p>
<p>Imagine a guy who gets beaten within an inch of his life by his brothers. They then decide to earn a few bucks selling him as a slave. Just when he thinks he's doing ok again, he's wrongly accused of rape and gets thrown into prison. You can't exactly see him becoming the next Prime Minister, can you?</p>
<p>But when God is writing your story anything is possible. The story above is exactly what happened to Joseph. His reputation is in tatters but God totally turns things around. God brings a butler into Joseph's life and as a result of helping him, Joseph is released from prison to help Pharaoh understand his crazy dreams. Joseph ends up as Pharaoh's right hand man, ruling all of Egypt. Talk about building a reputation up from nothing!</p>
<p>Keep your mind open and stay sensitive to God, for He will give you favour in the most unusual places and through the most unlikely people.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus said...Get up!' John 5:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus met a man who'd been unable to walk for 38 years, because he thought there was nothing he could do about it: 'Jesus said, Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.' </p>
<p>How do you see yourself? As a helpless victim? Wendy Blight says, 'I lived like that...for a decade. At 21 I was raped by a masked stranger hiding in my apartment. Before that I loved life. I'd just completed college...graduated with honours...become engaged to a wonderful man...and had an amazing job waiting for me... My attacker's...act shattered my hopes and dreams. I lived in a prison of fear and despair. Then I encountered Christ...the words He spoke...pierced my soul. I...was the man on that mat...accustomed to my place of sorrow... I enjoyed being the victim... I was comfortable. The Bible says, The Word of God is living and active...it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart (Hebrews 4:12 NIV) and it spoke personally to me. I knew I needed to take the first step. I surrendered my fear, pity, and grief... I learned God had a plan for my life and a purpose for my pain. However, I'd never see it until I had the courage to get up and walk. If you're on the mat...open God's Word. Let Him speak...promises of hope and healing. Before you can get off the mat, you must surrender your fear, self-pity, and despair. Will you do it?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Gideon...crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit.' Judges 8:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Are you thinking of quitting? Thinking of giving up? You were doing ok, you believed you could make a difference, believed you could do it...until they poured criticism and cold water on you, laughed at you and knocked you down. </p>
<p>We all have times when we feel like throwing in the towel. When Gideon fought the Midianites we read that he 'came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit.' He was completely done in, but Gideon kept on going, refusing to let the river intimidate him, or tiredness stop him. So God gave him a great victory! God can do the same for you.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4 NLT, Paul reminds us we may think we are at the end of the rope, but we are never at the end of hope: 'We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed and broken. We are perplexed, but we don't give up and quit. We are hunted down, but God never abandons us. We get knocked down, but we get up again and keep going ...our present troubles are quite small and won't last very long. Yet they produce for us an immeasurably great glory that will last forever! So we don't look at the troubles we can see right now; rather, we look forward to what we have not yet seen. For the troubles we see will soon be over, but the joys to come will last forever.' (vv.7-9, 16-18)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord your God is among you, and He is a great and awesome God.' Deuteronomy 7:21 NLT<br /><br /><p>In his book, <i>Living the Good Life</i>, John Ortberg writes: 'A friend and I were going to spend two weeks preaching in Ethiopia when it was still under Marxist rule. The underground churches there asked if I would bring 50 study Bibles. I had reservations about smuggling Bibles, but we decided to give it a shot. Sure enough, the customs agent opened the suitcases and confiscated the Bibles. A few days later we received a call that the head customs official wanted an interview with the leaders of the churches. We feared the worst-church leaders in Ethiopia spent so much time in prison, they referred to it as 'The University'. (This is where God would send His leaders when He really wanted them to grow. Like the Biblical Joseph, some of them would actually be put in charge by the guards, when the guards wanted to go on break. They would take the bullets out of their rifles and hand them to the Christian prisoners to stand watch until they got back!) Imagine our surprise when the official said, 'These Bibles are illegal. You may keep them on one condition-you must tell no one. I want one for myself.' Ortberg says, 'That day my God got a little larger!'</p>
<p>Every time you step out in faith, you see that God is bigger than you thought and you realise the truth of Paul's words: '...His power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine...' (Ephesians 3:20 CEV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the way...the truth and the life...' John 14:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Why do we pretend we have all the answers when we don't? When Paul wrote, '...we know in part...' (1 Corinthians 13:9 NIV) he wasn't having a crisis of faith. He was just being honest. It's as if some things in life are labelled by God just like products in a supermarket-with an 'EXPLAIN BY' date. Thomas may not have arrived at the truth of the resurrection when the others did; but he got it soon enough!</p>
<p>A Christian broadcaster said: 'I find airtight conclusions mainly in people who have not hurt much. They're usually people who have become tightly wired, rigid and isolated from the real world. They're closed...unwilling to be vulnerable. Suddenly a divorce comes. Or someone dies in a tragic set of circumstances or loses his job. Reality hits and a storm blows in that threatens their once tranquil existence. Their emotional explosion results in more questions than answers. They discover things they didn't really know. They are in the vortex of dilemmas they cannot solve. At that point simplistic solutions are replaced with realistic reflections, and the deep things of God begin to emerge, eclipsing shallow answers.' That explains why Jesus didn't have a go at Thomas and say, 'Are you just going to diss me to my face by saying I'm a ghost?' No, Jesus didn't push Thomas away because of his doubts, He called him closer, close enough to touch Him. Thomas knew stuff in his head, Jesus had said to him earlier, 'I am the way and the truth and the life' but it had not entered his heart. However, when Jesus appeared to him, that changed. Jesus knew the EXPLAIN BY date for Thomas and He knows it for you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I'm not trying to be a people pleaser...I am trying to please God...' Galatians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>A talented young musician studied under a famous violin teacher. Now it was time for his first public performance. He played amazingly and a huge chorus of 'Bravos!' came from the audience. Strangely he seemed not to hear them, but kept glancing nervously at the front row. It wasn't until a white-haired man stood up and nodded graciously, that the young violinist started to smile. His master had praised his work! He'd received the only approval that mattered.</p>
<p>Whose approval do you look for? Be honest! It's important to get real about how much of what you do is just to win the favour of other people. Paul said, '...we speak as messengers...approved by God... Our purpose is to please God, not people.' (1 Thessalonians 2:4 NLT) He also said, '...I'm not trying to be a people pleaser...If I were...I would not be Christ's servant.' (Galatians 1:10 NLT) You really need to watch out for the people-pleaser trap. Don't be like the people in the Bible who '...loved human praise more than the praise of God.' (John 12:43 NLT)</p>
<p>Remember, any time you set new goals, establish new boundaries, or change old patterns, you're going to get flak from people who are used to you behaving in a certain way. Have the courage of your convictions. Don't stop doing what you know is right!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This is the day the Lord has made...' Psalm 118:24 NKJ<br /><br /><p>What's your diet like? Do you look after yourself by eating regular, healthy meals? Or do you pig out on junk food most days? Imagine if, when you went to have your tea tonight, you were told, 'This is your last meal for a week!' How would you feel? Would it make you stuff your face, trying to eat as much as you could in the hope you'll last the week? Would you start feeling hungry as soon as you finished because you know you can't have any more food for six more days? You'd begin by feeling bloated, followed by a blinding headache and by mid-week, hunger pains would start, lasting through to your next meal. No one would choose to live on one meal a week-it's ludicrous. We'd become ill and weak, unable to concentrate.</p>
<p>Did you ever stop and think that what you would never tolerate for your body is often the 'standard fare' for your spirit? A Sunday 'feast' of Bible study, prayer and worship followed by six days of 'famine'. Psalm 118 says, 'This is the day the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.' That means every day we're meant to be praising God, thanking Him-after all it's only because of His great power that this day is here at all.</p>
<p>Check up on your own spiritual diet! Is it properly balanced, with proper amounts of prayer, praise and Bible study every day?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve the Lord with gladness...' Psalm 100:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'I can't do anything'; 'I'm rubbish'; 'I'm useless'; 'I've messed up big time.' The Bible may tell us to serve the Lord with gladness but how can we do that if we think we're useless, rubbish, can't do anything, or just too bad?</p>
<p>It's easy to compare ourselves to other people and think we're not good enough to serve God. But think again. The Bible is full of people God chose to use who weren't exactly perfect: Moses stuttered, David's armour didn't fit him, John Mark was undependable, Jacob was a liar, Abraham was too old, Joseph was a nuisance, Peter was a coward, Jonah was disobedient, Jeremiah was suicidal, Elijah suffered from depression, Moses and David committed murder, Zacchaeus was very short, Timothy had ulcers, Lazarus was dead, Miriam was a gossip, Gideon and Thomas were doubters, John the Baptist dressed funny, Mary, Daniel and so many others were only teenagers...</p>
<p>God doesn't do job interviews or background checks or ask for references. He doesn't care what your qualifications are-He chooses to use you, just as you are.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission, said, 'I used to ask God to help me. Then I asked if I might help Him. Finally I ended up asking Him to do His work through me.' When you come to believe, <i>really</i> believe, that serving is all about God working through you, you'll be able to 'serve the Lord with gladness' everywhere and anywhere.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Peter...walked on the water toward Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NLT<br /><br /><p>When things get tough how do you cope? When you get scared, worried or stressed, what or who do you turn to for help? We all develop coping mechanisms when life becomes difficult-some of them helpful, some of them not. Sometimes we can use unhealthy or dangerous coping mechanisms like drugs or alcohol, even eating disorders or self-harming.</p>
<p>It must have been so exciting being a disciple of Jesus-no two days the same, impossible to second-guess Jesus; every moment wondering what He was going to say or do next. But all the disciples found that even when hanging out with Jesus 24/7 there were still times when life got a bit scary and stressful.</p>
<p>One time in particular lets us in on the best coping mechanism of all, one we all need to use, one that will never harm us. The disciples were in a boat, awake because they 'were in trouble... a strong wind had risen and they were fighting heavy waves.' (Matthew 14:24 NLT) Then, out of the darkness, appeared Jesus walking on the water. They all freaked out, thinking He was a ghost! 'But Jesus was quick to comfort them: 'It's all right...I am here. Don't be afraid.' (v27) In this scary, stressy situation all but one disciple chose to stay in the boat. The boat was their coping mechanism. They felt safer there. But 'Peter...walked on the water toward Jesus.' (v29) He knew when life gets scary, tough and stressy, the best thing to do is walk toward Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Peter...walked on the water toward Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NLT<br /><br /><p>Perhaps you've been there-you're in church, the music's pumpin', the rooms rockin', God's presence is electric and you're up for doing anything and everything God asks. You feel God's power inside you-nothing is going to stop you now! But then, moments later, you feel helpless, alone, powerless. You're surrounded by temptation again, doubts creep in and you want to give in or give up.</p>
<p>Peter felt exactly the same way. At three o'clock in the morning on a choppy sea he was totally trusting Jesus, and when Jesus asks Him to walk on water-he does! Moments later though, he's lost the plot. He starts to look at the water and the waves and doubts started creeping in: <i>What do you think you're doing? You can't do that, you can't walk on water, no one can! Look at the size of those waves-they're going to swallow you up!</i></p>
<p>One minute Peter was doing incredible super-hero stuff; the next he was literally drowning, fighting for his life: 'But when he looked around at the high waves, he was terrified and began to sink. Save me, Lord! he shouted.' (Matthew 14:30 NLT) Did Jesus laugh at him, punish him or get angry with him for messing up? No! 'Jesus reached out His hand and grabbed him.' (v31) Did you get that? <i>Instantly!</i> Straight away, Jesus helped him back on his feet when he cried for help-and He will do the same for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Peter...walked on the water toward Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NLT<br /><br /><p>Imagine you're one of the disciples who stayed in the boat and watched Peter walk on the water to Jesus. Then you saw him sink. Would you be laughing at him, shouting 'loser'? Or would you be thinking, 'Did you see that? He just walked on water!' When Jesus helped Peter back in the boat, would you get stuck into him for failing? Or would you be asking, 'What did it feel like to walk on water?' Ok, you could say Peter failed-after all he didn't succeed in what he set out to do because he dropped out half-way and sank! But for a short time, Peter walked on water. He may have crashed and burned publicly, but he experienced the euphoria of walking on water.</p>
<p>He alone knew how it felt to be empowered by God to do what he could never have done by himself. Once you've walked on water you are never the same. So surely the only way Peter could have really failed is if he'd never tried at all?</p>
<p>Winston Churchill said, 'I've never failed at anything in my life. I was simply given another opportunity to get it right.' That's the winning spirit! Just because you sink doesn't mean you're sunk. Failure doesn't come from sinking-it comes when you stop trying. No one gets it right first time every time. So when things go wrong, know you've just been given another chance to get it right-keep on going and you will succeed.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Peter...walked on the water toward Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NLT<br /><br /><p>How boring would it be to go to Dreamworld and not go on any of the rollercoasters? The whole point of going is to scare yourself senseless on the excited thrill of the rides! You might have to stand in a queue for hours before climbing aboard the ride of a lifetime, but aren't you buzzin' when it's all over? You start out clinging on for dear life but then you get such a rush you want to go again. It's not long before you're riding the coaster arms in the air to get that extra buzz!</p>
<p>Peter's boat on Lake Galilee was the theme park; the water the ride. He had to get out of the boat and step on to the water to experience the thrill of doing the impossible with God. It was a daring act. It took guts, trust, faith.</p>
<p>Jesus is inviting you to go on the adventure of a lifetime. What will you choose-the water, or the boat? Are you going to play it safe and fit in with everyone else or are you going to step out in faith, ride the waves, and be an extreme disciple of Jesus? We only get one life. Let's live it like Peter with an enormous spirit of adventure and risk and let's see God do the impossible with us. Jesus says, 'What is impossible with men is possible with God.' (Luke 18:27 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' Luke 5:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about getting serious with God, you can almost guarantee one of the battles you'll face is with <i>hurry</i>. In the world where we live you tend to find two types of people: those who can be bothered, and those who can't. Those who can't suffer from what's called apathy and those who can are usually so focussed on fighting apathy that everything has to be done at warp speed. While this super-sonic way of living starts to get the job done, the pit-falls are normally as follows: (a) you get worn out (b) you get frustrated at what seems like apathy from anyone going slower than you (c) you become so focussed on getting the job done you actually forget to have a relationship with God!</p>
<p>Nobody was in more demand than Jesus but He always knew that there was a time for hurry and a time for rest. Have you ever noticed that despite living a hectic lifestyle Jesus never got stressed out? In those three years he never even felt the need for a little holiday!</p>
<p>The truth is, as much as we complain about it, we love hurry. It keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes us feel important. Jesus never hurried. He had time for people, his diary was flexible. Nothing was so important that he couldn't change his plans for someone. And what's the secret? Solitude. Jesus took time out, away from busyness to be with His Father. Make sure booking time-out for God has the highest priority in your diary this week.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you...' Deuteronomy 31:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Surely God would only send those He could trust into enemy territory. Understand this: God cares about where you are. He has selected you for your school, college or work environment. He has already equipped you, or is currently doing so. Your parents wouldn't send you off on a school camp without giving you what you would need while you're away. And God wouldn't either. Sometimes nasty environments can be overwhelming; but by God's grace we can thrive in them! If you'll take God with you and keep your identity in one piece, the enemy will lose ground. Don't let him keep you focused on everything that will do your head in: gossip, peer pressure, being bullied, friends falling out, mountains of homework or nasty people. The danger is that you'll focus on the discomfort of the moment and miss the blessings that lie beyond it. While you're praying for God to change your circumstances and take away your problems, He's saying, 'If only you knew what was waiting for you. Your purpose and destiny are only moments away, and, though not wrapped in shiny paper, they contain all you'll ever need to reach your goal and bring Me glory.' God understands us so well. He knows all about our desire to stay in one place when things become so comfortable, that we just don't want to move! Often He has to trouble the waters so that we'll reach out to Him in desperation, and as a result, tap into strength and success we never knew possible.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.' Mark 6:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>The shops are full of Halloween masks, costumes, blood and other 'fun' items for little kids. Some Christians will be having meetings to declare 'victory over the darkness' and others will be taking their kids out 'trick or treating'. Whatever you think about Halloween there is no question that it's a night of celebration for Satan and, 'fun' as it may be, it is a very important night for those involved with witchcraft and the occult.</p>
<p>Halloween is not a night to be feared as many Christians do, but how about seeing it as a wonderful opportunity to introduce people to Jesus? It's one night of the year that everyone wants to believe in the supernatural so rather than rant about Scream masks and slam the door in little children's faces, let's show them the power we have! How about door knocking and asking if they would like prayer for something instead of trick or treating? How about a party to celebrate Jesus, dress the kids as angels and things from the Bible (Jesus, an ark, a whale, a dove, a fish etc!)? Let's not teach people what we're against but show them what we have-a magnificent, glorious and beautiful God who has totally beaten Satan already! Harry Potter may be able to manage a few magic tricks but our God can heal the sick, cast out demons, raise the dead to life, give us eternal life AND He's not a made-up character from a fantasy book-He's alive and with us right now!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...closed her womb.' 1 Samuel 1:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Poor Hannah-her medical records are known to billions of people throughout history. Her story of not being able to conceive is there for all to read in the book of 1 Samuel. More than anything, this God-fearing woman wanted a child, but the story says: 'The Lord...closed her womb.' We get the sense that Hannah would have made the best, most devoted mother going-so why didn't God give her the desire of her heart? Well, because Hannah wanted a son but God wanted a prophet.</p>
<p>It's almost as if God used Hannah's desperation in order to get her attention and draw her closer into His plans. Through those tough times, Hannah found herself uttering words that locked into God's will: 'If You...give me a son, I will give him back to You all his life.' (1 Samuel 1:11 NCV) By surrendering her greatest desire to God, a whole chain of blessings began to open up. Yes, Hannah got her son, and six more children too (1 Samuel 2:5). And the nation got one of its greatest prophets.</p>
<p>Often the picture is so much bigger than us. Is your heart longing for something or someone but the door seems tightly shut? You have two choices: (1) Allow your frustration to drive you away from God; or (2) Allow your situation to draw you closer to God. Which will it be?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.' 1 Peter 4:9 NKJ <br /><br /><p>Mother Teresa of Calcutta said this: 'I think the world today is upside down and is suffering so much because there is so very little love in the homes and in family life. We have no time for our children, we have no time for each other; there is no time to enjoy each other...Love begins at home; love lives in homes, and that is why there is so much unhappiness in the world today. If we listen to Jesus He will tell us what He said before: &quot;Love one another, as I have loved you.&quot;...If we are to bring that love into life again, we have to begin at home.'</p>
<p>If we don't have time for the people God has chosen to be closest to us, we'll never have time for strangers. And that is where we should be heading in our journey: 'Be hospitable...with brotherly affection for...unknown guests...foreigners, the poor, and all others.' (1 Peter 4:9 AMP)</p>
<p>If we treat our own mum like an unknown guest in our lives, what hope is there for the poor? Let's put the world the right side up, starting in our own homes. Pray for opportunities to serve your parents. Ask God to help you see your annoying little brother through His eyes. Go out on a limb to make your sister's friends welcome. Imagine everyone that steps foot in your house is Jesus and seek to make Him feel at home.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Marriage should be honoured by all.' Hebrews 13:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ok, let's run down the list. The invitations, seating plan, dress, shoes, flowers, photographer, venue, menu, cake, rings, bridesmaid, best man, minister...and that's even before we given any thought to the honeymoon! Weddings can be so complex, it's no wonder some of us need wedding planners to ensure the 'perfect' day. If only as much thought went into the marriage as the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>There are more than 500 references to marriage in the Bible; clearly God thinks we need to treat the subject with a great deal of respect. There aren't too many articles in the Old Testament about choosing the right song for your first dance, or whether your napkins should match the colour of your bridesmaids' outfits. The Bible focuses on the theme of relationships. The Christian story is all about God winning back the relationship His people whipped away from Him. It's all about God restoring our messed-up relationships with each other. Fine-tuning our thoughts on marriage fine-tunes our thoughts on God. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Marriage should be honoured by all.' Hebrews 13:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>OK, so your mates file Christian teaching on marriage somewhere in between mum's easy listening CD and dad's cardigan collection: boring and outdated. The idea of <i>not</i> sleeping with someone until public vows have been made before God seems straight out of the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>But the Bible is big on relationships. It teaches that there is more to intimacy than gooey feelings, pretty people and happy times. The core of love is commitment. Gooey feelings and good times were not enough to lead Jesus to the cross. Commitment paved the way for Calvary. God was so committed to restoring our relationships He poured himself out to death, even death on a cross, in order to win us back. A ring on the finger gives us a physical reminder that we are committed to this person in a special way.</p>
<p>Beautiful skin shrivels to wrinkles. Fluttering butterflies in the tummy fly away in the grind of everyday life. That ever-dependable spouse will hurt you at some point. But love remains committed even when you're not 'feeling it'. Paul's letter to Titus groups the word <i>love</i> with <i>respect</i>, <i>self</i><i>-</i><i>control</i>, <i>faith</i> and <i>endurance</i>. Not a mention of whether someone sets your pulse racing. Love doesn't pack its suitcase when the birds aren't singing; love chooses to keep committed till the very end.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Marriage should be honoured by all.' Hebrews 13:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you think marriage looks more like a field of battle than a bed of roses, then you're not far from the truth. Even Jesus spells out the 'rough' over the 'romance'. So did Paul. Listen: '...those who marry will have trouble in this life...' (1 Corinthians 7:28 NCV) </p>
<p>Yet marriage is also an opportunity to learn about love and grace. Its lessons in loving others are about growing as a God-loving person.</p>
<p>See, no matter what your relationship status on Facebook says, you are still called to give out love to everyone. 1 Peter 4:8 GWT says, 'Above all, love each other warmly, because love covers many sins.'</p>
<p>When two people live together, they're face to face with all the peculiarities and downright unlovable stuff about each other. Without a large dose of grace and a quickness of apology the two will end up throwing kitchen appliances at one another. Love always looks for the best even when the best seems to have gone AWOL. Inspired by God's love for us we too should look for the best in others. All relationships have the capacity for love, hate, excitement, disappointment, passion, boredom, healing, hurt, selfishness, selflessness. The largeness of love asks you to look for the best-always.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened...as examples...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The politician caught taking 'gifts' from business colleagues... The trader giving his friends insider tips... Life has a funny way of highlighting hypocrisy, doesn't it? Even the greatest heroes of the Bible had their 'caught with their hands in the till' moments.</p>
<p>Abraham, the 'friend of God', lied about Sarah being his wife. (Genesis 12:10-20) Moses, the mighty leader, got angry and disobeyed God. David, a man after God's heart, committed adultery and then tried to cover his tracks with murder. (2 Samuel 11:15) Peter, leader in the church, denied Jesus not once, but three times (Luke 22:54-62), and John Mark gave up and went home during a missionary trip. (Acts 15:38) They're all in there, warts and all, and as Paul says, '...you, too, may fall into the same sin.' (1 Corinthians 10:12 NLT)</p>
<p>So don't get discouraged when you stumble. Admit your mistake, apologise to the people involved, ask God for forgiveness, forgive yourself, learn from what happened, and move on. Abraham cleaned his slate with all parties and ended up with descendants more numerous than the sands. David repented and is remembered as Israel's greatest king. John Mark is believed to be the writer behind one of only four completely trusted accounts about Jesus: Mark's Gospel. Tripping up doesn't have to stop you from running all-out for Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are the salt of the earth.' Matthew 5:13 AMP<br /><br /><p>You know those chips where you add your own salt? Well have you ever tried munching <i>before</i> shaking the little sachet? They taste a bit bland and dull, don't they? It's the shake of the salt which kicks your taste-buds into party mode. As friends of Jesus, we're asked to shake our salt to kick life into the world. Jesus said, 'You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste...it is not good for anything but to be thrown out.'</p>
<p>It's the strength and quality of salt which brings the flavour out of food. If we're going to flavour this tired, dull life we need the strength and qualities of God: 'the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.' (Galatians 5:22-23 NIV)</p>
<p>So when you choose to love, you're shaking your salt. When you choose to wear a smile despite the tough stuff you're facing, you're shaking your salt. When you choose not to rise to Mr. Angry's threats, you're shaking your salt. When you choose to be patient with that doddering old ditherer at the bus-stop... well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Love for God is the root; love for others is the fruit. We've all met religious types who can quote whole passages of the Bible, but are sadly lacking in love. They leave a taste like dud salt, only good for throwing out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['On the left hand...I cannot see Him.' Job 23:9 AMP<br /><br /><p>OK, so your right foot can thunder a ball between the goalposts from fifty metres out, but chances are, your left foot couldn't even drop a clanger into the crowd. The best wingers are trained to play on either flank in order to surprise their opponents. And God? Well, He's the best two-footed winger around. God never fails to surprise us when He switches from flank to flank.</p>
<p>Genesis 28 tells the story of God switching flank on Jacob. You see, Jacob was sent away from home to find a wife. God showed up on the journey and revealed there was more at stake than spotting the future Mrs Jacob. Through a dream, Jacob was shown his part in the Bible's big picture.</p>
<p>With God, you can try to second-guess what flank He's on, but it's likely He'll be coming at you from another direction entirely.</p>
<p>Sometimes not knowing how God is going to show up can leave us feeling deserted. During his darkest hours, Job said, 'I go forward...but He is not there; I go backward...but I cannot perceive Him; on the left hand...where He works...I cannot see Him.' (Job 23:8-9 AMP)</p>
<p>Seeing God move in our lives reassures us in our faith, but when He's switched flanks on us, we need not worry that He's forgotten us-we can trust He's working us into the bigger picture.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus...have been a wonderful encouragement to me.' 1 Corinthians 16:17-18 TLB<br /><br /><p>Read today's verse again. Stephanas who? Fortunatus what? And as for the third bloke-how do you even pronounce his name? We know little about them and yet here they are in the cast list of the biggest-selling book of all time. Most encouragers don't want to be the centre of attention: they're happy playing Mr and Mrs Anonymous. Still this otherwise unknown trio played their role in spurring Paul on in his mission.</p>
<p>Want to be a Stephanas? Someone whose words are like energy food to others' souls? The flipside of encouragement is discouragement. Paul warns us to wash our mouths out of discouragement: 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up...that it may benefit those who listen.' (Ephesians 4:29 NIV)</p>
<p>A word is a weapon. Used carelessly, it can cut deep scars into people's self esteem. Used expertly, it can sharpen the edges of someone's character. A snide remark may get a quick laugh, but it may leave its mark on someone's make-up for a lifetime. Put a mudguard around your mouth and protect those nearest to you from getting a splatter of your muck. Choose words that will encourage slackers and put the exhausted back on their feet. Just as God injects us with confidence, boost others with the same.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be...doers of the word, and not hearers only...' James 1:22 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Don't think your Geography teacher could teach what he teaches if he believed the world is flat. Or that Muhammad Ali was able to throw a left jab without pounding a lot of punch-bags first. Similarly, you can't really claim to be on first name terms with God if you never do what He says. Your teacher knows what he believes before he opens his mouth. Ali put in the practice before he went toe to toe with the world's best fighters. So should you.</p>
<p>Know what you believe. Get familiar with God and His Word before you talk to others. Then practice what it says before trying to take on the whole world in a fight. If your Bible says, 'Father, hallowed be Your name, Your Kingdom come' (Luke 11:2 NIV), then start practicing it. Start praying like God is someone hallowed, holy and sacred-not your own personal vending machine! Start living like 'Your Kingdom come' means something to you. Letting God have first dibs on your choices allows His Kingdom to come (and not <i>your</i> will be done). If you really believe Jesus meant, 'Give us each day our daily bread,' (Luke 11:3) stop asking for the lifetime loaf. Winning the lottery won't make you happier; chances are it will drive you further from God. So be thankful that God gives you what you need when you need it.</p>
<p>The Bible: don't just read it-live it!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['That you may be...fully developed...' James 1:4 AMP<br /><br /><p>Paul kicks off the book of 2 Corinthians with some advice on how to survive life's struggles. The reason his words carry so much weight is because Paul has been there himself. He's not writing this book from the poolside of his holiday home on the Gold Coast, he wrote it from the heat of frontline mission. He faced the missiles from the crowd, saliva in the face, beatings to his body, the lock and key of jails, hostility, suspicion, the lot. Here's a man with a PhD in suffering for the Gospel. So when he advices us to set our hope on God, we know this isn't some sort of fluffy 'warm fuzzy' encouragement, this is advice learned in the pit of suffering itself.</p>
<p>One of the blessings God can pull out of our suffering is that our troubles qualify us to <i>help others</i> facing the same: 'He comforts us every time we have trouble, so when others have trouble, we can comfort them with the same comfort God gives us.' (2 Corinthians 1:4 NCV)</p>
<p>Another blessing pulled out of suffering is that we always find God right in the heart of it. Anything that turns us to God has to be an asset, not a liability. It's when we lose a friend, our health or find ourselves stuck in the desert that we hear God's whisper calling across the wilderness. Hard times help us develop a fine ear for God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Watch out that no [bitter] root...grows up [among] you.' Hebrews 12:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Remember that bit of childhood wisdom, 'never play with matches'? Only when you clutched that short burnt stick next to a towering inferno could you clearly see why. Bitterness is like that tiny matchstick. The smallest hint of it has the potential to spark a wildfire throughout your life. So how do you throw the water on bitterness before you go up in the flames? </p>
<p>First, forgive. Forgiveness isn't based on an emotion. Don't wait until you 'feel' like it; decide today to free yourself of the crime. When you forgive you open the door for God to heal you. Jesus said, 'Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.' (Matthew 5:7 NIV) Since you yourself will always need to make withdrawals, God calls you to keep making 'mercy deposits'.</p>
<p>Secondly, pray about it. The moment you sense resentment, turn to God and He will give you the strength to act in love rather than react in anger. When you commit to living this way He promises to give you 'power to keep [yourself] calm in the days of adversity.' (Psalm 94:13 AMP)</p>
<p>Thirdly, think Scripturally. Look up every verse you can find on showing forgiveness and meditate on them. Remember, each time you choose to do the right thing, a little more of the 'old you' dies, and the 'new you' develops. Call 000 on bitterness before you end up badly burned.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Every high priest is selected from among men.' Hebrews 5:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>A military man wears a combat uniform, designed to shield him from danger. An American footballer is kitted out in protective padding to safeguard him from numerous blows. But what sort of defensive gear does the average minister wear in the spiritual battle?</p>
<p>Your minister or pastor or youth-leader faces the same trials and temptations as you.</p>
<p>Often the reason they can talk about the tough stuff from the front is because they have faced that tough stuff in their lives. Your church leaders have scars and scrapes from life which you can learn from. Don't think just because they look like they have God on speed-dial, that they don't struggle with thoughts, doubts and failures.</p>
<p>So instead of writing them off as people you can't relate to, listen and learn. In fact, instead of jumping straight on what they are and what they're not, hold that critical tongue, and let rip with some serious prayer for them. Your leaders didn't choose this job-God chose them (and you don't want to be caught badmouthing God's choices, right?) So bless your pastor with a kind word, a 'thank you' card and a prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is the sound...of rain.' 1 Kings 18:41 NKJ<br /><br /><p>So is it going to be sunglasses today or is it going to be umbrella time? The weathermen say one thing, the weather itself says another.</p>
<p>Sometimes when life's getting too hot we need to shut out the weather reports and focus on God-like Elijah did. First, he's part of an impressive 'calling fire down from Heaven' miracle. Then, right after a starring role in the supernatural event of the year, Elijah was plonked straight into a famine. Every bit of human resource had dried up. So what does he do? 'He bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees.' (1 Kings 18:42 NKJ)</p>
<p>Good move. Elijah shuts out his surroundings, focuses on God, and keeps praying for an answer. The answer comes as 'a sound of abundance of rain'. There's that contrasting weather report again: Elijah sees famine and dry land, but his spirit senses rain. Even before a drop falls, Elijah senses the solution to drought-a downpour of rain.</p>
<p>There's an important lesson here. When God speaks to your spirit He may go against what circumstances and situations are saying. Your age may be saying, 'you're too young', your bank might be saying, 'you haven't got enough money', your mates might laugh, 'as if!' But if God is asking you to do something, follow Elijah's example-shut out the world and focus on God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go up now, look toward the sea.' 1 Kings 18:43 NKJ<br /><br /><p>So here's our prophet, head between his knees, silencing out the world's noise, tuning his thoughts to God FM. And yet there's no sign whatsoever of the rain God promised to end the drought. Six times a rain-spotter is sent on the hunt for a raindrop, and yet six times the rain-spotter comes back dry as a bone. Did Elijah hold his hands up and say, 'Maybe I got my forecast a little confused?' No way. He kept believing, shutting out all the signs and circumstances and holding tightly to God's promiseBy the seventh trip to the seaside, the rain-spotter reports seeing a cloud the size of a small fist. Well, a 15 centimetre cloud is hardly going to rain down the heavens. Yet Elijah took this as a sign for action, basically telling people to prepare for the downpour. We desperately need Elijah-sized faith. Faith which is not disheartened by what we hear or see, but chooses to wear God-goggles throughout the dry times.</p>
<p>Notice that Elijah was getting the same old negative reports: 'Not a drop of rain, mate,' 'Not a cloud in the sky, the sun is shimmering off the sea, Granddad.' But Elijah wasn't influenced by the doom and gloom reports; and nor should we be. The newspapers tell us the world's sick, that we live in a moral drought. But we know we're just getting ready for God's reign.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a cloud, as small as a man's hand, rising...' 1 Kings 18:44 NKJ<br /><br /><p>After a long season of drought, God promises Elijah rain. Just before the downpour, there are no looming angry clouds, no ferocious thunder or violent lightning. There's just the smallest, least significant vapour of a cloud-the size of a man's fist.</p>
<p>With God, everything big starts with something small. In fact, if you're not willing to start small, you can't start at all. The servant who kept telling Elijah nothing was happening, finally saw something. It was just a tiny cloud, but it had great potential. God loves to use things we think are insignificant. He used a kid's lunch-box to feed thousands, a catapult to bring down a giant, and a handful of clay to restore a blind man's sight.</p>
<p>He can choose to bless a little job, a little money or a little idea. So little clouds can be indicators of what's coming-when God promises you something, He doesn't need anything big to make it happen. He doesn't look for the brightest idea or the most gifted person to change the world; God looks for someone with a thirst for Him. 'For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.' (2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV) </p>
<p>Whether it's an Esther or a Paul or a Mother Teresa, a Billy Graham or little old you, God needs only one small committed heart to do massive things.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Father seeks...worshippers.' John 4:23 NAS<br /><br /><p>It's easier to throw your arms up and abandon your heart to God if the guitar player is in tune and the singer's voice can melt butter, right? Actually, worshipping God doesn't have to involve music at all. So when we catch ourselves thinking 'this song doesn't really do it for me' or 'I'm not really feeling it today' or 'I'm not getting anything out of worship,' we need an urgent rethink.</p>
<p>Paul reminds us what real worship sounds like: '...offer your lives as a living sacrifice... Your offering must be only for God and pleasing to Him, which is the spiritual way for you to worship.' (Romans 12:1 NCV)</p>
<p>When you fall in love with someone, you probably don't treat life like a musical, breaking out into song about your beloved every two minutes. You love someone by spending quality time together, by taking an interest, by sharing secrets, desires, ups and downs, right? Falling in love with God is the same; with the added extra of being assured that God will never do the dirty on you. Worshipping is about giving your heart over to God.</p>
<p>So if a certain song helps lead you into the presence of God, great. But don't leave your heart strapped to a guitar fret board; work the song into your life. Make your own sweet music through your everyday, ordinary life. Make worship a lifestyle; not a track on your iPod.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will walk at liberty and at ease...' Psalm 119:45 AMP<br /><br /><p>Maths! What a brain-melter! You think you're just getting the hang of trigonometry, when along comes Pythagoras wearing a smug grin. Sometimes life seems like a never-ending maths textbook: you solve one problem when along comes a newer, meatier one. Only life won't allow you a sneak peek at the answers at the back of the book. Unless, of course, the textbook is the Bible.</p>
<p>Jesus said, 'These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' (John 16:33 NKJ) The world promises trouble, but Jesus promises peace: '...learn from Me, because I am gentle and humble. Then you will find rest for yourselves.' (Matthew 11:29 GWT)</p>
<p>How did Jesus manage to keep His cool during the stresses and strains of His hectic life? Crowds draining Him, opposition accusing Him, disciples thirsty for Him; and not once did Jesus pull a sickie. How? Well Jesus lived as much in solitude as He did in the limelight: 'Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where He prayed.' (Mark 1:35 NIV) Spending alone time with God is your essential prescription against stress. Spend double the time with God you'd normally spend stressing and you'll learn to live lightly. That's the kind of maths that does you good.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are not wrestling with flesh and blood...' Ephesians 6:12 AMP<br /><br /><p>Now it's true that some people use Satan as a kind of 'Get out of jail free' card for their own stupid mistakes. They blame their own lapse in morals on a 'spiritual attack' rather than take responsibility for what's happened. However we should not downplay the fact that there is definitely a 'dark pull' in this world.</p>
<p>When Jesus speaks of fulfilling God's plan on the cross, Peter succumbs to the 'dark pull' and rebukes Him. Jesus sharply replies, 'Get behind Me, Satan! You are in My way...' (Matthew 16:23 AMP) Jesus isn't dissing Peter; he's addressing the real source of the problem. It's almost as if Jesus looks straight through Peter and is talking directly to Satan. We know it's spiritual warfare when the pull in us drags us away from God and His plans.</p>
<p>At the cross Jesus prayed, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.' (Luke 23:34 NKJ) Again, Jesus hints that there's more going on here than the people know about. A 'dark pull' has incited the crowds to scream, 'Crucify! Crucify!' Satan manipulates people to tear you away from God. Your battle is therefore not with people but 'against the powers of this dark world' (Ephesians 6:12 NIV), which is why forgiveness is so important. Satan wants you bound by resentment and revenge, but forgiveness leaves you and the other person in God's hand.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I require your...firstfruits...' Ezekiel 20:40 AMP<br /><br /><p>Jesus must have been a top story teller-why else would crowds hang on His every word? He could have turned the stories into a five-book publishing contract, sold the rights to Hollywood and made mega-bucks.</p>
<p>Or perhaps He would've been more suited to medical school; after all He had a good eye for identifying diseases and then putting them right. He could have lived a comfortable life on a doctor's salary. He could have stuck with carpentry, making fitted wardrobes and chests of drawers on the side. Jesus didn't ask God to bless His comfortable middle class agenda. He sought God's agenda: 'I always do what pleases Him.' (John 8:29 NIV)</p>
<p>Can you think of any story where Jesus seems stressed out and confused? Nope. That's because He daily sought out God's plan and stuck to it, without swerving left or right.</p>
<p>Feeling pulled in 101 different directions right now? Ask God for His one direction. Jesus rose early in the morning to give God the first part of each day. So often we give God the scraps of our day, barely able to concentrate or keep our eyes open, yet we expect to be able to listen. God requires your first-fruits. If rising with the rooster is not your thing, then choose a time of day that is. When your brain is best in gear, accelerate towards God's direction.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will remember My covenant...' Genesis 9:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>We can get so carried away with the Dr Doolittle aspect of the Noah story, we overlook the happy ending. After the flood proclaimed God's verdict on wickedness, a rainbow was painted across the sky as a promise that no deluge would ever devastate the entire world again. God says to Noah, 'I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you.'</p>
<p>God remembers all the promises He's spoken to you too. Perhaps you were once convinced God had given you a word but now you doubt it. You've little evidence to see that promise coming true. Well, God isn't some wheeler-dealer who'll fob you off with 'the cheque's in the mail.' Hebrews 10:23 GNT says, 'Let us hold on firmly to the hope we profess, because we can trust God to keep His promise.'</p>
<p>Life has a nasty habit of trying to contradict God's promises. One minute you're on a high from God's Word; the next life will spring something on you which is completely in opposite of what you heard. Often, this is a case of 'if you want to see the rainbow, you have to put up with the rain.' The pain of hard times causes a passion to lean more on God, which provides an opening for more blessing. So, if you've scrunched up your promise into a paper ball, remember '...no matter how many promises God has made, they are &quot;Yes&quot; in Christ.' (2 Corinthians 1:20 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Barnabas...encouraged them all...' Acts 11:22-23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Being a Christian isn't always happy-clappy, warm, fuzzy feelings. Sometimes people see Jesus in you and get uncomfortable. They single you out for 'freak or unique' treatment. Having Jesus' name stamped on your passport doesn't guarantee you free passage to easy street; in fact, Jesus promises that life will be bumpy if you choose to go His way.</p>
<p>It's always been like that. Never mind 'Christianity: boring, untrue or irrelevant?' Early church Alpha courses would've had sessions entitled, 'Martyrdom: stoning, beheading or crucifixion?'! The first Christians were under so much pressure God had to send them the best encouragers.</p>
<p>One of them-Joseph-was so good at it he was nicknamed Barnabas, 'Son of Encouragement'. He had a special knack for helping people back on their feet when they were feeling the pinch. Acts 11 tells us Barnabas encouraged many to remain true to the Lord, and as the church grew he took a step back to let Paul lead from the front. What an attitude! Barnabas saw the value of stepping out of the limelight in order to best cheer on those up front.</p>
<p>Could you be a Barnabas? '...let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.' (Romans 14:19 ESV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Barnabas...encouraged them all...' Acts 11:22-23 NIV<br /><br /><p>What nickname should your church give you? Motor-mouth? Whinge-bucket? Absent-without-leave? Or 'Son of Encouragement'? When the Bible writers recorded stories involving Joseph of Cyprus, they always used his nickname: Barnabas (which means 'Son of Encouragement'). What a compliment for Joseph, eh?</p>
<p>Examples of his constant source of support are: (1) <i>He put his money where his mouth was</i>. Acts 4 introduces Barnabas as someone who sold a field in order to give money to mission. These aren't just shallow compliments Barnabas is spouting; he's backing his words up with action. (2)<i> He was consistent</i>. Acts 14 tells us that Barnabas accompanied Paul on loads of missionary trips and <i>wherever</i> he went, he'd strengthen Christians. (3) <i>He</i> <i>believed in people</i>. Paul felt let down by John Mark when the kid went AWOL on mission. Barnabas gave him a second chance. Looks like Barnabas was proved right to believe in John Mark, as that same kid seems to have eventually written Mark's Gospel.</p>
<p>Could you be a Barnabas? 'We who are strong in faith should help the weak with their weaknesses, and not please only ourselves.' (Romans 15:1 NCV) Challenge yourself to see others through God's eyes. What inventive ways can you dream up to strengthen and encourage them? Go on, be a Barnabas.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have set the Lord always before me...' Psalm 16:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>We're quick at checking Facebook and we don't it like when we forget to charge our phone. Why? Because we want to be easy to contact and to stay 'in the loop' at all times. It's a shame we don't quite have that same urgency with God. Be honest, if God were a friend on Facebook, how often would you write on His wall? If Jesus was a contact in your phone, how often would you ring?</p>
<p>Any second of any day, without internet connection or top-up credit, you are able to contact God. All the evidence of history shows how important prayer is. So why do we exercise our fingers on Facebook chat but doze when it comes to clasping them in prayer?</p>
<p>Frank Laubach suggested that you'll think more clearly by including God. At mealtime put an extra chair at the table to remind you He's always present. Set a picture of Jesus or a Scripture where you'll see it as you're falling asleep and waking up. Count on it-this will set the tone for your day.</p>
<p>Nobody's saying you have to become technological, but how about diverting some of that Facebook devotion God's way? How about staying in regular contact with your Creator? Update your God status, write on His wall today and 'know the Lord is always with [you].' (Psalm 16:8 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will heal your wounds...' Jeremiah 30:17 AMP<br /><br /><p>The Great Wall of China is thought to stretch nearly 9,000 km. Built originally to keep out the threat of invaders, that's a whole lot of protection!</p>
<p>Some of us can rival the Great Wall's scale and strength by the invisible barriers we build to keep others out. We think if we don't let anybody in we'll be safe from heartbreak. But in the process of barricading others out, we fence ourselves in, creating a prison cell for our hearts. Rather than rely on our own emotional tactics to keep our hearts a disaster-free zone, why not allow the Lord to be our protector?</p>
<p>Now God doesn't promise we'll never get hurt but He does guarantee healing. Jeremiah 30:17 AMP tells us: 'For I will restore health to you, and I will heal your wounds, says the Lord.' Following Jesus means following love, because 'God is love'. Whenever we enter the territory of love we expose our hearts to potential hurt. God put His heart up for pain when He gave up His Son in sacrificial death. 1 John 4:21 GNT tells us that '...whoever loves God must love others also.' </p>
<p>Are you ready to be susceptible to pain? Now is the time to start removing brick-by-brick the wall you've constructed to keep others out. Yes, you'll feel vulnerable but God is with you. God your perfect builder will take great care putting you back together.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the little children come to Me...' Mark 10:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You could change somebody's life forever right now. And all it would take is volunteering to help out with next week's Sunday school. Today's children really are tomorrow's future. By the time a child is five they've learned 75 percent of everything they'll know in life. So if you want to make an impression, that's the time to do it.</p>
<p>In Mark 10 we read about the know-it-all disciples wafting the children away like a bad smell, but Jesus wasn't too happy with this. He says 'let the little children come to me.' Jesus admires the innocent, unwavering trust children have and challenges us to learn from them. Perhaps, if we took God's hand more often across the road, we'd find ourselves in more playful adventures.</p>
<p>Jesus loved and encouraged children: 'He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them.' Wow! Those children would never forget that experience. Imagine looking back to a moment in your life when the Lord picked you up, held you in His arms, laid His hands on you and blessed you! </p>
<p>Well, in years to come, wouldn't it be fantastic to be remembered as the person who excited some great Christian leaders about God when they were kids? Do something beautiful today-invest in a child's tomorrow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man...whose confidence is in [God].' Jeremiah 17:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Remember Jesus on tour of His hometown? There was no grand reception or 'welcome home' banners strung around the place. His childhood neighbours sneered, 'Isn't this the carpenter's son?' (Matthew 13:55 NIV) They might as well have spat in his tea and scoffed, 'Who do you think you are?' In their heads Jesus should get back to hammers and chisels and stop with this 'ministry' nonsense.</p>
<p>Have you ever been there? God has done a beautiful work in you and all people can say is: 'Who do you think you are?' Next time, tell them straight: '...because of Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us from the beginning, and all things happen just as He decided long ago.' (Ephesians 1:11 NLT)</p>
<p>Don't let other people's opinions and expectations shackle your feet. 'Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him.' Only one opinion matters: God's. And He's already given you the seal of approval. 'Be humble under God's powerful hand so He will lift you up when the right time comes. Give all your worries to Him, because He cares about you.'

<introtext><![CDATA['The deeds of a man's hands will return to him.' Proverbs 12:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>A woman noticed an old man struggling to fix his flat tyre in the midday sun. She hoped someone would stop and help but when nobody did, she went back and found the old man weak and perspiring. 'Thanks,' he gasped. 'I prayed somebody would stop.'</p>
<p>The man introduced himself as Bill Krumweide; he talked about his family and his hobby of collecting antique farm equipment. He offered to pay her but the Good Samaritan said, 'Just knowing I was an answer to prayer is enough.' Ten years later the same lady was worried about her aging father, who could no longer take care of the family farm. When she called in a volunteer organisation for help, one of the volunteers looked familiar, and when he introduced himself she realised why. It turned out he was the elderly man's son, Bill Krumweide Jr. 'Thank you for helping my dad all those years ago,' he said. 'I'm the one who owes you,' the woman replied. 'It's amazing how one kindness followed another and connected our families in a bond of gratitude. And it started...with an old man's prayer.'</p>
<p>What goes around comes around: 'The deeds of a man's hands will return to him.' God rewards us 'according to [our] work.' (Proverbs 24:12 NAS) The Bible says, 'knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord...' (Ephesians 6:8 NKJ)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you keep bailing out of relationships every time they hit troubled waters, you'd better get used to your own company-it's the only company you'll have! Relationships can't be based on seeing eye-to-eye on all points, but on a commitment to love each other and a willingness to work for peace. Jesus said, 'God blesses those who work for peace.' (Matthew 5:9 NLT) Notice, peacemaking is 'work', but the rewards are worth it.</p>
<p>Relationships are always worth restoring. God wants us to value our relationships instead of discarding them every time a problem comes along. Paul wrote, 'Does your life in Christ give you strength? Does His love comfort you? ...If so, make me very happy by...sharing the same love, and having one mind and purpose.' (Philippians 2:1-2 NCV)</p>
<p>God wants His family to be known for their love. Strife and bickering send the wrong message to a watching world. Paul was embarrassed when the church in Corinth started splitting into warring factions and taking each other to court. 'Surely there is at least one wise person...who can settle a dispute between fellow Christians.' (1 Corinthians 6:5 GNT) He was shocked and disappointed that nobody was mature enough to resolve conflict peacefully. So he wrote, '...be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>It isn't easy approaching the person with whom you've had a 'friendship malfunction' or 'relationship meltdown'. Sometimes to apologise can seem as appealing as sucking up a sand milkshake. Taking the initiative to talk through your differences can seem like a massive ask, especially when you don't think you're in the wrong anyway!</p>
<p>But God wants what's best for you. He doesn't want you to keep a cocktail of resentment, bitterness, hurt and anger emotions in your system. He wants us to 'go and be reconciled to that person.' (Matthew 5:24 NLT) It's not a sign of weakness to be willing to forgive someone who's hurt you; it's a sign of strength. You're choosing not to be beaten by leaving yourself stuck with hate, but to instead overcome it and move on with peace.</p>
<p>Running to God when we're finding someone difficult and trying to do things Jesus-style will not only help us with our own feelings and circumstances, but it can also enable us to become better friends. Take this little gem: 'Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to get angry.' (James 1:19-20 NLT) Let's be honest, we'd all like to receive a bit of that, especially when trying to get our point across. Take a leaf out of James' book!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>When people get on your nerves, talk like a know-it-all or act like a two-year-old, it's easy to feel your respect levels dropping. Before you know it, the arrow on your dial isn't exactly pointing at Jesus anymore. Very quickly you start behaving and speaking like someone you don't even like-you interrupt, you shout, you dabble in a spot of judging.</p>
<p>Let's swing that arrow back to Jesus. Jesus said, 'Love one another.' (John 13:34 NIV) That's not, 'Love one another except smelly McKelly' or '...except for racist old Uncle Jimbob.' It's love one another, full stop. No exceptions. No omissions.</p>
<p>Loving can cost. Loving can even feel unjust. But remember what Jesus did for you on the cross. He died for us when we were His enemies; He died a sinless man for our sin. The Bible says that if we humble ourselves before the Lord and obey Him, He will hear and forgive us (2 Chronicles 7:14). If we just get on with people who agree, think and act like us we'll never become as loving or humble as God wants us to be.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Fixing something actually takes effort. When we really care about something, we have to think about the best way to do it properly! <i>Uh</i><i>-</i><i>oh! Hello, brain ache!</i> What can be even more work for the old greymatter is when you're trying to fix something more precious than your Aunt Vera's favourite teapot. It's a lot harder to fix a friendship. <i>Oops, here comes a migraine!</i></p>
<p>Fortunately, we're not alone. God has given us lots of help in the Bible on the issue of fixing broken relationships. Here are some top tips: 'If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the fault.' (Matthew 18:15 NLT) 'A gentle answer will calm a person's anger, but an unkind answer will cause more anger.' (Proverbs 15:1 NCV) If you go in with a mindset to listen and respond in a calm way, it will help your temper! 'Use...only helpful words...so that what you say will do good to those who hear you.' (Ephesians 4:29 GNT)</p>
<p>People's reactions to us can very often become easier to accept or understand when we resist hurtling straight in with how wrong they've been, and instead, hold back, listen and take on board how someone else feels about what we've said or done. So keep away from the 'Blame Game'. You're trying to move on and become friends again, remember, not to stay stuck in your own muddy pride puddle!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not think it strange...' 1 Peter 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Do you just skip through life with the Lord, while kittens and lambs dance around your feet? Nah. Sometimes it can seem like you're being beaten up by circumstances and situations. And there are moments that can really shake your faith. </p>
<p>God never said we wouldn't face tough times, but He does promise to keep hold of us and help us through to the other side. 'People who do what is right may have many problems, but the Lord will solve them all.' (Psalm 34:19 NCV) We often learn and grow more as a person when we're going through challenges than we do when life is all hunky-dory. This is mainly because when things seem way too big for us, we finally decide to put more faith in what God can do for us and through us, rather than depending on what we can do on our own.</p>
<p>God didn't make us to be like androids-to never feel or grow. Through tough times we can develop characteristics such as compassion and patience and grow in our relationship with God.</p>
<p>God really wants us to come to Him with all things, not just the hard bits; that's when we really start to shine in who we are in Christ: 'I can do everything with the help of Christ, who gives me the strength I need.' (Philippians 4:13 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['That all of them may be one...' John 17:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>In Heaven there will be no religious labels. If someone has the right to call Jesus 'Lord', you must treat them as your brother or sister regardless of which church they attend. We're all related by blood-the blood of Jesus! The Bible tells us to 'preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' (Ephesians 4:3 NAS) Notice, God doesn't tell us to <i>create</i> unity, He tells us to <i>preserve</i> it.</p>
<p>Comedian Elmo Phillips used to tell this story: 'In a conversation I had recently, I asked, &quot;Are you a Protestant or a Catholic?&quot; My new acquaintance replied, &quot;Protestant.&quot; I said, &quot;Me too!&quot; I asked, &quot;What franchise?&quot; He answered, &quot;Baptist.&quot; &quot;Me too!&quot; I said. &quot;Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?&quot; &quot;Northern Baptist,&quot; he replied. &quot;Me too!&quot; Finally I asked, &quot;Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist, Great Lakes Region, Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist, Great Lakes Region, Council of 1912?&quot; He replied, &quot;'Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist, Great Lakes Region, Council of 1912.&quot; I said, &quot;Die, heretic!&quot;'</p>
<p>Seriously, do you know what Jesus prayed for? 'That all of them may be one...so that the world may believe.' A divided church is a wounded and weak church. What would happen if we downplayed our labels and put our contents on display instead? Maybe we wouldn't need signs outside our door to attract people, because they'd be drawn by the love of those inside. Worth thinking about, isn't it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...knows how weak we are...' Psalm 103:13-14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Do you love those bits in films when you see a character's dream scenario acted out? Chick-flicks always seem to have one. The scene opens with Crystal the Cheerleader, opening her  mouth around a cheeseburger bigger than her head. Suddenly the shot changes to the school bell ringing; it's dream over and back to class for Crystal and her half-eaten celery stick.</p>
<p>Would the film of your dream look like this? Your exam questions fly around you, while you furiously write an essay with one hand, stop your little brother sticking a biro in his ear with the other and let your heartbroken friend squeeze you like her teddy bear, as you give her the same advice you did yesterday. </p>
<p>But then you stop it all by yelling, 'Enough!' they all vanish and, behold, you're on a beach chilling out under a palm tree.</p>
<p>You might love your family and friends and want to help them, but sometimes it can get a bit much. Don't suffer in silence: it's ok to ask for help too, you know. The Bible says: 'A person standing alone can be...defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better.' (Ecclesiastes 4:12 NLT) Also, drinking up truth from God's Word can relax and revitalise you like nothing else: 'Come to me, all of you who are tired from carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest.' (Matthew 11:28 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We were bold in our God...' 1 Thessalonians 2:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The thing all those Christian heroes you read about in books have in common is boldness. You know the type-at the age of 17, our protagonist saves an entire tribe of pygmies armed only with a Gideon's Bible and a dose of courage to rival Buzz Lightyear. </p>
<p>Have you ever dared believe that tomorrow's Christian hero biography could be yours? Seriously! The same Spirit that lives in Nicky Cruz, Brother Andrew and Jackie Pullinger lives in you. In fact, here's a mind-blowing thought: Jesus (He who walked on water and raised people from the dead) says 'anyone who has faith in Me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these...' (John 14:12 NIV)</p>
<p>What?! It seems Jesus is encouraging anyone with enough confidence in God to go on a history-changing, law-of-nature-defying, adventure of a lifetime. But in order to do it, you're going to need to be brave. We're not talking the kind of bravery needed for Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld; we're talking about an audacious confidence in God. We're talking about the ability, to not just study God's Word, but to act upon it. Moses didn't hang about in discussion groups arguing about whether God could part the sea; he took God at His word and placed his feet into the Red Sea. Go on, be brave-have the boldness to take God at His word.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>Esau and Jacob had issues, to say the least. Seriously, these guys put the 'fun' in 'family dys<i>fun</i>ction'. From birth there was trouble. Esau was the first to be born, and so the story goes, Jacob was not far behind, snatching the ankle of his twin brother. A severe case of sibling rivalry was not helped by Mum and Dad. Daddy Isaac unashamedly loved Esau more, whereas Mummy Rebekah was biased towards Jacob.</p>
<p>These were pre-Supernanny days, so with no helping hand to give a few lessons in parenting, the boys were allowed to tear the family apart. Esau comes across as a man's man-a hairy, rugged caveman who worked with his hands in the outdoors, always muddying mum's freshly mopped floor. Jacob is classic mummy's boy material; the indoors type, good in the kitchen, perhaps he was even an embarrassment to dad and bro's testosterone-fuelled culture.</p>
<p>It seems neither boy completely matched up to both parents' expectations. And because the brothers weren't loved unconditionally, division occurred. Esau lived separated from his brother, without the blessing of his father; whereas Jacob left the family home and lived like a wanderer. Do you feel like you've failed your parents' expectations? Maybe your parents have failed you too. But remember God loves you for who you are, not what you can do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>Rebekah favoured Jacob and schemed to steal her eldest son's blessing from her husband. She sent Jacob into his dad's tent armed with a bowl of the latest Masterchef recipe and a full-on Esau disguise (there was probably at least one chest wig involved). Old nearly-blind Isaac, who should've gone to Specsavers, fell for the whole swindle. </p>
<p>From that moment on, the warring brothers became estranged from each other. Jacob began a lifetime on the run, fearful that big bro would kick every lungful of conniving, ankle-grabbing, birthright-stealing breath out of him. Could it have been that Isaac's blatant favouritism for an all-action, sporty man's man left Jacob with deep psychological scars? Perhaps Jacob was uncomfortable in his own skin and running away from home was as much about him running away from himself.</p>
<p>Jacob's pivotal moment occurred when he was on the run. Face to face with an angel, he got asked, 'Who are you?' By that time, Jacob was done pretending-he knew he'd never be Esau. The struggling, broken young man answered, 'I'm Jacob'. He started to become comfortable in his own skin. Today's word: Stop pretending to be what you're not and start appreciating yourself for who you are.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>So we saw what became of Jacob, but whatever happened to Esau? 'When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.' (Genesis 26:34-35 NIV) </p>
<p>So why all the misery? Well, Esau went against the family way here: Hittite or Canaanite women would've been a serious no-no when it came to a bride. By marrying them he went against his parents' wishes and opened himself up to the influence of ungodly customs and practices. No wonder Mum and Dad were upset. Genesis 27:46 says that Rebekah wasn't just grieved, she was 'disgusted with living because of [Esau's] Hittite women.'</p>
<p>Perhaps Esau felt it was payback time for after all those years of bad parenting. After all, why should he respect his mother's choice of suitable women for marriage, when he's hardly been shown any respect from her? Maybe you too have had your Esau moments: 'My best is never good enough, so why bother?' or 'You say one thing and do another. So why should I listen?' or 'So I can't do this? I'll show you!'</p>
<p>The 'I'll show you!' attitude will bite you on the backside. Don't chuck your life away just to make a point. 'The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.' (Proverbs 21:8 NIV) Make your decisions from a pure heart, not a spiteful one.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>Those eight long 'Esau versus Jacob' chapters in Genesis could have looked so different had that earlier verse read, 'Isaac and Rebekah loved the twins both unconditionally' (Genesis 25:28 The Revised 'If only' Version). Unbeknown to them, Isaac and Rebekah were creating a family environment ripe for rivalry, mistrust, bitterness and betrayal.</p>
<p>As Rebekah sets about dressing Jacob as Esau, we are given a living metaphor for identity crisis. Not only was Jacob played off against his brother, he was at that point literally pretending to be him. Perhaps you've known something similar as your own mother has said, 'Why can't you be more like your brother (or sister, or best friend)?' Whenever you're compared to someone else, it's simply not fair. The reason you don't quite have as neat handwriting as the guy next to you or you don't kick a ball as skilfully as the kid from down the road is because you are unique. And that's a good thing.</p>
<p>Nobody on this planet has the same mix of genetic DNA, life experiences, gifts and talents, strengths and weaknesses, personality and character traits, understanding and expressions, as you. You are a one-off priceless masterpiece, carefully knitted together by a Creator who doesn't make mistakes. Comparing you to your neighbour is like comparing a Van Gogh to a Picasso; you're both works of genius. '...it is when the Lord thinks well of us that we are really approved...' (2 Corinthians 10:18 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' Romans 12:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Imagine a one-year-old child is taking his first footsteps. He feels for his balance, steadies his arms, places one foot in front of the other and then crashes down on his nappy. Now imagine his dad rushes straight over, steam hissing out of his ears, and barks in his face, 'Pathetic! That's the second time you've failed this morning! Will you ever learn? It's easy-just place one foot in front of the other. Oh, and another thing; stop pooping in your pants. It's so immature!'</p>
<p>There's something wrong with the picture, isn't there? What father would dismiss a learning child like this? Well, perhaps some of us need to repaint our mental picture of God as our loving Father. Some of us get so frustrated when we fall on our spiritual backsides; we think God is steaming at the ears with us. We convince ourselves that God must've lost patience with us by now. We believe that we've somehow made ourselves unlovable and that God is either blanking us, or at the very least, just humouring us.</p>
<p>Your heavenly dad isn't fuming that you've fell over; He's proud that you tried a few steps. So rather than fixing your eyes on everything that you can't do, everything you can't seem to change, '...let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.' (Romans 12:2 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My conduct will be faultless...in my house...' Psalm 101:2 GNT<br /><br /><p>When two people get married, they usually expect a Hollywood happy ending. But life isn't always holding hands on the beach and picnics on mountaintops. Sometimes people decide to divorce, even when they have children together whom they both love. Divorce is painful for everybody, and never an easy decision. The upshot is that a high percentage of children today are brought up in homes with two adults who aren't both their biological parents.</p>
<p>If this is about to be your story, it's completely ok if you're feeling sad or scared. It may take a long time to feel comfortable with this new family unit, so don't feel guilty if you're not quite feeling your parent's new-found zest for life. Suddenly having a new adult in your life can be very disorientating. You may wonder what to call them (sometimes it's easier to call them by their first name, rather than 'mum' or 'dad'.) You might feel awkward that you quite like this new person, worried that you are somehow betraying your real mum or dad.</p>
<p>Chances are this is really about feeling the loss of what you once had. Well, don't deny your feelings. Jesus says, 'Those...who grieve...will find comfort!' (Matthew 5:4 CEV) It therefore follows that those who pretend everything's fine may not. In short, it's ok to lament the past before rolling into the future.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My conduct will be faultless...in my house...' Psalm 101:2 GNT<br /><br /><p>So we're dealing with our feelings when it comes to living with a new step-parent or being part of what's called a 'blended family'. Having no previous history with this new adult in your life, you may be left wondering about new rules and whether you have to listen to your new step-parent. Hopefully, this new adult is someone else looking after your interests and welfare, so it's a good idea to afford them the same level of respect you'd offer your mum, dad or teacher.</p>
<p>You might worry about school holidays or Christmas time; where will you be when presents are handed out? Any worry is a legitimate worry. You might want to talk it through with a parent alone or call a family meeting; whatever way best suits you. Getting used to this other person watching TV shows that you never watch, taking extra-long baths when you want a shower, or laughing at jokes which just aren't funny, can take some effort.</p>
<p>It's not easy adapting to a new way of life. Sharing mum or dad with a new person definitely takes some getting used to. So don't bottle your feelings up or deliberately try and make life difficult. Let your mum or dad know what's going on with you. Understand yourself and each other. After all, 'It takes wisdom to have a good family, and it takes understanding to make it strong.' (Proverbs 24:3 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For He is always thinking about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 TLB<br /><br /><p>In the introduction to his book <i>The Father Heart of God</i>, Floyd McClung writes about a painting by artist Karel Appel. He describes the painting: a tall, stick-like, lifeless monster with dark harsh colours. The writer is saddened to learn the original title of the artist's work: <i>My Father</i>. He says, 'What kind of relationship did Karel Appel have with his father? Even more important, how [did] that affect his view of God? If Karel Appel believed in God...did he believe Him to be a loving Father?'</p>
<p>Perhaps some of us suffer from Karel Appel's artistic eye. Bad experiences of unreliable parenting, scary father figures or absent dads leave their mark on us. They make it hard for us to accept God as a perfect, loving Father. Too many of us imagine a monstrous overbearing father, short on patience, looking down on us.</p>
<p>Jesus didn't just call God His Father, He called God 'Abba'. Now, 'Abba' doesn't translate perfectly into English, but to get a feel for the meaning of the word, imagine a small child, looking up with love and saying 'Dada'. Jesus often advises us to behave like kids when it comes to trusting in God, because he understands how much God loves us unconditionally, like a proud dad to a newborn baby. All theology and bad experiences aside, today Dada God wants to lift you off your feet with His big, heavenly bear-hugs.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For He is always thinking about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 TLB<br /><br /><p>The problem with language and God is that eventually our language lets us down. We desperately want to understand that God is warm and loving and approachable, so our language comes up with ways to say this. We start to describe God as a dad.</p>
<p>The problems start because the word 'dad' conjures up all kinds of ideas and images for different people. Dad might be chained to his work office for most of the week. So, because dad is never around, we get the idea that God is somehow distant, too busy for us. Dad might be tired and grumpy. So, because we're made to feel like a nuisance around our dad, we picture God as angry and quick to jump on us. Dad may not have been around for years. So it becomes hard to relate to God the Father, as we don't really know what it's like to have a dad in our lives.</p>
<p>Our minds try to paint a picture of God, but the image becomes hopelessly distorted because of our flawed experiences. Jesus once said, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father.' (John 14:9 RSV) The qualities of Jesus point us to the qualities of our heavenly Father: forgiving and merciful, loving and patient, inclusive and accepting. Through Jesus' love and concern for people we see what God the Father really looks like.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For He is always thinking about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 TLB<br /><br />
<p>The baby left whimpering in a cot, tired of crying and nobody coming. The young child shushed in front of the TV so as not to disturb dad. The girl singing solo in the school show with no mum or dad to clap on the night. It's no wonder we struggle to completely trust God the Father when we've been let down by our earthly parents.</p>
<p>If our minds are wrestling to think of a time when God has ever shown He loved us, it's because those who should have loved us have let us down. God's love should be modelled through the arms, hearts and voices of those nearest to us in our lives. Your heavenly Father stored away each tear as you whimpered in your cot. Your heavenly Father pulled up a seat next to you as you were silenced, alone in front of the television. Your heavenly Father was the first on His feet applauding as you sang your heart out at the school concert.</p>
<p>If you've reached today without experiencing God's love for you, then know this: God hasn't let you down, people have. Your family home should have been four walls of love, acceptance, forgiveness and security-a place to experience God's love. No matter who you are, or where you're from, God your loving Father awaits you today with two outstretched arms ready to hug away those hurts from now into eternity.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Led by the Spirit of God...' Romans 8:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Have you ever had the idea God was asking you to do something but you make the fatal error of broadcasting it? Suddenly, everybody has to give you their ten cents worth. Mum says one thing, your mates say another and even one or two people with 'I've got a word from God...' which is a Bible verse that leaves you scratching your head wondering whether it has anything to do with your idea at all.</p>
<p>It's always a good idea to test an idea with people who have a good track record for godly wisdom, but when all's said and done, it's up to you to hear from God about your own life. The responsibility is all yours. If you're not careful you can be pulled in all sorts of directions and end up absolutely nowhere. 'The Lord is good and does what is right; He shows the proper path to those who go astray.' (Psalm 25:8 NLT)</p>
<p>So how can you make sure where God is leading? Honest prayer. God doesn't get cross when we present our confusion to Him. Hold your hands up and speak what's on your heart. For example: 'God, I'm confused right now. I think I'm hearing you but I need to make sure. Please make it clear to me-what should I do?'</p>
<p>When we spend enough time listening, soon a peace will silence all the other voices and you'll gain the confidence to step out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Led by the Spirit of God...' Romans 8:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There's a warning in the Old Testament to listen to God rather than the voices of men. God's people are told to take hold of the Promised Land for themselves but everybody, except Joshua and Caleb, listens to the voice of fear. Reports become so exaggerated people are too scared to hear the voice of God.</p>
<p>If you really believe God has tasked you an assignment, get on with it. There'll always be the <i>Pessimism Pack</i> telling you it can't be done. There'll always seem to be others off on exciting adventures that will make you feel like small fish. And there's bound to be butterflies criss-crossing your stomach. Listen for God's guidance then throw yourself off the high board. 'I am Your servant; give me understanding, so that I may know Your teachings... The explanation of Your teachings gives light and brings wisdom to the ignorant.' (Psalm 119:125, 130 GNT)</p>
<p>The key is to focus on your potential, not your limitations. We all have limitations, so it's good to learn to accept them. In fact, it's our limitations that stop us from running away with ourselves thinking it's our job to save the world. It's not our job, it's God's job. Our limits will take us to our knees and draw on His strength. 'Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.' (1 Corinthians 1:25 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Seek the Kingdom of God above all else...' Matthew 6:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>You know when you read a word over and over (and over and over again) it begins to lose its meaning? It can be the same with God's Word. We study it over and over (and over and over again) until we lose what it's really saying to us.</p>
<p>Like, 'Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come, Your will be done...' (Matthew 6:9-10 NIV) We can repeat those words so many times parrot-fashion that we lose what they mean. We can rattle them off like a spiritual good luck charm without stopping to think about the meaning. If we're really serious about God's Kingdom coming, and His will being done, then we give God permission to have His way in our lives. Did you get that? His way-not ours. When God says stop, we stop. When God says go, we go.</p>
<p>'...it is not merely knowing the law that brings God's approval. Those who obey the law will be declared right in God's sight.' (Romans 2:13 NLT) So when God says we should love our enemies, what do we do? Deconstruct it as a line of poetry or actually <i>do it</i>? Actively care for our rivals? When Jesus tells us to give a gift to those in need, what do we do? Nod along in agreement to this lofty ideal, or do we actually hit our pockets where it hurts and bless the poor?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Seek the Kingdom of God above all else...' Matthew 6:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we started to look at the difference between knowing what the ink in your Bible says and knowing what the ink in your heart does. Matthew 12:50 NCV says, 'My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what my Father in Heaven wants.'</p>
<p>Jesus says we should be compassionate, and yet how many times do we walk straight past the guy collecting for charity as if he were a ghost? Jesus says we should patch up with friends who've hurt us. He doesn't mention anything about revenge. He doesn't say we should cheer when that friend comes a cropper. Jesus says we should surrender ourselves: 'If any of you wants to be My follower, you must put aside your selfish ambition, shoulder your cross, and follow Me.' (Matthew 16:24 NLT) Notice He doesn't say, 'Pray, pray and pray again until God changes His mind and follows your plans.' Jesus says we should think like a servant, not elbow our way to the front or hoist ourselves to the top.</p>
<p>We should use our talent and muscle to help others rise to the top. Putting the Kingdom of God above all else isn't in line with the 'I, me, mine' disease of modern life. 'You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose the easy way.' (Matthew 7:13 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others...' Matthew 6:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>It's Christmas Eve. If what's on your mind most is: 'What will I get?', you need to start thinking about Christmas the right way up! Christmas is all about <i>giving,</i> not getting. </p>
<p>How did you decide who to give pressies to this Christmas? Do you only give presents to those who will give one back? Are you good at guesstimating how much someone will spend on you so you don't spend more on them?  Are some crossed off your Christmas list because you don't like them, don't know them or think they deserve nothing from you? What are your reasons for wrapping? What are your motives for giving?</p>
<p>The Bible says, 'Be careful not to do your good works in public in order to attract attention. If you do, your Father in Heaven will not reward you.' (Matthew 6:1 GWT)</p>
<p>Look how God gives: He gave the most precious thing He had to everyone. He didn't pick favourites, He gave to all; He didn't scrimp on the budget, He gave the most valuable thing He had; He didn't give because we'd done so well and deserved such a gift, He gave because He wanted us to have what we needed. He didn't give His gift under certain contractual conditions, He gave freely, knowing we would destroy His priceless gift: 'For God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.' (John 3:16 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They entered the house... they...worshipped Him...and gave Him gifts.'  Matthew 2:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>Living the Christian life isn't exactly the easiest. But it is definitely the most exciting and best. Take Mary and Joseph. Getting pregnant when you're an unmarried teenager is hard enough today. Back then it was much tougher. But this is what God asked Mary to do. He worked one of His fantastic-but freaky-miracles so she would conceive a baby, leaving her to explain her innocence to her fianc, Joseph. He, of course, was confused. Come on, put yourself in his shoes. He hadn't slept with her but she was pregnant, supposedly with the Son of God!</p>
<p>Joseph wasn't at all convinced until God turned up in his dreams. Then he chose to obey. Still, it wasn't easy-imagine the gossip, the back-stabbing, the parties they weren't invited to. Then there was that torturous journey to Bethlehem, giving birth in the cold and putting the baby in an animal trough-disgusting just doesn't cut it.</p>
<p>Mary and Joseph just went were God placed them and did what He asked. Result: God brought to them everything they needed. They never went out or sent messages asking for presents on that first Christmas Day. And later, God sent them wise men on camels loaded with gifts. God will provide for you too-the camels are coming-so hang in there.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is close to the brokenhearted...' Psalm 34:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you got the post-Christmas blues? The excitement of yesterday's pressies and partying has worn off. You've OD'd on chocolate and TV Christmas specials; Christmas carols have turned into Christmas quarrels and you really can't face a visit to Grandma and her sloppy kisses.</p>
<p>Perhaps Christmas is something you dread-there's no festive jolly joy for you. 'Here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun,' blasts out on the radio for the umpteenth time and you want to scream at it, 'Not everyone's having fun!' You're right, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean all our problems disappear or we have a break from our struggles-but Christmas is the solution, not the salt in the wound. </p>
<p>Christina Rossetti wrote, 'What can I give Him, Poor as I am? If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb, If I were a wise man I would do my part, Yet what I can I give Him, Give my heart.' If your heart is breaking, broken or shattered, give it to Jesus. He'll mend you up, put you straight and fit you back together, better than you were before. </p>
<p>'The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.' He never leaves us; He chooses to help us, to put things right-that's why He sent Jesus. Jesus said: 'I have come in order that you might have life-life in all its fullness.' (John 10:10 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Samson went down...' Judges 14:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Samson is a classic case of brawn over brains. He could rip the roar from a lion's throat or grab the growl from a grizzly's gullet but he couldn't tame his temptation for the wrong sort of woman. The story says that three times 'Samson went down' to see a Philistine woman. So the man who could reach bare-arm into a bee's nest for something sweet finds himself stung by the wrong girl. </p>
<p>The Philistines were enemies of God. Remember Goliath the giant, shouting abuse at David about his shabby little God-well, he was a Philistine. So what was God's chosen, Samson, doing sniffing around the enemy? Well he was clearly thinking about giving into temptation, not holding onto his faith.</p>
<p>Can you relate to this? Times when you choose sensation over sanctification? Pleasure over purity? Indulgence over innocence? Samson chose a path which led him to become a blind prisoner shorn of all his strengths. When God says 'no' to a relationship, or a habit or a lifestyle, He's not being a killjoy, He's protecting you. God sees where the road leads; you don't. 'Some people ruin themselves by their own stupid actions and then blame the Lord.' (Proverbs 19:3 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['See, I am doing a new thing...' Isaiah 43:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>We try and pin down God in the silence of a cathedral. Or we somehow think burning a candle will woo Him down from Heaven; as if the real problem is He's got lost in the dark trying to find us!</p>
<p>But sometimes God surprises us. Sometimes He turns up as a voice in a burning bush. Sometimes He shrinks down to a foetus in the womb of an unmarried Jewish girl. And sometimes He's found hanging from a tree in between two common criminals. God will not be pinned down by our thin expectations. God shocks us in many guises, always announcing, 'See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up, do you not perceive it?'</p>
<p>There's the challenge, right there-our perceptions. We fail to recognise God at work. Ever been frustrated? You've prayed until your brain is asking for mercy, you've had enough of God's promises to hang your hat on, and still seen nothing? Well, try this for size: 'For the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all who wait for Him.' (Isaiah 30:18 NIV)</p>
<p>You might have your timetables sketched out, but the Lord says 'wait'. 'Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' (Proverbs 19:21 NIV) Time is on your side because the one who wears eternity around his wrist says 'wait'. Stay alert-tomorrow could be the new thing.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.' Psalm 80:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'Revival' seems like one of those Christian jargon words that gets aired so often, you're almost too embarrassed to ask, 'What does it actually mean?'</p>
<p>The last two great revivals to hit Britain happened in the Scottish islands and Wales. Both saw massive changes in culture. In the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, the islands stopped-people put down their drinks and their work tools to go to church. They just felt compelled to meet God, whether they'd thought of themselves as Christians or not. The islands reported no more crime. The revival seemed to turn life the right way up. </p>
<p>In Wales, crowds normally reserved for footie grand finals were seen swarming into church. If you wanted to be baptised, you'd have to join the back of a queue which was 100000 people long. Swear words were swapped for worship songs. The whole place felt so different that even animals no longer recognised their owners. </p>
<p>Revival is like God breathing fresh air into the lungs of the dead. Revival is God resuscitating our lives back in order. Matt Redman wrote a powerful song called, '<i>Send revival, start with me</i>' The song nails it. If we want to see our city put back on its feet, we need to make sure we're on our knees first. In prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.' Psalm 80:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Today we're going to look at some thoughts on preparing yourself for your own personal revival.</p>
<p>First, get frustrated with yourself. When you're smug about your cosy little life, there's no room for change. If you were to take pen and pad to all your short-cuts and excuses, how would you match up to the words of Jesus? Allowing God to test your thoughts and attitudes is the first step to personal holiness: 'Examine me, O Lord, and test me. Look closely into my heart and mind.' (Psalm 26:2 GWT)</p>
<p>Secondly, put the time in. You wouldn't expect to develop perfect abs and pecs by exercising your mouth with a 'Burger of the Day', would you? Neither can you expect to develop spiritual muscle by exercising time apart from God. There's always going to be an episode of your favourite tv show or a new console game fighting for your attention. Switch the thing off and '...turn to God, so you can be cleansed of your sins.' (Acts 3:19 NLT) </p>
<p>Thirdly, put things right: 'For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.' (Matthew 6:14 NIV) Lord, send revival-and start with me!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We become more and more like Him...' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>'HAPPY NEW YEAR!' is what most of us will be shouting at midnight tonight. New Year's resolutions will be made, hoping a new 'thinner, fitter, healthier me' will emerge in 2012. The Bible says, 'become more and more like Him.' So how about we make this our New Year's resolution-everyday choosing to become more and more like Jesus?</p>
<p>How will it happen? Well, to make us more Christ-like, God will use His Word, other people, and difficult circumstances. God's Word provides the truth we need to <i>know</i>, God's people provide the support we need to <i>grow</i>, and difficult circumstances will provide the environment we need to <i>show</i> Christ-likeness. If you apply God's Word, connect regularly with other believers, and learn to trust God in every situation, you will become more like Jesus. Count on it-it will happen! </p>
<p>'we will hold to the truth in love, becoming more and more in every way like Christ... Under His direction, the whole body is fitted together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow... Since you...have learned the truth that is in Jesus, throw off...your former way of life, which is rotten through and through, full of lust and deception. Instead, there must be a spiritual renewal of your thoughts and attitudes. You must display a new nature because you are a new person, created in God's likeness.' (Ephesians 4:15-24 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>HAPPY NEW YEAR! So-are you the kind of person who makes hundreds of New Year's resolutions every year, and then come Jan 4, you've already gone and broken most of them? Have you made any yet this year? How long do you think they'll last?! </p>
<p>Well, how about this year, instead of the normal routine, you make a resolution to check out God's vision for your life, and see what you can do about it? </p>
<p>What actually is a 'vision'? Is it some weird hallucination thing that'll hover in front of your eyes, making you wonder if it really was a good idea to munch out on the whole of that cold pizza? If that's the case, I can understand you thinking: 'No thanks, I'll pass on a vision this year!'</p>
<p>But that's not the kind of vision we're talking about here. What we're talking about is more like a plan, or a dream. It's about what God can do, and wants to do, through you and your life. Maybe that still sounds a bit scary to you-but don't panic! God won't ask you to do anything you can't do. In fact, He'll ask you to do something only you <i>can </i>do. You'll be the perfect person for the job. Sounds pretty good to me. What better New Year's resolution could there be than getting really stuck into God's plan for your life?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Elijah was afraid and fled for his life...' 1 Kings 19:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Read up on Elijah, and you'll discover he led an incredible life for God: He was a prophet, meaning God gave him knowledge of future events (1 Kings 17); he was given supernatural running strength that would have had Olympic gold medallists eating his dust (1 Kings 18:46); he was the first recorded person in the Bible to raise someone from the dead (1 Kings 17:22); he divided a river with his coat (2 Kings 2:8); he once braved odds of 450 to 1 challenging the prophets of Baal to prove that his God was more powerful than theirs-and of course he won (1 Kings 18:22-24).</p>
<p>These are just a few highlights in the life of Elijah. You'd think he'd be a fearless, confident, impressive guy 100% of the time. But truth is, even Elijah had times when he let fear rule. Once, when threatened by a queen, 'Elijah was afraid and fled for his life.'</p>
<p>Words can have a powerful effect on us. If we're not careful then, just like Elijah, we can become gripped with fear, thrown into depression, and feel totally intimidated and worthless.</p>
<p>Don't listen to the voice of fear; listen to the voice of God. He will make you fearless. 2 Timothy 1:7 NLT says, 'God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will work for you today...' Exodus 14:13 AMP<br /><br /><p>Paul Parker once said, 'Fear is the most devastating of all human emotions. Man has no trouble like the paralysing effects of fear.' Florence Nightingale once said, 'How very little can be done under the spirit of fear.' And they're right-fear stops us from living fully. We stop doing things, afraid it might go wrong; we don't speak up, afraid someone might laugh at us, not believe us or make us look a fool; we don't use our talents, afraid we won't be good enough; we don't try, afraid we might fail.</p>
<p>It has been said that fear is like the darkroom where the devil takes you to develop your negatives. But fear and faith can't live together-when one enters the other leaves. So the way to get rid of your fears, the way to become fearless, is to let God into your life. 1 John 4:18 NIV says, '...perfect love drives out fear...'</p>
<p>If life for you is scary, stop and remind yourself whose company you're in. Deuteronomy 31:8 NLT says; 'Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you; He will neither fail you nor abandon you.' Courage is fear that has said its prayers, so feed your faith and your fears will starve to death. When fear knocks at your door, answer with faith and you'll discover there's no one there.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He knows where I am going.' Job 23:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Do you get fed up with people asking you things like: 'What are you going to do when you grow up? Are you going to university? What career path are you taking?' Do you feel pressured into having to answer when all you want is to shout back, 'I don't know, please stop asking me!' </p>
<p>Do you feel pressured by your boyfriend or girlfriend who wants you to 'prove' your love by having sex; your friends who want you to solve your 'down' feeling by taking drugs or getting drunk; or others who say you have to stick up for yourself by using your fists?</p>
<p>Does life sometimes get a bit too much? Do you get confused, does your head hurt and do your insides scream: 'Leave me alone! I just don't know!'?</p>
<p>There's a book in the Bible named after a man called Job, whose life became unbearable: 'Darkness is all around me; thick, impenetrable darkness is everywhere.' (Job 23:17 NLT) His mind was confused by circumstances and his friends' opinions. But Job knew in this muddled mess that he could completely trust God. 'He knows where I am going,' Job said. He knew he could trust God to help him out of his muddled mess. He just had to stick with God, living life His way. The same is true for you today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you are displeased, I will go back.' Numbers 22:34 NIV<br /><br /><p>Not many can resist the adorable Donkey from the <i>Shrek</i> movies. But did you know that Shrek wasn't the first to hear a talking donkey? That privilege was given to Balaam. He was a prophet who told people what God said. He believed that he must obey God, no matter what.</p>
<p>One time, people from a country called Moab asked Balaam for help. God made it very clear that what they were asking wasn't right, so at first Balaam sent them away. But the Moabites kept offering bigger and better bribes. Balaam began to struggle to put into practice what he knew in theory. When he went wrong, God used his donkey to show him: 'Then the Lord opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, &quot;What have I done...to make you beat me...three times?&quot; ...The angel of the Lord asked him, &quot;Why have you beaten your donkey...? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one...&quot; Balaam said, &quot;I have sinned. ... if you are displeased, I will go back.&quot;' (Numbers 22:28-34 NIV)</p>
<p>Doing what you know is right can be hard at times. And when we make a mistake and don't correct it, we end up making another mistake. Ask God if there is something you need to put right today and go sort it out. God may not tell you through a donkey-but He will let you know.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give [you] favour...' Exodus 3:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There are so many people who don't expect anything good in life. They don't expect to get breaks, they don't expect good grades or to get a job they really want. They don't expect anything positive. Are you one of them? Do you think you'll always be 'the bridesmaid, never the bride' or always 'the friend, never the boyfriend'? Do you go around thinking people have 'got it in for you' and your family is the worst ever?</p>
<p>Could this be your attitude towards God too? Do you think that God's got it in for you? Do you say things like, 'God would never want to do anything good for me and I've got a whole lifetime of events to prove it'? If you've got a big chip on your shoulder, now's the time to knock it off.</p>
<p>Listen! What God said to the Israelites thousands of years ago He says to you today: 'I will give [you] favour.' The Israelites were hostages, slaves trapped inside the enemy's camp and so they prayed for freedom. They asked God for favour and He gave it them. He did it in the most unexpected ways-using frogs, boils, locusts to name just a few (read Exodus to find out more). Proverbs 16:3 NLT says 'Commit your actions to the Lord, and your plans will succeed.' He will 'give you favour' in the most unexpected ways.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'A man must be content to receive the gift...given him from Heaven...' John 3:27 AMP<br /><br /><p>Have you ever ruined something by trying to use it for something it wasn't designed for? Like  using your bed as a trampoline? Or using your shoe as a hammer, turning high heels into flatties? Or using the garage door as a goal and it still has the dents to prove it?</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:10 NIV tells us, 'we are God's handiwork, created...to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' Notice that it doesn't say we were all created identically to do exactly the same things. So it's really important we find out what we're good at-what God prepared for us-and get on with it. We mustn't allow jealousy to creep in and ruin what we have.</p>
<p>Disciples of John the Baptist became nervous when Jesus arrived in town because people began to follow Jesus and not John. But John replied, 'A man must be content to receive the gift...given him from Heaven... I am not the Christ... I have [only] been sent before Him...to be His appointed forerunner, His messenger.' (John 3:27-28 AMP) John knew there is no sense in competing and comparing yourself to others, we are simply to do what we've been created to do. Simply be you!</p>
<p>Corrie ten Boom, a Dutch Christian holocaust survivor who helped many Jews escape the Nazis during World War II, said this: 'Don't bother to give God instructions; just report for duty.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Forgiveness...in accordance with the riches of...grace.' Ephesians 1:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you speak to anyone who has done some sales training they'll tell you one of the first things they learn is the acronym 'K.I.S.S.' It means 'Keep It Simple, Stupid' and it's a reminder to deliver every sales presentation in such a simple way that the listener understands straight away.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can overcomplicate the things God says to us too. The verse today is about how much God lavishly loves and forgives us. God tells us His love and forgiveness is unconditional-we don't get it because we earn it or deserve it, but because He chooses to pile it on us by the bucket load.</p>
<p>But He also tells us He wants <i>us</i> to do the same to others. This is where it can get a little more complicated. It's easy to accept God's forgiveness for ourselves, but nowhere near as easy to give it to others. Love and forgive those who don't deserve it? Those we don't like very much? Strangers? Those we've already given 10 chances too? But that doesn't seem fair! It doesn't seem right! You see, we make it complicated.</p>
<p>At times like this we need to hear God whispering in our ear, 'Keep It Simple ,Stupid!' When we overcomplicate the simplest of instructions from God it makes a mess of our lives. Nothing fits right, relationships break down, life becomes a hassle. By making God's love complicated, we miss out on it and make others miss out on it too. So, every day remember to K.I.S.S!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Like the blind we grope...feeling our way like men without eyes...' Isaiah 59:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you noticed how small children have a tendency to bump into things, fall off seats, tumble down stairs, or trip over the most obvious of objects in their way? You can quite often hear their parents shouting, 'Watch where you're going! Watch what you're doing!' Perhaps you remember your parents saying that to you (perhaps they still do?). Parents aren't saying those things to be spoilsports; they're saying it to try and protect the children they love from a nasty fall.</p>
<p>Romans 3:23 NLT tells us, 'Everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard.' Everyone has tripped up, messed up and fallen away from God. When we do, the Bible says, 'Like the blind we grope...feeling our way like men without eyes.'</p>
<p>God, our heavenly Father, doesn't want us to live like this so He tells us to watch where we're going. He's not criticising your clumsiness, He is saying: look up, look out, look ahead never lose sight of all I am, what I can do and will do-so don't be tempted to turn away from Me.</p>
<p>Let Psalm 119:10-11 be your prayer today: 'I seek You with all my heart; do not let me stray from Your commands. I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the testing of your faith develops perseverance...' James 1:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>You can often hear parents of small babies say, 'Oh I don't want him to grow up, I want him to stay just like this, he's soooo cute!' They don't really mean it; they're just expressing how much they're enjoying their baby. If their baby didn't grow and change, they'd be off down the hospital straight away, extremely worried and concerned. They know there's so much more for that child: walking, running, football, dancing, riding a bike.</p>
<p>Change is an important part of life. The Bible says 'God is kind to you so you will change your hearts and lives.' (Romans 2:4 NCV) God loves us just the way we are, but He loves us too much to leave us that way.</p>
<p>The book in the Bible that really helps us understand this is the book of James (believed to have been written by the brother of Jesus). It is full of good practical advice of how to live following Jesus. Basically James is saying: <i>don</i><i>'</i><i>t just know it, show it!</i> We must have faith that results in action. Faith, if it is real, changes people. Many religions in the world demand you to keep a set of rules but Christianity goes further and insists that faith on the inside is what changes your behaviour on the outside. So make change your new best friend: '...let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything.' (James 1:4 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We get up again and keep going.' 2 Corinthians 4:9 TLB<br /><br /><p>Are you fed-up? Do you dream of being like Cinderella-having a fairy godmother to wave a magic wand and make everything in your life better? Here's a secret: don't pray for an easier life; pray to be a stronger person.</p>
<p>God doesn't usually change our tough situations in an instant-sometimes He asks us to 'get up again and keep going.' But don't give in because, as Paul writes to the Romans: 'But that's not all... we know that suffering creates endurance, endurance creates character, and character creates confidence. We're not ashamed to have this confidence, because God's love has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit.' (Romans 5: 3-5 GWT)</p>
<p>Charles Spurgeon said, 'By perseverance the snail reached the ark.' It was a tough old snail trail, but what a great place he ended up! The Wright Brothers had a 'flying problem', but with every setback they got up again and kept on going, until finally they invented the world's first successful aeroplane. Helen Keller's childhood illness left her blind and deaf but Helen kept on going in spite of her difficulties and became a successful author, lecturer and political campaigner bringing about many positive changes for people born with disabilities.</p>
<p>Who knows how God will change things for you when you 'get up again and keep on going'? There's only one way to find out. As the saying goes, 'Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut that held its ground.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have learned to be content...' Philippians 4:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Does your mood change with your circumstances? Can you be all right one minute, then want to punch someone's lights out the next? Can you be exuding confidence only minutes before collapsing in an emotional heap? Would you go into meltdown if you had to leave the house with no make-up on? Would you throw a hissy fit if you had to move to a less desirable neighbourhood?</p>
<p>Don't worry, you're not alone. Every one of us has insecurities and finds it difficult to cope when things change. But God didn't create us to bumble our way through life, cracking up whenever things don't quite go as planned. He wants us to be content.</p>
<p>Paul said, 'I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and...to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry...in plenty or in want. I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:11-13 NIV)</p>
<p>Paul didn't have a contented personality type-he <i>learned</i> to be content, which means we can learn it too. No matter how much or how many times your life, relationships or circumstances change, sign yourself up to God's school and learn to be content like Paul-it's the key to a happier life!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will be glad and rejoice in your unfailing love...' Psalm 31:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>If someone offered you a $100 note today, would you take it? Oh come on, you don't have to think so hard; it's not a trick question! Of course you would!</p>
<p>But what if they screwed it up, shoved it in their mouth, chewed on it and then offered it to you? You still want it? Sure you do! If they then blew their nose on it, you still gonna take it? Course you are! Even if they threw it in the dirt and stomped on it, you're still up for it, aren't you? It may have been misused, chewed and spat on, but it has never lost its value. That $100 is still $100. Its value is still the same.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can experience very harsh changes in our lives. These might be caused by others around us or our own bad choices; sometimes a mixture of both. These changes can leave us feeling used and abused, broken and incomplete, useless and worthless.</p>
<p>But with God you never lose your value, no matter what has happened in your life. Today, He says to you: 'You are precious and honoured in My sight...I love you.' (Isaiah 43:4 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Remove from our lives anything that would get in the way...' Hebrews 12:1 NCV<br /><br /><p>Leave a boiled sweet in your pocket and it's amazing what it will pick up. It may go in looking scrummylicious. But it's sure to come out looking more like something from outer space than from the corner shop. Its sugary coating will have latched on to bits of fluff and all kinds of random particles. It's in no fit state to deliver you its sugary treat any more. Too much fluff has gotten in the way-it's carrying extra baggage.</p>
<p>Just like the unsuspecting boiled sweet, we can get thrown into messy situations that leave us carrying extra baggage. A relationship ends and you're left with baggage. You can carry around the belief that you're not pretty enough or you're unlovable. At school you get bullied and you're left with baggage. You carry around fear and pain. Your parents always compare you to your brother or sister and you're left with baggage. You carry around a never-good-enough complex. You believe the magazine that tells you your body isn't perfect and you're left with baggage. You carry around an eating disorder.</p>
<p>With God there is no baggage allowance. He says we need to 'remove from our lives anything that would get in the way and the sin that so easily holds us back.' There is no need for us to go any further carrying stuff we don't need, collecting fluff that holds us back or baggage that weighs us down.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Hallowed be Your name.' Matthew 6:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>You might call yourself a Christian; but do those who know you best agree? You say you're a Christian but would strangers notice? Can people tell by the way you talk, act, and behave that you are following Jesus?</p>
<p>Acts 11:26 NLT tells us, 'It was there at Antioch that the believers were first called Christians.' That new church at Antioch was a curious mixture of people. The one thing that they all had in common was not race, culture or language-it was Jesus. They must have made it so obvious, or why else would people call them Christians ('Christ-ones')? What about you? Do you make it obvious?</p>
<p>When we pray the Lord's Prayer we say, 'Hallowed be Your name.' We're saying, 'God I believe You are the best there is and all I want to do is make You look good.' Words mean nothing, however, unless they're backed up with actions. </p>
<p>Ever had those embarrassing family resemblance conversations: 'Ooh... you've got your Auntie Ethel's ears and your Uncle Albert's big bellowing laugh!' They're not really conversations; they're more like embarrassing accusations you can do nothing about.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 GWT says, '...a believer in Christ is a new creation. The old way of living has disappeared. A new way of living has come...' Can everyone see the family likeness in you? Do they know you're God's child?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My help comes from the Lord...' Psalm 121:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>What do you do when you need help? Maybe you go to your closest mates, or your parents, or someone you look up to. And all of that is good and advisable. But first-try God. It can be a revolutionary idea that changes your circumstance or your view of the circumstance all together! So next time you need help, remember this: before you run to the phone, run to the Throne!</p>
<p>Next time you need help, remember that God always hears and answers your prayers. When you call God, you won't hear, 'I'm sorry but God's not available at the moment. Please leave a message after the harp.' You won't hear an engaged tone and you won't get put on hold. You'll never hear an automated voice with a list of dialling options: 'Hello, you're through to Heaven. If you're calling about your naughty little problem, press 6.'</p>
<p>God wants you to call Him every day and tell Him what's on your mind; He's always got time to talk to you. So, 'Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything...present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 4:6-7 NIV) Life is fragile-handle with prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is...giving you...power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>All our lives can be summed up in one word: history. Your life as a child is now history. Even the day you're living today will soon be yesterday-that's history. Now, pay attention: it's called History, not 'Our-story' or 'My-story' but 'His-story'; because everyone who has ever lived has lived in His story-God's Story.</p>
<p>Life began with God: 'In the beginning God created the Heavens and the earth' (Genesis 1:1 NLT); and it will end with God, 'Heaven and earth will disappear, but My words will remain forever.' (Mark 13:31 NLT) So all the bits in between must belong to God too. This means your life began with God and you are in His story. You're here because God wanted you here; your life is about God, His story.</p>
<p>When you were a baby you naturally thought the whole world revolved around you. You'd cry when you needed something and would expect everyone to come running. That's ok for babies-they need a lot of attention and help in order to develop and grow. But now that you're older you need to throw off the it's-all-about-me attitude and start living His story. In His story your life is packed with purpose: 'For God is working in you, giving you...power to do what pleases Him.' It also lasts forever: 'I will live in the house of the Lord forever.' (Psalm 23:6 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He controls my destiny.' Job 23:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Do you ever think, 'Sometimes, God, you just don't know what you're doing'? It seems perfectly obvious to you because, from where you're standing, it looks like God hasn't got a clue about you, your family, your friends, your neighbourhood, your country or even the world. You think, 'If you did know what you were doing, God, then none of us would be in this mess, would we?'</p>
<p>If you ever think the only reason God doesn't fix things must be because He can't, and the only reason He doesn't sort things out is because He doesn't know how, then it's time to take a look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>For example, if you think you're having a bad day, read the book of Job. That man had it tough but, as bad as it got, Job kept on trusting God: 'He will do to me whatever He has planned. He controls my destiny.' Job saw the bigger picture.</p>
<p>If you have been on a plane you will notice how different things look from up there in the sky than down here on the ground-very different in fact! In Isaiah 55:8 NLT, God says, 'My thoughts are completely different from yours... My ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.' God always sees and understands more than we do so we can trust Him. Perhaps you are finding life tough to understand right now. Rather than blame God, ask Him to help you to see the bigger picture!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The mother of Jesus said...&quot;They have no wine.&quot;' John 2:3 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Robert Matthew Van Winkle, better known by his stage name Vanilla Ice, has an interesting claim to fame. His single <i>Ice Ice Baby</i> was the first hip-hop single to reach the top of the charts here. It was memorable for one particular line: 'If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it.' Now, as great a rapper as he is, I doubt Mr Ice would arrive to put his words into action if you did have a problem. Jesus on the other hand (who, to the best of our knowledge, has never rapped) can be relied on to be there to solve any problem we might have. Jesus is our problem solver, our Mr Fix-it.</p>
<p>When problems occur, as they often do, don't panic, don't look for someone to blame, don't make excuses or flip your lid. Let Jesus know and hear Him say, 'I'll solve it'.</p>
<p>No problem is too huge, too small or even too ridiculous for Jesus: His mum asked Him to find more wine for a wedding, so He turned water into the finest vintage. His friend Martha came to Him because her brother had died, so Jesus brought him back to life again. A crowd of over five thousand people hadn't eaten all day, so Jesus borrowed a boy's packed lunch and fed the lot with it!</p>
<p>What's your problem? Let Jesus fix it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Gossip ruins friendships.' Proverbs 16:28 NCV<br /><br /><p>Everyone seems to love a bit of gossip. We only need to hear phrases like, 'Ooh, did you hear what she did...? You'll never guess what happened to...!' There's a whole industry built around celebrity gossip because in our time it's become acceptable and normal to gossip. Nobody seems to think there is anything wrong with it-until the gossip is about them, that is.</p>
<p>The book of Proverbs tells us how destructive gossip is: 'Gossip ruins friendships' (16:28 NCV); 'Gossips can't keep secrets, so avoid people who talk too much' (20:19 NCV); 'The words of a gossip are like tasty bits of food; people like to gobble them up' (26:22 NCV); '...gossip brings angry looks.' (25:23 NCV)</p>
<p>Sometimes we can kid ourselves that gossip is in other people's best interest. God is clear-He doesn't want us to gossip. 'Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving.' (Ephesians 5:4 ESV)</p>
<p>We're all in this together. God wants us to help each other avoid getting it wrong and start living right. Gossip isn't what's required-gentleness is: 'If someone in your group does something wrong, you who are spiritual should go to that person and gently help make him right again.' (Galatians 6:1 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Gently help make him right again.' Galatians 6:1 NCV<br /><br /><p>You see someone do something wrong and you react. Perhaps you 'tutt' and roll your eyes. Maybe you point and laugh unnaturally loud, urging others to do the same. Possibly you shoot them down with verbal abuse. Or you choose the fist option, launching into them physically for their little mishap.</p>
<p>The way you choose to react is bound to be learned behaviour (and learned bad behaviour at that). We're most often copying parents, friends or teachers who have reacted badly in the past.</p>
<p>God wants us to copy His style and gives us some great advice: 'If someone in your group does something wrong, you who are spiritual should go to that person and gently help make him right again.' Gently does it.</p>
<p>When we mess up, we can feel as fragile as glass-gutted, guilty, ashamed. What we need is the gentle approach, not a kick up the backside to get us back on track.</p>
<p>1 Peter 3:8-9 ESV tells us to '...have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. ...bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Gently help make him right again.' Galatians 6:1 NCV<br /><br /><p>Think of the word 'gentleness' and words like 'wishy-washy', 'indecisive', 'unassertive' or just plain 'wimpy' spring to mind, don't they? But gentleness is better described as 'quiet strength'. It's a comment on how you use your power, not a measure of how much power you have. The ultimate form of gentleness is found in Jesus. Hanging in excruciating agony, dying on the cross, Jesus had in His power the ability to call down angels from Heaven to get Him down, the power to annihilate all who had put Him there in an instant, but He chose not to use it. His decision to hold back that strength, to restrain all the power that was in His grasp, that's quiet strength, that's gentleness. Jesus used the power of love, never the love of power. He used His power not to harm but to save: 'For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned.' (John 3:17-18 NIV) Gentleness is a powerful force that helps, never destroys; a desire that no harm be done. Go about your day the gentle way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The righteous are guided and protected by the Lord...' Psalm 1:6 GNT<br /><br /><p>How does God speak to us? The R.I.G.H.T. way of course! We just have to make sure we're listening. Here's what I mean:</p>
<p><i>Rel</i><i>ationships:</i> Are you hanging out with Christians? Hebrews 13:7 NIV says, 'Remember your leaders who spoke the Word of God to you.' God will speak to us through the men and women who are leaders in church-so make sure you get around them so you can hear what He's saying.</p>
<p><i>Ideas</i>: Sometimes a good idea will just pop into our heads. Revelation 3:8 NLT, 'I have opened a door for you that no one can shut.' If it's God speaking He'll give you all you need to make that idea a reality.</p>
<p><i>Gifts</i>: God speaks to us when we use the gifts and talents He's given us. 1 Peter 4:10 says, 'Each one, as a good manager of God's different gifts, must use for the good of others the special gift he has received from God.' We'll discover more about God this way.</p>
<p><i>Hope</i>: Never think God has forgotten you. He never stops communicating with you. 1 Peter 1:13 CEV says, 'Be alert and think straight. Put all your hope in how kind God will be to you.'</p>
<p><i>Thoughts</i>: Switch your way of thinking into God's way of thinking, and you'll hear God. Romans 12:2 NLT says, 'Let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now remember what you were, my friends, when God called you.' 1 Corinthians 1:26 GNT<br /><br /><p>Jesus always saw the best in people. He didn't see people as losers, but as potential winners who'd lost their way. Jesus saw everyone He met through God's eyes; not as weeds, but as potential roses.</p>
<p>It brought out the best in them. Where others saw a woman with five failed marriages, Jesus saw a lady in need of forgiveness so she could go and help others. They saw a blind man, but Jesus looked at someone who would be able to help others to see. They saw a cripple, but Jesus pictured a man picking up his mat and walking away.</p>
<p>They saw Matthew as a nasty tax collector; Jesus saw a future disciple. They dismissed Zacchaeus as a thief; Jesus recognised a heart with the potential for generosity. His disciples looked down on a prostitute; Jesus saw the beauty of a grateful heart. Others saw an impulsive fisherman; Jesus saw the makings of a leader who could build His church. Onlookers watched Roman soldiers mocking as they pounded nails into human flesh; Jesus saw blind men who didn't know what they were doing, waiting for understanding.</p>
<p>When Jesus looks at you, He sees your potential, not your failure. Jesus looks for the best and brings out the best. Let Him bring out the best in you.</p>
<p>When Jesus sees the people you look at He doesn't see wasters, spongers, losers, emos, goths, thickos or nerds. Jesus sees simply the best! Will you let Him show you the best in others too?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Making the most of your time...' Ephesians 5:16 NAS<br /><br /><p>'It's wonderful to be young! Enjoy every minute of it. Do everything you want to do; take it all in. But remember that you must give an account to God for everything you do.' (Ecclesiastes 11:9 NLT)</p>
<p>It's been said that counting time is not as important as making time count. Charles M. Schwab was president of Bethlehem Steel Corporation and gave Ivy Lee, a consultant, an unusual challenge: 'Show me a way to get more things done with my time.' Schwab agreed to pay him anything within reason if Lee's suggestions worked. Lee wrote him this plan: 'Write down the most important tasks you have to do tomorrow. Number them in order of importance. When you arrive in the morning, begin at once on number one and stay on it until it is completed. Recheck your priorities, then begin with number two, then number three. Make this a habit every working day. Pass it on to those under you. Try it as long as you like, then send me your cheque for what you think it's worth.'</p>
<p>That one idea turned Bethlehem Steel into the biggest independent steel producer in the world within five years. Weeks after receiving the note, Schwab sent Lee a cheque for $25000, admitting it was the most profitable lesson he had ever learned. Try it for yourself. Most of all make sure you're 'making the most of your time.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we will hold to the truth in love...' Ephesians 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Father: <i>I want an explanation and I want the truth.</i></p>
<p>Son: <i>Make up your mind, dad, you</i><i> can</i><i>'</i><i>t have both.</i></p>
<p>Some people are so addicted to exaggeration that they can't tell the truth without lying. The Bible tells us to 'reject all shameful and underhanded methods. We do not try to trick anyone.' (2 Corinthians 4:2 NLT) We should speak the plain, unembellished truth, so people don't think there is anything 'between the lines...' (2 Corinthians 1:13 NLT) How truthful are you?</p>
<p>There are statements we instinctively disbelieve, like 'the cheque's in the post... the puppy won't be any trouble... I won't tell anybody.' Then there are 'lies so clever they sound like the truth.' (Ephesians 4:14 NLT) Sometimes it's hard to know whether someone is telling the truth or not. What about you? When people listen to you, are they left wondering if it's the truth? Can your words always be trusted?</p>
<p>Did you know, 'the Lord hates...a lying tongue'? (Proverbs 6:16-17 NLT) 'A witness who lies will not go free...' (Proverbs 19:9 NCV) So practice telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Try and learn this truth tongue twister (from T. Baird) as a reminder: 'Since truth is always true and only true can be; keep me, O Lord, as true to truth, as truth is true to Thee.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['As soon as they began singing...' 2 Chronicles 20:22 CEV<br /><br /><p>It doesn't matter where you are you have to get used to the weather changing. Cities like Melbourne are famous for wind, rain and sunshine... all in the same hour! We put away our winter woollies and get out the t-shirts as summer approaches, then it's bye-bye thongs and boardies as winter rolls around again.</p>
<p>We might talk a lot about our weather but still we accept seasons and adapt. A few extra layers and we're feeling toasty again in the winter chill, while another ice-cream helps us cool down in the summer sun.</p>
<p>Christians can have spiritual seasons too: highs and slumps. Spiritual highs can leave us feeling like we're touching Heaven and spiritual lows can leave us feeling we're down in the pits. Ecclesiastes 3: 1 NRS tells us, 'For everything there is a season', so don't be surprised when a spiritual slump comes along. Simply adapt!</p>
<p>The Bible lets us in on the best way up and out from any spiritual slump. All you need to do is warm up those vocal chords and sing. We're not talking karaoke here. Start praising God, from the tips of your toes to the top of your head. You won't always feel like it-that's why it's called 'the sacrifice of praise'. (Hebrews 13:15 NIV) But do it anyway. It brings a sense of God's power and presence like nothing else does. Hope rises in your soul, and it's impossible to stay down and defeated.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you will be My witnesses...' Acts 1:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>You could be forgiven for thinking 'testimony' means a lawyer reading out a 'last will and testimony' and who will inherit what. Instead, you should think more in terms of a courtroom drama where a witness to a crime gives testimony to what they've seen. Your Christian testimony is how you've seen Jesus make a difference in your life.</p>
<p>Here's a handy exercise to get your story straight in your head. Take a pen and paper and write underneath these four simple headings: 1. <i>What my life was like before I met Jesus</i>. 2. <i>How I realised I needed</i><i>Jesus</i>. 3. <i>How I committed my life to Jesus</i>. 4. difference Jesus has made in my life. Familiarise yourself with what you've written and then you'll always have a sort of script to pull from your head whenever anyone asks you why you're a Christian.</p>
<p>But of course, the longer you've been a Christian, the more stories you'll store up to tell of what God has done for you. Think about problems or crises or obstacles God has brought you through-how have you changed because of them? These are all testimonies of God's existence in your life. The best part is that nobody can argue with your story.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p><span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;>&amp;nbsp;'For He is always thinking about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 TLB </span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;><em>The noise is just too much to bear! And the constant stream of questions. There's too much running-one of them is bound to fall over and there's sure to be tears. It's just too hard to listen, let alone think! How on earth can anyone be expected to concentrate on a sermon with all this calling out and joining in and giggling, chitter-chatter. Enough is enough-it's time to get the kids out!</em></span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;>That's just an educated guess about what it would have been like the day the disciples tried to shoo away the children from Jesus; read Luke 18:15-17 for the scene as it is described in the Bible. </span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;>But be sure about one thing, Jesus is quick to scold the disciples for even thinking this kind of thing. 'Let the children come', He says as He makes time for their games and stories. 'The Kingdom belongs to these', He says, one child high on His shoulders, another under His feet. </span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;>The story shows that Jesus isn't just sermons from the pulpit; He's also fun. He can let loose with the kids; He makes time for the everyday. Through seeing Jesus break the heavy schedule to make time for the kids, we learn that God has lots of time for people. We learn that God the Father loves fun. When we start to think Christianity is always a serious business, remember that Jesus shows our loving Father loves the silly games and kids with runny noses. <br /></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why are we sitting here until we die?' 2 Kings 7:3 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In Bible times, people thought that if you so much as shared a park bench with a leper you could kiss your limbs goodbye. So lepers were left like bony rats begging for leftovers on the edge of town. In 2 Kings 7, there's the story of a whole city too scared to set foot outside their homes. The people are starving to death but nobody heads off to the supermarket for fear of snipers with bows and arrows. So, with no chance of scraps coming their way, the lepers up and off to the enemy. After all, there's no point sitting around waiting to die, right?</p>
<p>Our lepers are left speechless when they arrive at their destination. It's a ghost-town. Not a soul is around. God has evicted the bad guys. The lepers do the town, eating their fill and parading around in the best clothes. Buzzed up, they agree to go home to spread the good news.</p>
<p>Read the story for yourself and learn these valuable lessons from the lepers: (1)<i> God rewards</i> <i>action</i>. Had the lepers stayed where they were, everyone would've died of starvation. Only when they headed for the danger zone did they see God's saving hand. (2)<i> Shout God's goodness</i>. The lepers could've stayed and kept the knowledge of God's grace to themselves; instead they headed home to share what He had done.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that you may know that you have eternal life...' 1 John 5:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When ten-year-old Mary's mother died, she became 'mother of the house', caring for her father who worked the night shift at a local mine. One evening as she was packing his lunch, she slipped a Gospel booklet inside, hoping he'd find comfort after the loss of his wife.</p>
<p>At 1 am that night, an emergency whistle sounded telling the townspeople that miners had been trapped in a collapsed mine. Emergency workers worked through the night and finally broke through to a small cavern where they found the miners. Sadly, it was too late. All eight men had suffocated, including Mary's dad.</p>
<p>As the rescuers surveyed the scene they noticed that the men had died seated in a circle. Looking closer, they discovered that Mary's father was sitting with a small booklet in his lap, open to the last page where the plan of salvation was explained. On that page he had written a special message to her: 'My dear Mary, by the time you find this I'll be with your mother. I read your little book several times to the others while we waited to be rescued. Our hope is fading for this life-but not for the next. We did as the book told us and prayed. I love you, and one day we'll all be together in Heaven.'</p>
<p>Are you going to Heaven? If you're not sure, follow the directions on the '<i>Three Reasons You Need Jesus</i>' page in the back cover of this book.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Noah found favour with the Lord.' Genesis 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>You don't sell ice to a penguin. You don't advertise oil heaters in the tropics. And you certainly don't expect to make boat sales in the desert. Not, that is, unless your customer goes by the name of Noah!</p>
<p>'It was faith that made Noah hear God's warnings about things in the future that he could not see. He obeyed God and built a boat in which he and his family were saved.' (Hebrews 11:7 GNT)</p>
<p>Noah had never seen rain-in fact, neither had anyone else. He lived over 100 km from the nearest ocean. Even if he could learn to build a ship, how would he get it to water? And how about rounding up all those animals? For more than 100 years he was a laughingstock. But because he acted on a word from God, he saved himself and the world: '...Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.' (Genesis 6:22 NLT)</p>
<p>Credit to him for not thinking about it logically or listening to the scoffers. Credit to him for putting obedience over reason. Noah grew in God through a chisel and a hammer far more than he ever would through Bible study and discussions. It's possible to love someone without reading about them but it's impossible to love without listening to them. Jesus said, 'If you love Me, obey My commandments.' (John 14:15 NLT)</p>
<p>Don't just be a Bible-reader, be a Bible-doer. <i>Act</i> upon the word of God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 24:1-27:24, Matt 22:34-46, Ps 20, Pr 19:24-29<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Noah found favour with the Lord.' Genesis 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>So Noah leaves the ark behind and, lo! God speaks to him: <i>We've done the boat thing, son; now get your chisel out again, we're going to upsize to the Millennium Falcon!</i> </p>
<p>Actually, far from it. There are no more ark-sized tests of faith for Noah-God just gave him the green light to get on with enjoying normal life: '...Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth... Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.' (Genesis 9:1-3 NIV)</p>
<p>Here's permission for Noah to do the things God designed him to do: 'Special hugs' with Mrs Noah. Time with the kids. Enjoy dinner. Excel in business. Work, rest and play.</p>
<p>See, God is bothered about the details of our lives. He doesn't just meet us for a bit of song-time on a Sunday, He meets us in the frantic corridors, He types with us in the chat-rooms. God wants to be part of the normal everyday stuff as much as the 'holy' Sunday stuff: 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives.' (Psalm 37:23 NLT) Don't hide the real 'you' under a religious mask-give God every detail of your life. God each day...helps you work, rest and play.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 27:25-30:26, Matt 23:1-12, Ps 112, Pr 20:1-4<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have finished my course...' 2 Timothy 4:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>The finishing line of the Sydney Marathon sorts the real athletes from the jokers dressed as emus. The Kenyan athlete is normally the one tearing through the tape, arms held high. The shelf-stacker from back o' Bourke who entered as a dare from his mate is usually the one whizzing past the line-in an ambulance!</p>
<p>Marathons are gruelling tests of endurance. Only the fittest, most focused athletes stay the course. The Bible describes the Christian life much like a marathon. Paul says, 'When Christ comes again, I can be happy because my work was not wasted. I ran the race and won.' (Philippians 2:16 NCV) Probably no-one ran a tougher marathon of life than Paul, and yet, he finished tearing through the tape, having accomplished everything God entrusted to him. Too many Christians start their race totally sold-out for God, but later walk off-track having lost their heart for Him. We should all live with the fear of that happening to us.</p>
<p>Athletes who stay the course train every day. Running is a lifestyle, not a hobby. We need to exercise our prayer legs every day. We need to watch our diet and choose healthy options to meditate on. We need to catch our breath in awe of how great God is. We need to make Jesus our lifestyle, not our Sunday jog.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, the one you love is sick.' John 11:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Prayer changes things.' So we say, and we like to see it as a two-way conversation between ourselves and God. But what about those times when it seems like He's wearing earplugs?</p>
<p>Classic example: Lazarus. 'Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus, Lord, the one you love is sick.' But Jesus doesn't arrive on the scene until the coffin and hearse have reached the cemetery! Mary and Martha must've felt like Jesus had the ear plugs in on their request. It seems like their brother is dead all because Jesus hasn't turned up.</p>
<p>Ever had that 'Jesus hasn't turned up' feeling? Well, the story shows that God doesn't neatly fit into our time schedules. The miracle does happen and Lazarus is pulled from death's grip-but not until God's appointed time. When God doesn't snap His fingers at our insistence, do we wonder what's going on? Revelation 8:1-4 NCV tells us 'There was silence in Heaven...[and] another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden pan...with the prayers of all God's...people. The angel put this offering...before the throne. The smoke...went up...to God with the prayers of God's people.'</p>
<p>Far from not listening, here we're told that God hushes the whole of Heaven to hear one prayer from His people. Angels zip it when you pray! Is God listening? Yes-God and the whole of Heaven.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He was faithful to God, who appointed Him...' Hebrews 3:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>'Staying faithful' is more than just being reliable, more than just turning up to school or work on time. It means you can be depended on to keep all your promises. Keeping that date with your needy mate even though you've had a better offer is being faithful. Handing over some hard-earned cash to charity rather than shopping for a new wardrobe is being faithful. Respecting the old-timers at church is being faithful.</p>
<p>Jesus said: 'Love your neighbour as you love yourself.' (Matthew 22:39 GNT) You can't completely love God if you're not trying to love His people. Colossians 3:17 NKJ says, '...whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord...'</p>
<p>You wouldn't want to make Jesus ashamed because you're spouting off how great He is with your mouth, but trashing His name by the things you're doing, would you? Faithfulness equals consistency. Don't make someone a promise if you know you can't keep it. Don't take on stuff until you know you can be trusted with it.</p>
<p>Being reliable is higher up God's list of priorities than being talented. God always gives us the 'trustworthy test' before He gives us the spotlight. If you can deal with the mind-numbingly boring stuff, you can be trusted to deal with the superstar stuff. 'If you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?' (Luke 16: 12 NIV) Wanna be a big shot? Practice being small fries first.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Created in Christ Jesus to do good works...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Guess once you've made your peace with God you're free to sit around waiting for Heaven, eh? Not unless you want to make zero contribution to God's Kingdom. Not unless you want to make zero contribution to your own growth. Mother Teresa put it better: 'Where is God? Everywhere. How do we love God? He gives us the opportunity to do to others what we would like to do to Him, to put our love for Him in action: loving and serving Him in the distressing disguise of the poorest of the poor.'</p>
<p>Treating life like a games console means you pass your time entertaining yourself. But treating life as an opportunity to serve the poor means God's Kingdom moves further into your heart and this world. We don't serve to look good. Helping out at the local soup kitchen isn't the Christian equivalent of wearing the latest boutique hoodie. </p>
<p>We're not interested in the 'oohs' and 'aahs' of people; we're interested because we love God. Paul said, 'I'm not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ's servant.' (Galatians 1:10 NLT) Also, we're not doing something <i>for</i> God, we're looking out for His face in the faces of the poor. The centrepiece of Mark's Gospel has Jesus saying, 'I...came here not to be served, but to serve...' (Mark 10:45 NLT) When you serve, you find Jesus' heartbeat.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Out of weakness were made strong...' Hebrews 11:34 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'Samson and Jephthah, also...David and Samuel...who through faith subdued kingdoms...stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong...' (Hebrews 11: 32-34 NKJ) </p>
<p>Ok, Samson was he of hippy hair who could be depended on to open any tightly-screwed bottle top. And David was the one who could fire a mean chicken nugget at any giant in town. But Jephthah who? Samuel what?</p>
<p>Jephthah, as well as having a nightmare name to pronounce, was famous in the book of Judges for saving Israel from invaders. His mum was a prostitute and his step-brothers ran him out of town! Samuel was appointed God's chosen leader for Israel. He was one of the Old Testament's greatest prophets but sadly lacking in parenthood skills. Samson unfortunately had an eye for the wrong sort of girl and David had an affair with a married woman. All four were massive God-go-getters. And yet each one also came with serious weaknesses.</p>
<p>And so that verse says, 'Out of weakness [they] were made strong.' Do you come wrapped in imperfect packaging? Well, it shouldn't stop you becoming a massive God-go-getter. Whatever the issue, whatever the baggage, God still wants to work with you and through you-if you're up for it.</p>
<p>Out of your weakness, God wants to make you strong: 'My grace is all you need, for My power is greatest when you are weak...' (2 Corinthians 12:9 GNT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Did not our hearts burn within us?' Luke 24:32 NKJ<br /><br /><p>God talks when we walk-just look at the two followers on the road to Emmaus. Scared and disappointed, they head for home, fleeing the scene of the crime-Jesus' crucifixion. Earlier on they'd heard the rumours from other believers that Jesus had somehow come back to life. But Cleopas and his mate aren't buying it and instead run away.</p>
<p><i>Lesson one: God talks through His people</i>. If only Cleopas believed what the disciples were saying, he could've avoided the road <i>away</i> from the cross. God talks through believers; that's why it's important for you to go to church. Other Christians have what you need to stay near the cross.</p>
<p><i>Lesson two: God talks through the Bible</i>. Jesus came alongside them, not so much as a stranger-more as a Bible study leader. He took them on a whirlwind tour of Scripture pointing out all the prophecies of what the Saviour would go through. God talks through His Word, and that's why you need to read your Bible. God always points us to a verse that will strengthen us. But His hands are tied if we don't open the book to begin with.</p>
<p><i>Lesson</i> <i>three: God talks to our heart</i>. 'They said to each other, It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us...' (Luke 24:32 NCV) What sets your heart on fire? The inner city? Poor countries? Forgotten orphans? God is telling your heart His will for your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you think you are strong...be careful not to fall.' 1 Corinthians 10:12 NCV<br /><br /><p>Hack down the thistles and thorns of the garden and you'll see where this whole mess began. A man and a woman chose to act upon a lie rather than stand on God's Word. They swapped paradise for propaganda and lobbed us a legacy of selfishness. Selfishness shuts out God by trusting in lies. And that's where we come into it. We want to trust God but we have this impulse to look out for Number One. Unlike Adam and Eve, we need to be alert to the lie.</p>
<p>One of the killer lies is <i>independence</i>. We trust in our own moral muscle and our own self-assessment and think we're doing pretty well. The more you control, the less room God has to manoeuvre. Independence means we don't really need God. Independence says we can live on our own, by our own rules and manage just fine. That was the first lie of the garden. Adam and Eve made up a new rule: from now on, you <i>can</i> eat from the forbidden tree. It was the first step in their downfall.</p>
<p>Another whopper of a lie is <i>hopelessness</i>. Adam and Eve chose to believe the opposite of what God said. 1 Peter 5:6 says, 'God's powerful hand...will lift you up when the right time comes.' Hopelessness says the opposite, 'God could never use you. You're too wishy-washy.' Toss the lie. Trust the Lord.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you think you are strong...be careful not to fall.' 1 Corinthians 10:12 NCV<br /><br /><p>Picture those shoot-'em-up games that turn you into a blood-thirsty, crazed terminator. The 'lie' has you in its target and is poised to shoot you up. Just like the game, you think you're progressing through the levels with ease until - BAM! A new challenge saps your life.</p>
<p>The Bible warns us: 'Stand firm...with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.' (Ephesians 6:14-16 NIV)</p>
<p>The lie says, 'If it feels good, do it'. The truth says, 'Keep alert and pray. Otherwise temptation will overpower you.' (Matthew 26:41 NLT) The lie says, 'Why shouldn't I have it?' Righteousness says, 'Be careful and guard against all kinds of greed. Life is not measured by how much one owns.' (Luke 12:15 NCV) The lie says, 'Are you going to let them get away with that?' Peace says, 'Do not repay anyone evil for evil... If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.' (Romans 12:17-18 NIV)The lie says, 'Does God really love you?' Faith says, '...nothing can separate us from His love.' (Romans 8:38 NLT)</p>
<p>Trust the Lord, toss the lie.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Having loved His own...He loved them to the end.' John 13:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In a busy hospital emergency room, an elderly gentleman was waiting to have stitches removed from his hand. He said, 'I'm in a hurry, nurse. I have an appointment in an hour.' As the line of patients ahead of him moved slowly, he kept looking anxiously at his watch. Knowing he'd never make his appointment, the nurse led him to an examination room, checked his vital signs and evaluated the condition of his wound. Seeing it was well healed, she consulted with one of the doctors and got clearance to remove his sutures and re-dress his wound.</p>
<p>She asked, 'Are you hurrying to another doctor's appointment?' He said, 'No, I'm on my way to have breakfast with my wife at the nursing home.' She asked about his wife's health and learned she was a victim of Alzheimer's disease. 'Will she be upset if you're late?' The old man told her she hadn't recognised him in five years. Surprised, the nurse asked, 'And you still go to see her every morning, although she doesn't know who you are?' The old man smiled, patted her hand and replied, 'Oh, yes. She doesn't know who I am, but I still know who she is!'</p>
<p>Sometimes you may forget about Jesus, but He never forgets you. Sometimes you may not even recognise that He is there, but He never leaves you. Sometimes you may think He doesn't care, but He never stops loving you with an inconceivable, unconditional love. Don't miss out on knowing Jesus that way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The words that I speak to you are...life.' John 6:63 NKJ<br /><br /><p>How many times have you thought or said, 'Reading the Bible's boring!' Jesus said, 'The words that I speak to you are...life.' That means we're not just meant to read or listen to God's words in the Bible, we're meant to react and interact with them. Here are four ways that will transform your Bible reading from boring to brilliant:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Reflect.</i> When you read your Bible, look for something that really stands out to you. It may just be one word or a whole sentence or a big chunk. Whatever stands out to you, reflect on it and read it over and over. The more you reflect, the more God will reveal.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Memorise.</i> We can all recite the lyrics to our favourite pop songs, quote our favourite films, even recall advert slogans. But how much of the Bible do you know without looking? Hebrews 4:12 NLT says, 'For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword.' Learn God's words. Carry them around in your head and in your heart and you will see that power at work.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Question.</i> Don't just ask, 'What is God saying?' but 'What is He saying <i>to me</i>?' Hear God speak to you personally.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Transform.</i>Turn the information into transformation. Do something about what you've read. James 1:25 NCV says: '...those who carefully study God's perfect law that makes people free, and...obey what God's teaching says...will be made happy.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Humble yourselves...and He will lift you up.' James 4:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Dr Diva can sound so much more appealing than Miss or Mr Humble. Oh, yes! Give me fame, give me glory, let me be adored, make me brilliant, talented but cool; attractive, charming, a pin up-yes, give me all these things and more. If there's a choice, chances are we're picking the Diva life!</p>
<p>But God says, 'Humble yourselves.' Yes! Humility is on God's agenda for you, not 'diva-ility'. It's a heart that says, 'less of me, God, and more of You; let me be last and others first, give me sacrifice, endurance, second place-as I put You and Your way before me and my way!'</p>
<p>Now, if this were a boxing match with diva attitude in the red corner and humility in the blue, you'd be putting your bets on the red corner to win. Diva sounds so much more powerful, in control, always ready with a surprise punch. Humility sounds like a weak and pathetic pushover, a loser with a capital L!</p>
<p>So why does God tell us, 'Humble yourselves'? Does He want all His followers to be weak individuals who get walked over? No! The Bible says, 'Humble yourselves...and [God] will lift you up'. Get a spiritual piggy-back from the creator of the universe, have the Almighty lift you up on to His shoulders and you will see God do 'immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.' (Ephesians 3:20 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...but if it dies...' John 12:24 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Does life just feel 'blah' at the moment? Are you struggling to find purpose to your day? Do things just seem pointless? Is your situation causing you to feel hopeless? Sometimes life gets tough, things happen that leave us feeling confused, alone, empty and in pain. It feels like the sunshine of happiness has been covered by a big black cloud of doom and despair.</p>
<p>Don't allow yourself to become consumed in the misery of the moment, believing it will last forever. Take comfort, get courage from Jesus. He reached a point in His life where everything felt 'too much' for Him too. Matthew 26:39 NLT says Jesus prayed: 'My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from Me.' Life felt so difficult for Jesus, but He went on to pray, 'Yet I want Your will to be done, not Mine.' He knew it's better to trust God, not feelings.</p>
<p>Even when staring death in the face Jesus knew God would bring a greater good out of such a painful tragic time. God promises to do the same for you. Romans 8:26-8 NLT says: 'And the Holy Spirit helps us in our distress. For we don't even know what we should pray for, nor how we should pray. But the Holy Spirit prays for us...and...pleads for us believers in harmony with God's own will. And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He understands how weak we are...' Psalm 103:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Psalm 103 is like a great big hug, or like putting on a brand new designer outfit-it makes you feel great! It lets you know all the massive stuff God has done, is doing and will do for you. And here's the best bit-get to verse 14 and you hear: 'He understands how weak we are.'</p>
<p>Psalm 103 says God doesn't have moments of delusion about us. He knows exactly what we are like yet still chooses to lavish on us His best. God tells us, even though we have weaknesses, even though we all deserve to be punished, even though we are only 'dust': 'He forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases...fills my life with good things...is merciful and gracious...slow to get angry and full of unfailing love... He has not punished us for all our sins, nor does He deal with us as we deserve... For He understands how weak we are; He knows we are only dust... the love of the LORD remains forever with those who fear Him.' (Psalm 103:3-17 NLT)</p>
<p>Thanks to Psalm 103 we know God sings about us: 'You're amazing, just the way you are.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Reading the book of Proverbs you could be forgiven for thinking that this book was written in order to provide clever sayings for desk calendars! However it's clear from the first few verses that it was written for a more important reason than that.</p>
<p>The key theme of Proverbs is wisdom or the ability to live life skilfully. It is one of the most practical books in the Old Testament part of the Bible. Solomon wrote over 3000 inspired instructions covering practically every aspect of human life: silliness and understanding, pride and humility, vengeance and justice, laziness and initiative, poverty and wealth, enemies and friends, lust and love, anger and anxiety, masters and servants, life and death. Only some of his wise sayings remain in the book of Proverbs.</p>
<p>It's more than a book on wisdom; if you choose, it can also be a book on foolishness. Every wise course of action is contrasted with a foolish course of action. God wants you to get the best out of life so here's a tip for today: read through Proverbs with a notebook and pen. Make a list of wise choices and a list of foolish choices and decide today to follow the instructions that give you the ability to live life skilfully.</p>
<p>Several wise people have said: 'Learn from the mistakes of others-you can never live long enough to make them all yourself.' Proverbs is like a life-line from God showing you the best way to avoid making the worst mistakes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>On YouTube there is a remembrance picture video of eight teenagers who committed suicide because they were being bullied. One of the comments underneath says, 'I was crying cause all these kids were harassed and bullied and they couldn't turn to anyone cause they thought the problem would become worse. All those beautiful boys/girls died because of harassment.' There are so many others who have believed their only solution to their difficult situation was to end their life. They have been left without hope for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Proverbs tells us God wants to 'add length to [our] life.' So what do we do if we are consumed with the thought that we cannot live anymore? What do we tell a friend who's feeling like this? Where is the life-line to help?</p>
<p>David once had to flee for his life to Goliath's hometown. Talk about mega-trouble! The whole town was out for revenge. He wrote this about it: '...let all who are discouraged take heart... I prayed to the Lord, and He answered me, freeing me from all my fears. Those who look to Him for help will be radiant with joy; no shadow of shame will darken their faces... For the angel of the Lord guards all who fear Him, and He rescues them... Oh, the joys of those who trust in Him!' (Psalm 34:2-8 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Be afraid, be very afraid!' This phrase was first uttered in the 1986 film <i>The Fly</i>, starring Jeff Goldblum (as Brundle) and Geena Davis (as Quaife). Brundle is a brilliant but eccentric scientist experimenting with teleportation. Before long, his experiments begin to go badly wrong and he starts to turn into an insect. 'Don't be afraid,' he says. Quaife responds with the famous line: 'No. Be afraid. Be very afraid.'</p>
<p>Over time these words have become a catchphrase for all things scary. Even fairgrounds use it to advertise the latest crazy ride to entice thrill seekers. When we think of the fear we think: 'Be afraid, be very afraid'!</p>
<p>So what is the Bible trying to tell us when we read, 'The fear of the Lord adds length to life'? Is God telling us we need to be scared out of our tiny minds in order to get a good long life on earth? 1 John 4:16 tells us that, 'God is love.' How can we 'be afraid, very afraid' of love? Surely God doesn't want us quivering in our boots, knees knocking, white with fear at the mere mention of His name?</p>
<p>Not at all! But He is saying, 'Have so much respect for Me and trust Me in such a way that the most important thing to you in everything you do is a desire to follow My instructions for your life.' That's a right fear of the Lord.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we looked at what it means to fear God and discovered it's not about shaking in our boots or feeling a tornado of terror whirl around our inner being. It's about 100% respecting and trusting God. Our deepest desire should be that our words, thoughts and actions follow God's instructions for our lives-so we get God's best. Sounds good, but how is that achievable? Here's your whistle-stop tour in <i>How To Live Fearfully Right</i>:</p>
<p><i>First, stop acting like a know it all!</i>Ecclesiastes 11:5 NAS says, 'You do not know the path of the wind...how bones are formed in the womb...you do not know the activity of God.' Get over yourself: 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek His will...and He will direct your paths. Don't be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord and turn your back on evil. Then you will gain renewed health and vitality.'(Proverbs 3:5-8 NLT)</p>
<p><i>Secondly, realise it's not what you know but who you know that matters!</i> From the bottom of your boots to the top of your baseball cap, 'love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.' (Luke 10:27a NLT)</p>
<p><i>Thirdly, there's no couch potato attitude allowed!</i> Activate, don't vegetate! There should be no picking favourites-simply, 'Love your neighbour as yourself.'(Luke 10:27b NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>False teeth, bald head, poor eyesight, hearing aids-are these the things that spring to mind when you think about old age? And what do you think about old people? Do they annoy, irritate and bore you? Do you find you have no time for them? Do you think them unimportant, irrelevant?</p>
<p>When things become old and worn out we tend to want to throw them away. Rather than fixing or mending we want something that's new and shiny. If we are not careful, we can transfer our attitude about old things on to people. If we think 'old' means 'second hand, worn out, no use, out-dated' we can find ourselves treating people in the same way. Leviticus 19:32 NIV says, 'Show respect for the elderly and revere your God.'</p>
<p>Today, give yourself an attitude check-up. Do old people do your head in? Or are you seeing them as God sees them-something good to have in your life?</p>
<p>In his eighties, Arthur Rubinstein amazed audiences with his piano-playing skills. William Gladstone became Britain's Prime Minister for the fourth time in his eighties. John Wesley still preached every day, aged 88. Moses led Israel at 120. Caleb at 80 led his troops against an army of giants, and won. Two-thirds of the world's greatest works of art were accomplished by people over 65.</p>
<p>Give time to the grannys and grandpas of this world-who knows what good things they will bring into your life? There's only one way to find out!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Thus shall the man be blessed...' Psalm 128:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Have you ever woken up on the 'wrong side of bed'? Nothing seems right and you're all grumpy and disgruntled? By lunchtime you wish you'd stayed in bed and so does everyone you come into contact with! You're like a bear with a sore head! At times like this, we need to shift our focus and look up instead of down. We need to turn to the God of the universe.</p>
<p>Psalm 128 is one of 15 psalms God's people sang as they travelled to Jerusalem during one of their many celebrations. These short songs would have turned any disgruntled bad attitudes around, by reminding them that God was their protector, peacemaker, restorer, guide. He was trustworthy, totally dependable.</p>
<p>In his book, <i>Step by Step</i>, Cliff Keeys says, 'Has anyone ever said to you, Surely you don't believe all that Bible stuff-I thought you were an intelligent person! I've heard it many times but I always respond by saying that what I do understand in the Bible is very important to me and the rest I will work my way through-into Heaven and beyond! After all I haven't figured out how a car or a TV or a computer or an iPod works yet but I still enjoy what they do for me!'</p>
<p>You may not fully understand what God is like or exactly who He is, but you can enjoy being His child. Thank Him today for all He has given and done for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Good people live right...' Proverbs 20:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>Read Psalm 25. It describes a person who's chosen the right road, yet not found it easy to walk. In the first ten verses we learn five things about the person who prays:</p>
<p>(1) <i>They know where to go for help:</i> 'To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul...' (v1) Others can help us and we often go for help everywhere else before God but only He can truly help and sustain us.</p>
<p>(2) <i>They know who to trust</i>: 'In You I trust...do not let me be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me...' (v2) Love your enemies, because God does. Whatever others say or do to you, they will be answerable to God. Pray for them, give them to God, then move on.</p>
<p>(3) <i>They know what prayer's all about</i>: 'Show me Your ways, O Lord, teach Me your paths.' (v4) When we pray we change. We get some of God's heart, we learn His ways, we find out who He is and we realise our need of Him. It's one of the main tools God uses to transform us. When we pray life, choices and paths become clear. At that point we have a choice whether to go deeper with God or to abandon it and refuse to change.</p>
<p>(4) <i>They know why they're saved.</i> '...According to Your love remember me...' (v7) We can't get to God because of what we've done; it's all about His grace and love!</p>
<p>(5) <i>They know prayer works</i>. 'He guides the humble in what is right...' (v9) When you can't see the way forward, pray. God will show you one step at a time.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be kind and compassionate...forgiving each other...' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>A counsellor writes: 'We have all been wounded. Who wounds us? Those we love and those who love us. When we feel rejected, abandoned, abused, manipulated or violated it's usually by people close to us: our parents, our friends...our teachers, our pastors. This is what makes forgiveness so difficult.'</p>
<p>But forgiveness, however difficult it might seem, is something that God wants for and from us: 'Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of malicious behaviour. Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.' (Ephesians 4:31-32 NLT) 'How can I forgive her? Do you know what she did?', you might shout back. There are always two sides to forgiveness: giving and receiving.</p>
<p>John 3:16-17 NCV tells us that Jesus came to save us and forgive us: 'God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son so that whoever believes in Him may not be lost, but have eternal life. God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through Him.'</p>
<p>Do you know what it is like to be forgiven? Have you received God's forgiveness? Put your trust in Jesus today and ask Him to forgive you and He will. Once we've received forgiveness we want to pass it on to others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They praised [God]...because the foundation...was laid.' Ezra 3:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When Solomon was king he built a massive temple for God using the best of everything. He created a spectacular masterpiece that took seven years to build. Sadly, years later it was totally wiped out by the Babylonians. Then came a time later in history when God's people wanted to rebuild it, which was no easy task. They didn't wait till it was finished to start celebrating, 'When the builders completed the foundation of the Lord's Temple...all the people gave a great shout, praising the Lord...' (Ezra 3:10-11 NLT) There was still loads more work to be done but the people praised God. Why? Because they wanted to celebrate God from the beginning; they wanted to say thanks from the start, not waiting until the end!</p>
<p>When exams loom and you're up to your neck in a pile of books, with endless amounts of work still to be done and your revision list seemingly endless, it's hard to praise God. All you want to do is cry and shout, 'Help!' You want to make all the work go away-not thank God for it!</p>
<p>But when we praise God from the beginning, three things happen. One, we trust God to get us through. Two, we receive strength from God and it makes the task easier. Three, our outlook changes and what seems impossible becomes possible. When you praise God in the early stages, you work better and the job gets done quicker.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They praised [God]...because the foundation...was laid.' Ezra 3:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When Solomon was king he built a massive temple for God using the best of everything. He created a spectacular masterpiece that took seven years to build. Sadly, years later it was totally wiped out by the Babylonians. Then came a time later in history when God's people wanted to rebuild it, which was no easy task. They didn't wait till it was finished to start celebrating, 'When the builders completed the foundation of the Lord's Temple...all the people gave a great shout, praising the Lord...' (Ezra 3:10-11 NLT) There was still loads more work to be done but the people praised God. Why? Because they wanted to celebrate God from the beginning; they wanted to say thanks from the start, not waiting until the end!</p>
<p>When exams loom and you're up to your neck in a pile of books, with endless amounts of work still to be done and your revision list seemingly endless, it's hard to praise God. All you want to do is cry and shout, 'Help!' You want to make all the work go away-not thank God for it!</p>
<p>But when we praise God from the beginning, three things happen. One, we trust God to get us through. Two, we receive strength from God and it makes the task easier. Three, our outlook changes and what seems impossible becomes possible. When you praise God in the early stages, you work better and the job gets done quicker.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...have faith that God exists and rewards those who seek Him.' Hebrews 11:6 GNT<br /><br /><p>Pastor Ruth from Uganda loves to tell her life story. She prayed hard and was miraculously healed of AIDS-not just HIV, but full-blown AIDS. 'If God can do it for me, He can do it for others too,' she says. Since then, she has seen God heal 54 more people of AIDS-and she's expecting to see more.</p>
<p>Christopher Pylant's parents refused to believe there was no hope for their son who'd been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour, even when neurosurgeon Ben Carson told them, 'I'm sorry I couldn't help your son.' They never wavered, saying, 'God's going to heal our son. We're standing on His promise.' For three days, little Christopher was comatose, but his eyes were focusing and his physical movements improved. Following another scan Carson re-operated, and after removing the cancerous mass in layers and cleaning out the crevices, there it was-a healthy brain stem, distorted, but intact! Taking their son home a month later, his parents and the doctor thanked God together for a miracle. </p>
<p>Come to God today, He still does  miracles so don't be afraid to ask: 'Anyone who wants to come to Him must believe that God exists and that He rewards those who sincerely seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NLT)</p>

<title><![CDATA[Labels of Love]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[labels-of-love]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Everyone who loves is born of God...' 1 John 4:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Don't you just love designer labels?  But what about labels that we'd never choose? Labels that are forced on us or, worse still, we stick on others? Labels like 'nobody', 'loser', 'fatty', 'waster' or 'nerd'? Recently, a 12-year-old boy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hanged himself. Why? Because the next day was his first day at a new school, he was overweight and he dreaded being taunted by others. Those labels literally scared him to death.</p>
<p>God wants you to wear and hand out the label of love: 'Let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.' When we choose to love not just the people we like but everybody, we get to know God more. We understand better how much He loves us. We accept the labels He gives us: 'precious', 'beautiful', 'overcomer', 'priceless', 'prince' or 'princess'. In light of these, no one else's opinion matters. God's labels of love are true.</p>
<p>It's easier to label people than love them. It's easier to make jokes about people than build them up and encourage them. The Bible says, '... anyone who does not love does not know God-for God is love.' (1 John 4:8 NLT) Remember today that the greatest gift you have to give others-and receive yourself!-is God's love.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...live your lives as strangers here...' 1 Peter 1:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever feel like you don't fit? You're out of place, uncomfortable in your surroundings? Well, get this-that's exactly how God says you're meant to feel. In the Bible He says: '...live your lives as strangers here.'</p>
<p>When we live as a follower of Jesus, our real home is Heaven. This means sometimes we will feel a bit lost or out of place here on earth. That's why Jesus says, 'Don't be troubled. You trust God, now trust in Me. There are many rooms in My Father's home... When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with Me where I am.' (John 14:1-3 NLT)</p>
<p>So have confidence today, knowing Jesus is right now preparing your real home, the place where you going to spend forever. It's better than you can imagine and when you get there you'll know you've arrived-you'll know you're home.</p>
<p>In the meantime we need to live God's way: 'You were chosen to tell about the wonderful acts of God, who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light... you are like foreigners and strangers in this world. I beg you to avoid...evil... People who do not believe are living all around you and might say that you are doing wrong. Live such good lives that they will see the good things you do and will give glory to God...' (1 Peter 2: 9-12 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Turn...me, and I shall be turned...' Jeremiah 31:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>If you are feeling like a victim, read this: 'I don't want to feel this way anymore. I thought if my pain touched their lives, I'd feel better. I didn't. I thought by holding it over their heads, I'd feel better. I didn't. I thought by telling everyone what they'd done to me, I'd feel better. I didn't; it only cost me friends and kept the pain alive. I thought if they acknowledged how wrong they've been, I'd feel better. They didn't, so I felt worse. I thought if I could understand why I pick such relationships, I'd feel better. So I read books and talked with counsellors. But that didn't work, because then I uncovered other issues I didn't have the emotional energy to deal with. I thought time would make me feel better. It helped, but it didn't heal, because there were still too many things that triggered old memories. I thought by moving to a new house in a new city and getting a new job, I'd feel better. I didn't; I only changed addresses, not what was going on inside me. Finally, I did two things that worked; not overnight, but gradually, patiently, consistently as I kept doing them, they worked. First, I decided to forgive-and keep forgiving until the past no longer controlled me. Secondly, I cried out to God, Turn...me, and I shall be turned. He answered my prayer. My perceptions began to clear and my heart began to heal...at last, getting well meant more...to me than remaining a victim.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Give a crown of beauty for ashes...' Isaiah 61:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>We've all experienced that all-too-familiar reddening of the skin that swells to a sore little white bump! Zits! Sometimes it feels like they choose the worst moments to rear their ugly heads, but what can you do? Stick a paper bag over your head and hide away from the rest of the world?</p>
<p>When problems come along God doesn't want you to bury your head in the sand like an ostrich. He wants you to turn to Him, face the facts and express your pain. </p>
<p>Be honest-talk to God about what's really going on, just like David in the Bible did: 'How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart?' (Psalm 13:2 NIV) The first step to healing, resolving difficulties and problem-solving is letting God in.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's easy to think that our problems are not important to God, that He's not interested or that our stuff doesn't matter to Him. But read Isaiah 61:1-3 NLT and you discover the truth of how much God cares for you: God sent Jesus 'to bring good news to the poor...comfort the broken-hearted and to announce that captives will be released and prisoners will be freed...and...give beauty for ashes, joy instead of mourning, praise instead of despair.' Let God turn your ashes into beauty.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Check this out: 'I no longer call you servants; because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead I have called you friends; for everything that I learned from My Father I have made known to you.' (John 15:15 NIV) Jesus describes the difference between being a friend or a servant by talking about sharing inside information. David said, 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him...' (Psalm 25:14 KJV) God will share things with those who are intimate with Him that He won't share with others. When you see somebody who's focused in the confusion and cool when the heat is on, they might know a secret; shared with them by a Friend.</p>
<p>When God tells you to do certain things He's not trying to make your life hard. No, He's setting you up for a blessing. Listen: 'I wish their hearts would always respect Me and that they would always obey My commands so that things would go well for them...' (Deuteronomy 5:29 NCV) On the other end of anything God asks you to do, is the promise 'so that things would go well for you.' Don't be surprised if sometimes God expects things of you that: (a) He doesn't require of others (b) He won't explain and you can't understand (c) when you've obeyed, you won't immediately see the benefits. But if you're convinced that God has a unique plan for your life and loves you unconditionally, you'll throw yourself on Him in complete trust, knowing that in the end it will 'go well' for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about becoming God's friend, you must listen for His voice.</p>
<p>One evening two old friends got together. One told the other that he could hear 18 different kinds of crickets in the garden. The other was amazed; he'd lived around there for years and never even heard one! The difference was that his friend was a professor who studied insects and who had learned to tell the difference between 200 different cricket calls. How awesome is that! Looking back, the first friend wrote, 'I suddenly understood that a person must <i>want</i> to hear, and <i>learn</i> to hear, and there were many sounds I was not hearing.' It's not enough just to want to become God's friend and hear His voice, we need to learn what it sounds like.</p>
<p>God speaks in loads of ways and one of those is through people. The problem is, when you only hear from God through someone else it's easy to ignore or doubt what you've heard. But when you know God is speaking right to you personally, you can't just ignore it. Jesus said, 'His sheep follow him because they know his voice.' (John 10:3-4 NIV) Even the most ordinary people in the Bible did great things because they clearly knew God's voice when He spoke. Are you willing to be God's friend and listen for His voice?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>We all want friends. They're an important part of our life. Yes, friends may make us mad sometimes, but we still wouldn't be without them, would we?</p>
<p>A friend is someone we know, we like and we trust. But friendship doesn't just happen over night; you have to put time and effort in. If you want a friend you have to be a friend. Being God's friend is as easy as 1, 2, 3:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Get to know Him.</i> We discover who God is through the Bible. The Bible is like a long love letter from God to you. In it, He tells you all about Himself, what He likes and doesn't like, what He does and doesn't do, what makes Him laugh and what makes Him cry. On every page He tells you something about who He is-making it easy to get to know Him.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Start to like Him.</i> Once you know God, you want to talk to Him and listen to Him, then you can't help but like Him. You'll realise how amazing and powerful He is and become overwhelmed and captivated by His love.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Begin to trust Him.</i> Learn to trust God one step at a time. Start by doing one thing you know He wants you to do, like forgiving someone who's hurt you, then wait and see what happens. You'll discover that God's way is always the best way and that He always has your best interests at heart and the right answer for your situation.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There's a guy in the Bible called Habakkuk (don't suppose there's anyone you know by that name, is there?) He was friends with God but became really angry about his life and disappointed with God for not doing anything to help.</p>
<p>Now, he didn't pretend everything was fine and nice. He told God straight: 'How long, O Lord, am I to cry for help, but You will not listen? I cry out...There's violence!...why do you watch wickedness? Destruction and violence are in front of me. Quarrels and disputes arise...justice is never carried out...' (Habakkuk 1:1-4 GWT)</p>
<p>Amazingly, God never tells Habakkuk off for being angry. Instead, He listens and talks with Habakkuk about it. At that moment in time God didn't do anything to change the awful circumstances Habakkuk was in. But something did change-Habakkuk himself.</p>
<p>By being honest with God, Habakkuk's opinion changed. Instead of being angry and disappointed with life and God, he started to feel hopeful and realised that God had got it sorted. Even though life is still difficult, Habakkuk says, 'I will truly find joy in God, who saves me. The Lord Almighty is my strength. He makes my feet like those of a deer. He makes me walk on the mountains.' (Habakkuk 3: 18-19 GWT) Being God's friend is about being honest with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God...turned the curse into a blessing...' Deuteronomy 23:5 NCV<br /><br />Ever felt like you wanted the ground to open up and swallow you? The worst thing that could ever possibly happen has just happened. You think it's all over!<br />Jon Gordon writes, 'I lost my job in 2001...the company sank faster than the Titanic...I thought it was the worst event of my life. I was two months away from bankruptcy. I'd a wife, two children, a mortgage, no health insurance, and very little savings. I was a payslip away from losing it all and...I had to make some important decisions. Eventually they led to the work I now do as a writer, consultant and speaker. I went from Fired to Fired-up! My lay-off led to my life's mission...what I thought was the worst...led to the best.'<br />In Genesis 50, Joseph's brothers are convinced he's going to kill them for ruining his life. But instead, Joseph says to them: 'Don't be afraid of me. Am I God, that I can punish you? You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.' (Genesis 50:19-20 NLT)<br />In Jeremiah 29:11 NLT God says, 'For I know the plans I have for you...plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.' Therefore no matter what anyone does or says to you, you can guarantee that, He will turn 'the intended curse into a blessing because the Lord your God loves you.'

<introtext><![CDATA['...even though he did not know where he was going...' Hebrews 11:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Dr Martin Luther King Jr said, 'Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.'</p>
<p>Case in point: Abraham. Hebrews 11:8 NKJ tells us that Abraham 'went out, not knowing where he was going.' Abraham was told to leave his home for a far-off land. It was faith that got his feet moving up the staircase, without revealing the details of his destiny.</p>
<p>Genesis 12:2 NKJ has God telling Abraham, 'I will make you a great nation.' Err, yup, just one problem: he doesn't have one leaf on the family tree, let alone a family branch, let alone a nation!</p>
<p>After twenty years of nothing happening, Abraham takes a few steps backward on the staircase of faith and produces Ishmael, a son born outside of marriage. This part of the story shows that sometimes we get it wrong before we get it right. If he'd just waited, his faith would have produced Isaac, a son to his wife. Impatience is a disaster waiting to happen unless you learn to trust God's timescale.</p>
<p>Like Abraham, we need to walk in faith, which means keep on moving forward under God's direction, not backward. Which way are you headed on the staircase of faith?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...because You say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Know what the ultimate test is? The Lordship test. Simon Peter passed this test by obeying a command that seemed to make no sense at all. Jesus said to him, 'Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch. Simon answered, Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets. When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.' (Luke 5:4-6 NIV).</p>
<p>Even though we've seen God do so much in our lives, it's still so easy to catch ourselves thinking that we know best. Especially when we think experience has proved us right. For example, when we've tried something time and time again and feel like giving up. When Jesus says 'stick at it', it's easy to think: 'Haven't you seen what happened? It's just not working!'</p>
<p>This was early days in Jesus and Peter's relationship. It would have been easy for Peter to think: 'Hang on, I've been a fisherman all my life. What can this preaching carpenter teach me about catching fish?' But he didn't. He said: 'Because you say so...' First Peter tried fishing alone and failed. Next he tried it with Jesus and succeeded. Same fisherman. Same boat. Same nets. What changed? He was willing to do it God's way! Passing the Lordship test means trusting that Jesus knows best even when your experiences or circumstances say otherwise.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 2:1-24, Acts 9:20-30<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Because You say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>You don't imagine Mal Meninga's half-time talks sound much like this: 'We're 22-14 down, boys. So we may as well give up. Let's admit defeat and we can all go grab a latte.' Yeah right!</p>
<p>Winners never give in, right? Wrong. God asks us to give in. God asks us to lay down our dreams and ambitions to Him. If we want to make our life count we must first submit ourselves to God. William Booth made his life count-he started a worldwide movement drumming up Christians to love and live with the poorest people. It became <i>The Salvation Army</i>. He said, 'The greatness of a man's power is in the measure of his surrender.' In other words, the most important step of his life was not opening his first church or setting foot abroad, it was the moment he chose, in the quiet of his heart, to give up his own plans for his life and take up God's plans instead.</p>
<p>Eventually we all surrender to something. Some surrender to God; others surrender to money. Some give in to God; others give in to fear. Some submit to God; others submit to lust. Some hold out for God; others hold onto their ego. You're free to choose who or what you will lay down. But only Christ will bring true freedom in exchange for your surrender.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Because You say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever tried to hold on to something really wriggly-like a hyperactive hamster? Or slippery-like a frightened frog? It's practically impossible! So why do you think you can keep the people or circumstances of your life tightly in your grip? LET GO! Really, go ahead: surrender it to God. You'll be amazed at how much more energy you'll have, and how much simpler life will be. Once you make the choice to surrender it to God, those difficult days will soon seem like a distant memory. A Bible expert called Tozer once wrote: 'Father, my cowardly heart fears to give up its toys. I cannot part with them without inward bleeding, and I do not try to hide from You my terror of the parting. I come trembling, but I do come. Please root from my heart those things which I have cherished so long and which have become a very part of my living self, so that You may enter and dwell there without a rival.' So, you say, 'Surrender what?'</p>
<p>(1) Your reputation! What good is 'street cred' compared to 'God cred'? Find your security and your identity in Him.</p>
<p>(2) Your plans! Sure, think ahead, but be ready for God to rearrange things and take you along a new path. Nothing this side of Heaven is permanent, including relationships. Enjoy the time you have with your mates and your loved ones, but avoid the temptation to get clingy.</p>
<p>(3) Your stuff! If your attention is occupied with the stuff you own, you aren't fully available for God. No, you're still clinging to minor things. Stop. Let go! You're cluttering the awesome life God has made possible for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God, You have taught me since I was young.' Psalm 71:17 NCV<br /><br /><p>'God, You have taught me since I was young. To this day I tell about the miracles You do.' (Psalm 71:17 NCV) When God created a movement to tell the world about His wonders, you know who He chose to kick it all off? Youth.</p>
<p>Yes, God chose young people, like you, to do the most important job ever-tell the world about Jesus. Some of the disciples were raggedy kids from poor backgrounds. All were inexperienced and uncultured. Few had travelled beyond their own country. They lived in an insignificant part of the world under a corrupt government. They argued and bickered about trivial things. Most of them had jobs that didn't pay well. Some worked like corrupt gangsters, one was even a terrorist. Finally, they took off when the going got tough-not the best ending to three years of on-the-job training. Hardly the types to start a major world revolution, are they? And yet these inconsistent, bickering, shallow kids grew up to change the world. They became wise, loving and deeply committed followers of God.</p>
<p>Never let anyone say you're 'just a kid'. You're key personnel in the formation of God's movement.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Someone with a quick temper does foolish things...' Proverbs 14:17 NCV<br /><br /><p>Pulsing veins in the neck, red mist in front of the eyes: pressure points, we all have them. Detentions after school. Late buses. Annoying little brothers. Unreliable friends. You-must-be-joking homework. Those are pressure points. Stuff that knots up your muscles and turns your hands into fists. </p>
<p>There's no point trying to pretend we're always 100% 'harmony, hippy Harry'. In fact, anger is a natural emotion. Uncontrolled fury, however, is not. We need to find ways of managing our anger healthily.</p>
<p>1 Samuel 25 tells a story of David and his quick temper. Nabal, unreasonably, refuses to feed David and his soldiers. Something about the unfairness of the situation rattles David's insides, and he's all set for revenge. Only Abigail, Nabal's wife, saves the men from full-on bloodshed. Her reasoning, thankfully, speaks louder than heated emotions.</p>
<p>We too could do with a dose of sensible reasoning over bloodshed and carnage when it comes to our own pressure points. When a new top shrinks in the wash or a favourite game is crushed by a clumsy foot, then flying off the handle with harsh words will only explode the situation. Someone with a quick temper does foolish things. Don't be a fool for fights. Use your brain not your brawn. Think two steps ahead. Think about the consequences of uncontrolled anger.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will...be led...with peace...' Isaiah 55:12 NAS<br /><br /><p>'Trust the Lord with all your heart, and don't depend on your own understanding. Remember the Lord in all you do, and He will give you success. Don't depend on your own wisdom. Respect the Lord and refuse to do wrong.' (Proverbs 3:5-7 NCV) </p>
<p>Ever had that twinge of conscience when you were about to do something that it isn't quite right? Well, maybe it was the voice of God speaking deep down into you. Psalm 32:8 NCV backs this up: 'I will make you wise...show you where to go...and watch over you.' Left to our own devices, we'd choose the path that looks nicest, but sometimes isn't the best: 'There is a way that seems right...but its end is...death.' (Proverbs 14:12 ESV) </p>
<p>What does it look like? Having a drink? Getting into that car? It may all seem harmless enough, but what's it going to lead to? That uncertain feeling might not be nerves or weakness-it could be God grabbing your attention to danger.</p>
<p>Think of it like a footy match. When the players stay within the boundaries of the game, they're free to move about. But when there's trouble, or the ball goes out of play, the referee blows the whistle. A lack of peace could mean God is blowing the whistle on your boundaries.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let your eyes look straight ahead...' Proverbs 4:25 NKJ<br /><br /><p>You can understand why the Complain Brigade was moaning. It was hot-sizzling, in fact. You could fry eggs on your forehead in those temperatures! And it was dangerous: wild animals, predators, snakes. Did I mention how hot it was? At times it seemed they were destined to die out in that vast desert.</p>
<p>It seemed like they were getting nowhere. Hadn't they passed this particular rock two years ago? Were they just going round in circles? And the food! What they would give to feel a cool cucumber on their parched tongues. Or a bit of a change from the same old dish they'd been served for the last four decades. Did I mention how hot it was?</p>
<p>Only the old guy at the front, leading the way, seemed to be striding with any purpose; the rest dragged their feet, kicking at the sharp stones in the scorched sand. The Complain Brigade saw wilderness upon wilderness; whereas Moses saw a promised land. What's your perspective through the tough times? Do you see a wilderness-dry, vast and empty? Or do you see a promise from God?</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:25 NCV says, 'Keep your eyes focussed on what is right, and look straight ahead to what is good.' Take your eyes off the desert panoramic and fix them tunnel-vision on God's promises.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['What I feared has come upon me...' Job 3:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nick was a tough guy with a bad outlook. He worked on the railways. One night after all his fellow workers had gone home he accidentally locked himself in a refrigerated carriage. Worried that the temperature was below freezing, he yelled for help, but to no avail. The more he thought about his situation the colder he felt, until eventually he started shivering uncontrollably. Convinced he was dying, he wrote a letter to his family outlining what had happened. The next morning they found Nick's body. An autopsy revealed that he had indeed frozen to death. But the investigators discovered something puzzling. The carriage in which Nick was trapped was out of order and had been disconnected. The night he froze to death, the temperature in the boxcar was 16.1 degrees-just below room temperature. But because he expected to die, he lost the battle in his mind.</p>
<p>What you believe about your life is more important than what anyone else believes. Job said, 'What I feared has come upon me.' Be careful what you anticipate because negative expectations can become self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>God has promised to help you, but you get the deciding vote. Jesus said, 'Let it happen...just as you believe!' (Matthew 9:29 GNT) So get into agreement with God's Word and focus on His promises instead of your problems. 'Let us hold on firmly to the hope we profess, because we can trust God to keep His promise.' (Hebrews 10:23 GNT)</p>

Ephesians 3:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>The story goes that the king of Saudi Arabia met up with a famous golfer. Before the man returned home the king said, 'I'd like to give you a gift. Anything you want; name it.' Politely, the golfer said he didn't need anything. But because the king insisted, he gave in: 'Well, Your Highness, I collect golf clubs.' He imagined unwrapping a gold putter or a diamond-studded driver. Imagine his shock weeks later when he got a letter containing the deed to an 800-hectare golf club! </p>
<p>Paul says, 'God...is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare ask or hope...' Kings don't think like we do. They don't bust a blood vessel over what's in the treasure chest, because the treasure chest has more than you could ever imagine. Of course, you know Jesus' nickname, don't you? That would be 'King of Kings'-which means He has the treasure chests of all treasure chests. And because He's your friend, He wants to share the loot.</p>
<p>God's plan for you far outweighs owning your own personal golf course. So go on, what kind of good things can you imagine? (We're not talking here about winning the lottery or X Factor or anything that could drive a huge wedge between you and God.) Now double them, quadruple them, and you're still not close to what God has for you-if you'll believe. Expect the best and you'll get the best, and more.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let ...patience...do a thorough work...' James 1:4 AMP<br /><br /><p>There's a joke about a man on death row. The prison warden asks him what he'd like for his last meal. He says, 'A huge piece of watermelon.' The warden goes, 'You must be joking! Watermelons aren't in season till summer and it's only just winter.' The inmate replies, 'That's okay, I don't mind waiting.' I bet he doesn't!</p>
<p>But here's the question: do <i>you</i> mind waiting? How do you act when things don't move fast enough? Are you a pin up saint of patience or do you seethe with annoyance?</p>
<p>A well-known minister writes, 'I happened to be in a store and had waited a long time in a slow-moving line to pay for one little item. The people in front of me had stacks of items. Then I was overlooked while somebody else was served ahead of me. When it was finally my turn, the sales assistant looked at me and said, Thank you for waiting. Are you who I think you are-that preacher on TV? I knew the minute you walked in that it was you. I thought to myself, What if I'd been angry and mouthing off because I wasn't served in the proper order?' See, you never know who is watching. When you're shooting your mouth off, you're not being a good rep for Jesus. So watch your mouth because you never know who else is watching it too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...encourage the fainthearted, help the weak...' 1 Thessalonians 5:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>OK, so your heart works overtime when somebody asks you what you did on the weekend and you mumble: 'Erm...actually...I...er...went to church.' Nobody wants to get the third degree just because they think what Jesus said makes sense. Nor do you want to get singled out just because you don't believe life is the end-result of some random explosion billions of years ago.</p>
<p>But imagine if you walked out your door this morning and got whisked off to jail just for wearing a WWJD wristband. Right now millions of Christians around the world face prison and sometimes death simply because they believe the same stuff as you. Pretty tough, huh?</p>
<p>Your God says, 'Encourage the fainthearted, help the weak.' It only takes one thing to be an encourager: a willingness to 'bear the weaknesses of those without strength.' (Romans 15:1 NAS) Check out <i>www.myheartbleeds.com.au</i> for inspiring ways to encourage those who are persecuted for what they believe. And before you say, 'What have somebody else's problems got to do with me?' then read this: 'If one member suffers, all the members suffer.' (1 Corinthians 12:26 NKJ) You wouldn't stay quiet if your sister was being bashed, would you? Guess what, that <i>is</i> your sister (and your brother) that is getting bashed around the world-your sister and brother in Christ. For their sake, don't stay silent.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...loves to see His servants do well.' Psalm 35:27 NCV<br /><br /><p>Ah, remember Sports Day? Embarrassing parents shouting at the top of their tonsils at their 'little cherub' who is obviously the fastest, bestest, most talented kid ever to balance an egg on a spoon. A bit 'biased', perhaps?</p>
<p>Know what? God is a bit 'biased' about you. Jesus said, 'If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in Heaven give good things...' (Matthew 7:11 NKJ) In other words, if you think you want good stuff for your kids, you can't even imagine what good stuff God wants for them.</p>
<p>Do you have this wild-eyed idea about how to bring a bit of God's Kingdom to your mates? So wild that, quite frankly, your pastor nearly choked when you told him? So out-there that your best mates booked a van to take you to the place with soft walls and rubber cutlery? So crazy, your own brain feels sore whenever you try to think about it?</p>
<p>If you keep coming back to this big idea and every time you do, those little hairs on the back of your neck do star-jumps, perhaps it's a prompting from the Holy Spirit in you. Why not step out and see if God comes through and surprises everyone?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...loves to see His servants do well.' Psalm 35:27 NCV<br /><br /><p>Whoaaa! Stop that horse! Yesterday we galloped straight ahead into the sunset because God was giving us the green light. Adrenalin and excitement are great for getting us out of the starting blocks but what if we're about to join a long distance race rather than a fast sprint? Perhaps, our wild-eyed idea needs some thinking if it's going to go the distance.</p>
<p>First, let's think about what our idea will cost us. Sure, we'll gain a whole load of God's Kingdom, but, realistically, we'll lose something of ourselves. What are you going to give up? Some of your 'you time', a bit of your 'head space', a slice of your pride? Maybe, you'll need to give up 'sole ownership' or 'copyright' on your idea- it's amazing how much further your dream will go when you're not bothered about who gets the credit.</p>
<p>Secondly, fill in the detail. Get precise with the do's and don'ts; set yourself deadlines, goals, targets; make the most of your gifts, talents, time and energy. Get others to help you flesh out the dream; write lists for what needs to be done, run with your idea.</p>
<p>Thirdly, see it! Imagine the idea on its feet; see yourself running with it, working it, doing it. Romans 4:17 NKJ says that God 'calls those things which do not exist as though they did.' Now, are you ready? The lights are turning green...</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not do your charitable deeds...to be seen.' Matthew 6:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>What would you think if your mate had a chicken and you were partial to scrambled eggs? You'd hope he'd share the wealth and pass a few free eggs your way, right? If he forced you to cough up every time you got a bit peckish-you'd think he was Scrooge Junior, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>A world famous preacher called Charles Spurgeon did just that. No way did old Charles give away free eggs. Friends and family alike were told to splash the cash. The old fella must've been a right tight wad, don't you think? Everybody else did. Until the full story finally came out.</p>
<p>What he didn't tell anyone was that all the profits from his sales were given to two old widows. If only Charles would've just said so, he could've avoided all the goss that he was 'greedy'. But you see Charles Spurgeon took Jesus' words literally: 'But when you help a needy person, do it in such a way that even your closest friend will not know about it. Then it will be a private matter. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.' (Matthew 6:3-4 GNT)</p>
<p>Do you fan yourself down with your crisp note, bite it and then cough loudly as you place it in the church collection? Do you smile for the CCTV camera when you're about to help an old lady across the road? What's today's verse again...?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God chose us to be His own people in union with Christ...' Ephesians 1:11 GNT<br /><br /><p>For squillions of years, people with clever-sounding names have wrinkled the muscles of their foreheads struggling to come up with an answer to all this 'life' business. And here's little old you, barely a high school certificate to your name, with the problem sussed!</p>
<p>Without God, life has no meaning. It's all about Him. 'He created all things in Heaven and on earth, visible and invisible. Whether they are kings or lords, rulers or powers-everything has been created through Him and for Him.' (Colossians 1:16 GWT) If we're going to grow in God, we need to stop thinking about ourselves all the time. What should<i> I</i> do with my life? What are <i>my</i> dreams? What does the future have for <i>me</i>? 'If you try to keep your life for yourself, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for me, you will find true life.' (Matthew 16:25 NLT)</p>
<p>Even before you were a thought in your mum's head, God dreamed up amazing stuff for you to do. He has custom-built assignments only you can undertake. The trouble is you can waste time trying to fit into the world's mould rather stretch out in God's freedom. Some people make life about accumulating things-good job, piles of money, nice house, fancy car, latest fashion. Others make it about show business; they want the world to pick them up in a planet-sized spotlight. But life only comes into sharp focus when you connect yourself to God's purpose. Without God, life is meaningless.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't just pretend that you love others... Stand on the side of the good.' Romans 12:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>What makes a normally sane and sensible mum suddenly scream like a wild-eyed, giggling teenager at an Andr Rieu concert? What makes a usually quiet, grumpy dad high-five a complete stranger at the sight of Steve Waugh's double-century comeback? What possesses you to plaster posters all over your bedroom wall?</p>
<p>The answer is adoration. It's as if something in us wants to throw our hearts at something out of our reach. Could it be that we're built with a default setting to worship and adore someone greater than ourselves? Whether we choose to worship <i>God</i> or not, our heart will always find something to love (even if it's ourselves).</p>
<p>Growing in God means loving God. Jesus said it is the most important thing we can do: 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment.' (Matthew 22: 37-38 ESV)</p>
<p>When you fall big-time for Mr or Miss Heart-throb, you can't stop thinking of them, right? You've got one topic of conversation, right? You try to hang out where they hang out, right? This is what our worship of God should look like. We sing songs because we're mad about God. We talk about God a lot because we're one-track-minded. We want to do certain things just to get a glimpse of God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord shares His plans with those who have respect for Him...' Psalm 25:14 NIV<br /><br />
<p>You wouldn't have much of a mate if you only saw them once a week and if they had one eye on the clock the whole time because they had somewhere better to go afterwards. Likewise, you won't grow a close friendship with God just by attending church once a week.</p>
<p>Best mates phone each other up, constantly comment on Facebook updates, chill in each other's rooms, hang out, share secrets, laugh together, cry on each other's shoulders. Friendships grow close through the ups and downs of each and every day.</p>
<p>Jesus didn't die just so you could have a moral code to live by. Jesus died so that you can call God your friend: '...now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God-all because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us in making us friends of God.' (Romans 5:11 NLT)</p>
<p>Don't miss out on the closeness of God-your relationship can be so much more than an appointment in your diary. Every conversation, every problem, every thought, can involve God, if you choose. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 calls it, 'praying without ceasing' and it means an open-ended conversation whilst you shop, in school, at work, in the shower or on your bike! It's not about making time <em>for</em> God; it's about being <em>with</em> Him. Share every waking, living moment with God and become best friends with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This life that I live now, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave His life for me.' Galatians 2:20 GNT<br /><br />
<p>It's tempting to think it's all glamour and fun when you see someone accept their award for Best Leading Actor at the Oscars. What you haven't seen, though, is the blood, sweat and tears that have gone before. Nobody drags themselves onto a film set and puts in a winning performance without a lot of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>The best actors submerge themselves in the lives of the character they're playing. They ask themselves: what makes this character tick? What's their back-story? What drives them on? So-called 'method actors' even begin to live like their character in order to portray them as accurately as possible.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is a bit like being a 'method actor'. We try to live like Jesus in order to portray Him accurately. We submerge ourselves into the role of Christ. If we're serious about becoming Christ-like we start acting like Him. We ask what makes Jesus tick; we study His actions in the Bible; we develop His habits. Philippians 2:5 NIV says, 'Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.'</p>
<p>What does this mean? If we start practicing being kind, we get good at being kind. If we rehearse being loving, loving becomes our second nature. If we act thoughtfully, we develop into a thoughtful person. We don't play-act being Christ to become a fake, shallow Christian who's only interested in looking good; we genuinely want to imitate Christ to become like Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...' Psalm 23:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>David wasn't some singer-songwriter wannabe on the sniff of a number one when he wrote Psalm 23; he knew what opposition looked like. This is the guy who spent years in the wilderness dodging King Saul's sword, living off his wits to stay alive. So how can a man pushed to the edge write such upbeat lyrics? 'You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life...' (vv 5-6 NKJ) </p>
<p>That word 'surely'. Underline it. It's God's guarantee. If a man who didn't even know if he'd live to see the next day can write 'surely' goodness will follow me wherever I go, shouldn't we be able to grab ourselves a big bag of God's 'surely' too? And what about that bit where David's enemies get ringside seats at his bless-fest? He's saying God chooses to bless you in face of any tough opposition. He's saying that God will strengthen you when you most need it. Years later, Paul agreed: 'Because when I am weak, then I am truly strong.' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NCV)</p>
<p>Whether your enemy is a person or a situation, Psalm 23 gives us the confidence to know that as long as we don't take matters into our own hands, good stuff is 'surely' about to be served up.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...As...Peter was standing by the fire...' John 18:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>What's with Simon Peter? One minute he's swearing he'll go to the death with Jesus; the next he's swearing he doesn't even <i>know</i> Jesus. Just hours after waving his sword about trying to defend Jesus, Simon Peter is asked, 'You are not one of His disciples, are you?' He denies it, saying, 'I am not.' (John 18:18, 25 NIV)</p>
<p>Do you have your own wavering moments? One moment you're promising to win all your friends for Christ but a few weeks on, you're keeping your 'Christian life' well and truly hidden? See, under pressure we can trip ourselves up. But how do we find our feet again? Simple: we come back to Jesus armed with our apologies. You can pretend your mistake is no big deal or you can point the finger at others, but you can't pull the wool over God's eyes. Hebrews 4:13 NLT says, 'Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before His eyes, and He is the one to whom we are accountable.' God already knows your trip-up; He's waiting for you to admit you've done wrong and ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Simon Peter denied Jesus to a huddle of men gathered by a fire. Days later, around another fire, Peter acknowledged Jesus as Lord. Peter put right his wrong. Jesus forgave and restored. Put your wrong right.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us examine our ways and test them...' Lamentations 3:40 NIV<br /><br /><p>Whether you've got a brain-box like Einstein or a mind like a muddle-headed wombat, the book of Proverbs is for you! '...even smart people can find good advice in these words.' (Proverbs 1:5 NCV) Try this one: 'Stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a complaining fool is worse than either.' (Proverbs 27:3 NCV) There's nothing like a gripe to bring everybody down, is there? When you're complaining, you can be sure your heart (and that of everyone else around you) will feel as heavy as stone.</p>
<p>That's why Philippians 2:14 NCV tells us to: 'Do everything without complaining or arguing.' Going on a 'whinge binge' won't change a situation; only taking positive action will. Fact is, if you screw up your face in a grumbling mess, you're not going to remove the situation from your life. Tackling it head on is the only way to see change.</p>
<p>So, how can we mute the volume of the moan? Be honest with yourself-is there something you're doing wrong? Instead of pointing the finger at the whole world,  take a look in the mirror. What needs to change? Is that mixture of sarcasm and sulk bringing about results? So what will change things, and what stuff is best left in God's hands?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' Proverbs 10:32 NLT</p>
<p>'Careless talk cost lives' was a famous poster campaign in Britain during the Second World War. See, if G.I. Joe was impressing the girls at the bar saying, 'I fly to Berlin tomorrow to wipe off the moustache from under Hitler's nose,' guess who was going to be shot down once the German spy got on the blower?</p>
<p><br />Perhaps we'd benefit from wearing that slogan next to our WWJD wristbands. Getting stuck into somebody with slanderous words makes us look unattractive. Who knows who could be listening to our cruel words, thinking, 'Well, if that's what Christians do, you can forget it.' Our careless words could dishonour Christ.</p>
<p><br />So how do you keep your God-gloss from going all goss-gloss on you? (1) Facts not fiction. Let's not even begin to snowball the story when it could all be pure fiction. (2) Mind your own business. Even if it is true, does it directly affect you? Should you be talking about it? Chances are if it's sensitive, then it should be private. You're not doing anybody any favours, especially God, if you're broadcasting secrets all over the airwaves. (3) Helpful or hurtful? Do you help the situation by plastering it on Facebook or does that end up hurting people? Help or hurt-the choice is yours.</p>
