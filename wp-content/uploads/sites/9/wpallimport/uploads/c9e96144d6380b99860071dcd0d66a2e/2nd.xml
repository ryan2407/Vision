<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Shame has got a few classic by-lines. Like: 'You're a pathetic excuse for a Christian,' 'Seriously, are you still trying to kick that filthy habit?' In some ways, shame can be really good at getting us moving - but often in the wrong direction: 'Hey, I'm so awful, I'd better keep my head down.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is, when we take in the message of shame, our lives get smaller as we shrink into ourselves. We mark off our world and create a space for ourselves far smaller than the one God has planned. If you've ever been embarrassed or shamed by others in church - then, know this: love is the main way to grow healthily. God's way is release. Conviction (His wake-up call to sin) leads that way. Condemnation (wallowing in fear, guilt, embarrassment or humiliation) doesn't. It loops you back into yourself. God only calls you out on sin so you won't have it get in your way. God is the one who'll fix you up, so come closer to Him in love. Shame isn't His tool to force you to bow down to Him. If you feel yourself being convicted of sin, deal with it, be turned from it and walk in the right direction.</p>
<p>And if you are a person who shames, rather than is ashamed, remember what Jesus said to the disciples who wanted to incinerate a village for not showing the right respect. He said, 'You do not know what manner of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them...' (Luke 9:54-56 NKJ)</p>
<p>Remember too: 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself.' (Matthew 19:19 NKJ)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman...' 2 Kings 4:8 NKJ</p>
<p>Today, meet a woman who redefined the meaning of the idea of going 'beyond the call of duty'. She knew Elisha was doing God's work and all she wanted was to serve him - starting with feeding him. Then she took it further. She organised a room to be built for him from scratch, complete with home comforts. She met all these needs, despite having some pretty massive needs of her own. We learn through the story she was absolutely desperate for a child but, for whatever reason, she was missing out. That hole in her life didn't stop her serving and filling someone else's needs - she simply got on with loving God and reaching out to others. You might think that she had every reason to be bitter. But this woman refused to live a life of sour lemons.</p>
<p>Elisha, grateful for her serving heart and the room she made specially for him, wanted to give back to her. And he wanted to fill her heart with joy. So God enabled him to prophesy the arrival of a baby.</p>
<p>Jesus says, 'Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.' (Matthew 6:33 NLT) Even though she actually lived hundreds of years before these words were spoken, the woman of Shunem instinctively knew this was true and gave us a powerful example to follow. So, if there's something you're doing that has a bitter edge to it, ask God for the grace to do it gladly.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>We all have our battlegrounds; in some cases we surrendered to things years ago that now lurk in our innermost thoughts. That's why the Scriptures warn, 'Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.' (Proverbs 4:23 NKJ) Max Lucado writes: 'I'm...far from home. The voices that encourage are distant; the voices that entice are near. A placard... on top of the TV promises late-night movies that will &quot;make all my fantasies come true&quot;. In the phone book several columns of escort services offer &quot;Love away from home&quot;. Voices! Some for pleasure, some for power. The world hammers at your door; Jesus taps. The world promises fleshly pleasure; Jesus promises us a quiet dinner...with Him: &quot;...I will come in and eat with him, and he with Me.&quot; (Revelation 3:20 NIV)'</p>
<p>Which voice will you obey? So, how should you handle tempting situations? In two ways: First, <em>by filling your mind with Scripture</em> so that your first response is always, 'It is written.' Second, <em>by keeping your eyes on Jesus</em>. Lesley Durkin writes, 'My father used to put a bit of meat on the floor near his dog and say, &quot;No!&quot; The dog never touched it. But he never looked at it either, because if he did the temptation to disobey would have been too great. He just kept looking at my father's face.' Keep your eyes on Jesus. '...God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Problems and trials...are good for us...' Romans 5:3 TLB<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>Let's face it, work was never designed to be easy. It was designed to get necessary things done. Sometimes we're fortunate enough to do work that we love, but often it's a drag-our-heels job. Colossians 3:23 tells us to put our whole heart into everything, really devote ourselves to it, just like we were doing our work for God. It's difficult. When we put our whole heart into all our work, with the idea that our boss, teacher, coach or manager is Jesus (which should make us work better...), we stand out as a great Christian and we also grow character. Our greatest progress comes from our greatest pain; hence God doesn't save us from problems, but strengthens us in them.</p>
<p>Pull your weight beyond what is asked of you; offer new perspectives and ideas; be positive even when times seem totally tough; be an encourager of those you work with; nail those obstacles. If you act like that then you will undoubtedly please your boss, teacher, coach or manager. The more the people over you who are not Christian see you acting with integrity, the more your walk of faith will attract them. We also need to learn to endure. James writes, '...See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm...' (James 5:7-8 NIV) You can't shorten the seasons or hurry the harvest, so be patient. While you're waiting, God is on the job too. As we work, God is at work in us, making sure that, if we do not give up, the trials and problems will work out for His glory.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'What does the Lord require of you ?...to love kindness...' Micah 6:8 NAS<br /><br /></p>
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
<p>'Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.' (That's Martin Luther King Jr.) When we're actively looking for ways to show love to others, not just holding it as an 'idea' in our heads, it can shift atmosphere, perspective and feelings all for the better. Often it starts with a practical act of the love that we bear.</p>
<p>When King David showed kindness to a man called Mephibosheth who was disabled in both legs (2 Samuel 9), he let him sit at his table and eat with him. Today it's rightly considered to be wrong to discriminate against anyone who's physically impaired. Back then, it was the opposite. But when David let Mephibosheth sit at his table he was making a point - with his legs hidden under the King's table, he appeared just as David actually knew he was: equal.</p>
<p>There are countless people like Mephibosheth who think they don't deserve to be shown any respect or kindness - people who perhaps only know crumbs of love at best, swept off the table and underfoot. Yet by showing them the love of Jesus, we can break the pattern of who they think they are. They can become free to know who they are in Christ, deeply moulded to His image.</p>
<p><em>Every day we miss opportunities to be kind in order to save a few seconds</em>. But what if next time you feel a surge of compassion towards someone, you consider that as a prompt from God to perform a random act of kindness. It wouldn't just change the other person's life, it will change yours too.</p>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan spoke at a national prayer breakfast: ‘We poison our society when we remove its theological underpinnings. We court corruption when we leave it bereft of belief... Those who believe must be free to speak of and act on their belief, to apply moral teaching to public questions… without God, there is no virtue, because there’s no prompting of the conscience. Without God, we’re mired in the material, that flat world that tells us only what the senses perceive... And without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure.’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Praying for our nation, leaders and communities matters big time (see 1 Timothy 2:1–4). When Abraham prayed on behalf of the doomed city Sodom and Gomorrah, God agreed to let them off if only fifty righteous people could be found. Sadly, Abraham couldn’t even find ten.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But there’s hope in this story—a righteous minority can be used by God (even used to allow Him to move in their city), bring revival to the church, and change the course of our nation. ‘If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.’</span></p>

<p>And yet, Psalm 107:2 says, ‘Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story…’ Why? Because your story is incredibly valuable (and even mentioning that you go to church or believe in God can be sufficient at times to get people intrigued enough to start with). People can argue over the historical evidence for Jesus, or struggle to take the Bible at face value. But it’s more of a stretch to deny what God has done for you personally. For some of your mates, you are the best proof of God’s existence and power. And if you struggle to express this, you certainly aren’t alone. If it is hard for you to tell your story of how Jesus has changed your life, ask God for His help and His courage. Maybe ‘practise’ initially by telling people you trust or speaking to someone you know who is already searching for God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 10-14, Matt 19:1-12, Ps 136:1-12, Pro 6:30-31<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58973&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your wages disappear... in pockets filled with holes!' Haggai 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Haggai, a prophet in the Old Testament, lived at a time when the Israelites had become so obsessed with getting rich, they’d forgotten about God. Haggai prophetically chastised them about how they’d spent everything investing in their own ‘panelled houses’ while God’s house lay in ruins.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>He was right, of course: if we belong to Him, and all we have has come from and belongs to Him, then what right have we to decide how our money is used? After all, if someone came along and randomly stuck $100 in your hand, the first thing you would ask is: ‘What’s this for’?</span></p>
<p>But how about this for an even more radical principle: each time you receive any money, be it wages or anything else, ask <em>God</em>: ‘What’s this for?’ and figure out what He might want. Life will certainly get a whole lot more interesting! A lot of Christians stick to a principle called the ‘tithe’—in other words, setting aside the first 10 per cent of everything you earn and giving it to God. That puts Him first, it shows that we’re not forgetting Him and that His plans for healing this broken world are important to us too. Try out the ‘what’s this for?’ principle. Next time you receive ‘unassigned’ money (e.g. you’ve not been told by your mum ‘this is for new shoes’), don’t do anything with it until you’ve asked God precisely what it’s for. (Oh, and remember, this is still the God who wants YOU to be looked after, too!)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 15-18, Matt 19:13-19, Ps 136:13-26, Pro 6:32-35<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58975&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the jar of flour will not be used up...' 1 Kings 17:14 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Three thousand years ago, give or take a hundred. Devastating famine has swept the land. Wiped out a widow’s livestock. Destroyed all she relied on. And then Elijah, a major prophet, turns up—God has sent him her way. <em>I can’t put him up for the night unless I split this one portion of food I have left. Alright God, thank You for this opportunity. I really doubt what I have is anywhere near enough. But I want to trust You with my life—so I’m going to use the little I have to feed him too. Amen...? </em></span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Most of us have times that we feel what we have is simply not enough. Often, however much we cut back, our cash outgoings always slightly exceed our income. In these moments, after that bill has finally been paid, the thought of giving away what little we have left seems simply insane. And if you haven’t reached that stage where you’re paying bills, firstly, enjoy this stage while it lasts! Also, remember this reading; it might turn out pretty important later on. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>In the meantime, with what money you are given, we reckon the same lessons apply. God hasn’t changed in the last three thousand years: when we give away the little we have, the door is left wide open for a miracle. For the woman at the beginning of the reading, she faced her fear and fed Elijah, and the flour inexplicably just kept on coming. We’re called by God to manage what we’ve got to the best of our ability and that means trusting God with it <em>all</em>, rather than clinging on anxiously to the bit that’s left.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><strong><em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span></span></em></strong><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You can also ‘tithe’ your time if not your cash. Think of ways to help out others in your community or church—sometimes the most important thing you can give others is your time. </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 20:17, 2 Kings 5:1-27, Ecc 5:10, Luke 12:13-34 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59016&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the disciples picked up twelve baskets.' Mark 6:43 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Most of us know the story of the little boy with five rolls, a couple of fish and 5,000 hungry men (to say nothing of the women and children). Jesus multiplied that simple meal and fed the whole crowd. It’s been said the reason there were twelve baskets of bread left over was because everyone actually whipped out their own packed lunches and tucked in. Some people, in other words, think of it as a lesson in sharing rather than an example of generous giving topped up with superpower faith. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But, let’s set aside this secular worldview! Instead in our faith in Christ as Lord, we see a God who both gives us a reason to be generous and then, out of His goodness and great power, multiplies a thousand–fold what little we are able to give. Jesus, after all, only does what He sees God doing. ‘So Jesus answered them, “I tell you the truth: the Son can do nothing on His own; He does only what He sees His Father doing. What the Father does, the Son also does.”’ (John 5:19 GNT) The truth is, God provides bread for us by multiplying grain each year in fields across the world. One seed in the earth results in a head of grain with hundreds of seeds. It’s the same sort of miracle as Jesus performed with the loaves.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>It comes down to this: God owns it all anyway. If we give back to Him, like a farmer planting seed, He’ll watch over the harvest for us. It’s about your heart, about sacrificial giving and about saying, ‘Here’s all I have Lord,’ and watching Him multiply that gift, however small.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 19-22, Matt 19:20-30, Ps 106:1-23, Pro 7:1-2<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59030&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain...' Genesis 41:56 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>During Joseph’s time as second–in–charge of the land of Egypt, the people were starving. Crops hadn’t grown, so trading stopped and a once–wealthy nation was brought to its knees. Sound familiar? Much of the western world is in a time of crisis right now. Recession, unemployment and prices are rising and benefit payments are failing to keep up. Sadly, you don’t have to look far to find good people struggling to feed their families for reasons beyond their control.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>As a young man Joseph was downright foolish at times, but he loved God and worked hard. His life was a rollercoaster of ups and downs. Through it all he remained faithful to God, learned his lessons and used his gifts. Ultimately God blessed him and the whole of Egypt as well as his own family through him. God gave him wisdom to see the problems coming and a plan to save the country.</span></p>
<p>God wants to use you too. Greed has brought the world to its knees and we need an antidote. God is calling young people like us to model a new way of living, a new way of working, a new way of doing business and a new way of taking care of the lost, the last and the least. If you’re coming out of a family or community hit hard by hopelessness, don’t lose sight of God. He hasn’t lost sight of you, and hasn’t abandoned His hope for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 1:1-4:17, Matt 20:1-16, Ps 106:24-48, Pro 7:3-5<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59022&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors.' 1 Kings 21:3 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Integrity.</span></em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;> As Christians, we shouldn’t ‘sell out’ to something that compromises what God really wants for us. Read on, this is important. A few of the Christian guidelines that the world bins as ‘boring’ are the ones God has given us to lead to true freedom and life. For example, He taught us to prioritise other people, to check our anger, envy and gossip, and to recognise the spiritual and psychological damage that sex outside of a marital relationship can do to us. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So, standing your ground when other influences hit is going to be essential. In 1 Kings 21:3 NIV, Naboth had inherited land that happened to be right next to the King’s palace. The King wasn’t too happy about it, and even offered Naboth good money. Yet Naboth had integrity; he stood by what was appointed for him. He said, ‘The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!’ Well done! Unfortunately, this decision did cost him heavily (read the whole story in 1 Kings 21:1–11).</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Yes, it’s an extreme example, but Christian principles are always being attacked, in different ways in every generation, from the smallest compromise to the biggest. Will you stand up? It can seem ‘bigger and better’ to give in (‘<em>that out–of–date, restrictive religion of yours doesn’t work in our modern world…’</em>). We know it’s hard, but God wants to hear you being honest. He will help you live right, and to stand up for what is right in the world. Is there an area of your life where compromise is rearing its ugly head? Pray and ask God for His help and His wisdom. Take a stand in your heart and make the right decision—you won’t regret it.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 4:18-6:33, Matt 20:17-23, Ps 112, Pro 7:6-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59024&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Pretty extreme, but there are people like that out there. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>At the other end of the spectrum is the stereotype of the workshy sponging–off–parents people, half asleep on the sofa. Calling in ‘sick’ to classes or not very interested in finding a job. This might not be <em>your </em>style, but we have to be wary—laziness is something that will catch you out if you let it (check out Proverbs 13:4). Are we condemning you? No, we just want you to make the most of the time on your hands.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>In Acts 18 we read about Paul. Even as he travelled around, in between preaching and teaching, he made tents to provide for himself, not always relying on people to provide for him. Tents? It was a profitable trade at that time. He worked with dedication and persistence in something that wasn’t the important, central part of his life’s mission, in order to allow it to go on. So wherever life is taking you, work hard as if you were doing it for the Lord Himself. Make a list of all the things you spend time doing in a week and estimate the hours of time spent on each. Is your balance right, or does something need to change?</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 7-9, Matt 20:24-34, Ps 27, Pro 7:10-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59026&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let God transform... by changing the way you think.' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Are there things in your life that are winding you up at the moment? A situation, a person, your church? The Bible is pretty clear on the way change comes about—no matter what the problem is, it begins with us. By ‘the renewing of your mind’ (Romans 12:2 NIV), we automatically become more understanding, more patient and far wiser about how to deal with it. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Here are a few ways that you might help to continually change your attitude:</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(a) <em>Apologise</em>. You know that person you think you may have upset? You probably did. Don’t wait around, be honest about whatever mistake(s) you’ve made. (b) <em>View setbacks as detours</em>, not dead ends and see what there is to learn for next time. (c) <em>Think about who you’re listening to</em>; keep the positive godly influences and tune out the negative. (d) <em>Choose not to complain</em>; work on figuring out more productive solutions and approaches. Above all, (e) <em>Self–control—</em>have some! Frustration easily leads to saying things that aren’t helpful, tweeting or Facebooking things you shouldn’t, slating people in authority and making on–the–spot–not–thought–out decisions. If you’re angry, take a walk, deep breaths, calm yourself down. Don’t act until you’re calm!<strong><em> </em></strong>Apologising is your first stop here. Ask God to remind you of those outstanding apologies you need to make. Swallow that pride and make them before you forget!</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 10-12, Matt 21:1-11, Ps 135, Pro 7:21-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59028&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let there be no strife between you and me...' Genesis 13:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>'So Abram, his wife, and Lot left Egypt, taking everything they owned, and traveled to southern Canaan. Abram was very rich in cattle, silver, and gold... Lot also had flocks, herds, and tents. Abram and Lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together, so Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen began to argue.’ (Genesis 13:1–7 NLT)</p>
<p>Abram was wise and suggested they part ways, and he gave Lot first choice. Lot picked the very fertile area around the town of Sodom as his choice of farmland. Abram chose to build an altar to God as his first action. Same genes; different values. Lot saw it as a get–rich–quick scheme. But what ‘Sodom’ really offered was about as far from Godly principles as was possible. Abram revealed his true colours by building himself a reminder of who God is. In effect, he says ‘my life’s wealth and security is dependent on God and nothing else’.</p>
<p>It’s hard when your values clash with your family’s. If you feel pressured into<em> have</em>–to win–arguments–at–<em>all</em>–cost, then take a lesson from Abram and turn to God first. He has you and your family’s best interests at heart. In keeping eyes on Him and not winning petty faith debates, you’re letting Him steer your witness. Exodus 20:12 says, ‘Honour your father and mother.’ What if your family values differ from Biblical ones? Ponder on how it is possible to respect your parents and (if it’s a potential problem) not to betray your faith.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59041&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let there be no strife between you and me... for we are brothers.' Genesis 13:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>So in Genesis 13, we have a story that shows one family with two outlooks. Abram, driven by faith, is a giver; Lot, driven by security, is a taker. Out of respect, Lot should have looked after his aging uncle’s welfare rather than putting his own first. Unfortunately he looked out for ‘number one’ instead.</p>
<p>Abram could have assumed top–dog status and ensured that this scrap of a nephew knew his rightful place. He didn’t; he showed grace. Read on further in the Bible passage and you’ll see that Lot’s denial of Abram lands him right in the middle of 24/7 party island, where anything goes—including sexual depravity, idol worship and violence. In the space of just six chapters, everything Lot took was destroyed. <em>Good deal?</em> Abram, on the other hand, (who has through all this stuck stubbornly to his child–like faith in God) becomes a ‘father to nations’. As God promises him, ‘Look… northward and southward and eastward and westward… all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.’ (Genesis 13:14–15 NAS) <em>Christian Life 101</em>: it pays to stick to your Godly values. Ask yourself the tough question: Which do you value most—security or faith? If you’re brave enough, ask God to take away your comfort in order to lean more on Him. If you’re not brave enough, ask God to bring you into deeper faith with Him so you can lean more on Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:22, 1 Cor 13, Eph 3:14-21, John 15:1-17 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59042&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... I have set before you life and death... choose life...' Deuteronomy 30:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever noticed this: in just about every film you will see, the action only really starts happening once the main character has some epiphany or sudden personal revelation? Doesn’t matter if it’s Tony Stark, James T Kirk, Clark Kent or Mia Thermopolis in <em>The Princess Diaries—</em>it’s only when the character in question gets to the end of their tether, seriously mucks things up or finds themselves alone that they actively choose to get things together and sort their lives out so that things actually change. Characters are defined by their choices. So are you.</p>
<p>So what choices have you made? Do you find yourself all–too–often choosing the easy option? Or do you decide to decide later?... The life you have been given is too precious to spend just assuming things will turn out all right if you just coast along. It doesn’t matter if you never match Clark Kent’s latest heroic adventure, what does matter is that the choices you make bring you closer to God and help you rather than hinder you in your journey with Him. Choosing to spend a few minutes with God and to say <em>yes</em> to Him when you come up against decisions can have a far more positively profound impact than you may realise! Choosing to say <em>yes</em> to following Jesus can often seem like the hardest thing on the planet, but the rewards are out of this world. Consider the choices you made yesterday—did they bring you closer to God, or did they just leave you sitting still or, worse, did they push you away from Jesus? Do you need to make a change today?</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59043&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You must build... according to the pattern I will show you.'  Exodus 25:9 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>If you want to build tall, you need to go deep. The most important part of any building is what you don’t see, the foundations under the surface. That’s why whatever you’re trying to build—a relationship, a family, a church/ministry, or your own walk with God—strong foundation is vital.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>When he was the leader of God’s people, Moses spent over a month waiting in God’s presence for direction: ‘Then Moses disappeared into the cloud as he climbed higher up the mountain. He remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights.’ (Exodus 24:17–18 NLT) Why? Because he knew that what he was building had to meet the needs of God’s people for generations. God told Moses to go to Him for the plan, and he obeyed. This was more than just checking in with God and then toddling off to get on with his plan—God was the centre stone, the beginning and end, the Source of it all.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>It’s the same for us. His promise is, ‘If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God…and it will be given to him.’ (James 1:5 NIV) Want to build a solid, strong life? God knows what’s up ahead for you, and He knows how to guide you. Focus on one thing you want to build in your life—an amazing marriage, maybe, or your dream career. Maybe it’s as fundamental as you being a strong man/woman of God. Ask Him: am I laying the right foundations at the moment? If not, what do I need to change?</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 18:17-20:21, Matt 21:33-46, Ps 115, Pro 8:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59044&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

He was a wealthy Englishman who, following a successful career as a cricketer, sold everything he had to take the Gospel to the nations. Though his family did all they could to persuade him not to go, he went anyway—first to China, then India, then Africa, putting his life at risk countless times for the sake of the Good News of Jesus. He died on the mission field, aged 70.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Just before he died, Studd wrote the following powerful words: ‘The time for waiting is past! … Should such men as we fear? Before the whole world… before the sleepy, lukewarm, faithless, namby–pamby Christian world, we will dare to trust our God… We will a thousand times sooner die trusting only in our God than live trusting in man.’</span></p>

<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Classic songs, ad campaigns—what is it about ‘coming together’ that strikes such a chord with us? Why is it that when a bunch of people get together to work on something good, or just to share a happy experience, that things seem right?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Maybe there’s something in Jesus’ idea that ‘I and the Father are one’ and that ‘all of them [<em>that’s us, by the way</em>] may be one’. That strange sense of something special that comes at a gig, or a party (or, surprise surprise, a church service...) is a reflection of this core truth about reality—unity tells us something special about God. For Christians, it’s more than just recognising that we share similarities. We actually share in Jesus’ being, just as Jesus shares in His Father’s; all one.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So, agreement in the Church is a precious thing, worth protecting. There’s a great example of a serious argument in the early Church in Acts 15 (about circumcision, too—a fairly delicate subject...) The believers stuck through the argument, even when it got to the teeth–baring, claws–out stage, because they knew the main thing was that they were already in this together. That deep connection of brother–and–sisterhood–in–Christ was what they were working from and aiming for—it’s why the word ‘brother’ gets thrown around so much in the New Testament. The result of their stubborn striving for unity? ‘There was great joy throughout the church that day.’ (Acts 15:31 NLT)</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 24-25, Matt 22:15-22, Ps 19, Pro 8:6-7<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59046&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God' Romans 10:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>What’s the worst life–scenario you can imagine..? Give this a try: you’re born into poverty in the mid–1800s, in an area of Britain where poverty is rife. Not a great start. On top of that, you can’t read. <em>And </em>you’ve been picking turnips just to get by since an early age. Sad story... But a true one. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But Smith Wigglesworth is said to have seen 23 people raised from the dead when he came to Australia! A woman is said to have held her own cancer in her hand after a faith–healing encounter with him. Sight was given to the sightless, the voiceless found speech and the deaf could hear again. Crazy. Who would have guessed that, despite his background, he’d turn out to be a hugely influential part of God’s Kingdom? <em>(Pssst: actually anyone can be used by God.)</em> </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So what was Smith Wigglesworth’s secret? This legend of a guy (look him up!) had faith that came from reading one hardback only: the Bible. Smith learned to break through the illiteracy of his youth by reading it. He coined the motto—‘Fear looks; faith jumps.’ He had the cheek to take God <em>directly</em> by His Word—you know, living out the promises about joy, healing, and fulfilment, that kind of stuff. Imagine if you didn’t just read what God had to say, but truly <em>believed</em> it. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>There are plenty of Bible reading plans out there (there’s even one in this devotional—see SoulFood just below this reading to take you through the Bible in a year) so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in and dare to take God at His Word.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hosea 1-5, Matt 22:23-33, Ps 116:1-11, Pro 8:8-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59047&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are not your own.' 1 Corinthians 6:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Two people rock up outside a house. One says, ‘This is my house.’ The other replies, ‘How come?’ The first one says, ‘For three reasons. I built it. I paid for it. I live in it.’ For the next three days, we’re looking at three claims God has on your life. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The first claim: <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Creation</em> (‘I built it’). We usually think of this from the point of view that, if God made you, it means you’re designed, you’re hand–crafted into a beautiful, gifted, valuable child of His. That’s right, but today we’re looking at it from a different angle... If God made you, that means you belong to Him. So…?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>God cares for you! And not because of some shiny, glossy goodness of your own making, but because He made the shine that is you (Gen 1:26). You belong to Him, in a way that should both empower you, and also make you stop and think, ‘What am I doing for Him?’ Even before we look at Jesus’ sacrifice for you (tune in tomorrow), the very fact that He created you means that ‘you are not your own... therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.’ (1 Corinthians 6:19–20 NKJ) Don’t get us wrong, this is no guilt–trip. We’re saying: if God made you, and God called you His, then He knows best what you’re for. He knows the plans, the purposes and the abilities that He gave to you. He knows the problems that you’ll have to face. If you know that you belong to God, you have value, and you have purpose. What difference does knowing that ‘you are not your own’ make to the way you will act today? Think about it as you go about your day. See what happens in your interactions?</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hosea 6-10, Matt 22:34-46, Ps 116:12-19, Pro 8:10-13<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59274&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you were bought at a price...' 1 Corinthians 6:20 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>God’s second claim on your life is Calvary. There’s a story about two friends who went to law school. One became a judge; the other became a law-breaker and ended up in court. Guess who was sitting in the judge’s seat? His friend. So how could the judge be merciful, yet still be just? Taking off the black robes of justice, he walked over to the dock where the prisoner stood and said, ‘Not only am I this man’s friend, today I’m his saviour. I will stand chargeable with all his debts.’ At the cross, God took all your sin and put it on Christ’s account, and took all Christ’s righteousness and put it on your account. And the moment you trust Christ as your Saviour you’re no longer under the sentence of death. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The value of something is determined by the price a buyer is willing to pay for it. At Calvary God said, ‘This is how much I love you!’ Your Creator became your Redeemer. </span></p>

To deliver the Israelites from Egypt, He used Moses. To challenge the prophets of Baal, He used Elijah. But when it came to your salvation, God ‘saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation...’ (Isaiah 59:16 NKJ) The good news is: When God could not find a man, He Himself became a man; that we who are the sons of men, might become the sons of God.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.' 1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The third claim that God has on you is a word you might not be familiar with: ‘<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Consecrate</em>’. This means to be ‘set apart’. Being declared different, for and by God. Does this mean we need to be perfect? No, you can’t make yourself perfect, only God can and will do that someday (in Heaven). </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The step <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>we</em> have to take is the willingness to be consecrated: God is looking for people that are up for it. What does being ‘set apart’ look like? One example could be: ‘My parents want me to go to Bible College and be a minister.’ Well, there’s good news and bad. The good news is that Bible College can deepen your devotion to Christ and give you insights into His Word. The bad news is that your parents can’t ‘call’ you; only God can! ‘…no man takes this honour to himself, but he who is called by God…’ (Hebrews 5:4 NKJ)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>So, ‘How do I know where I’m meant to be?’ Basically, when God calls you, you’ll know. That nervous excitement when you know you really should join that mission? Or that sense of righteous anger that drives you to give time and/or money to a specific cause? Whatever the calling, big or small, He will open the doors, make the connections, and provide the resources. All He asks of you is that you ‘consecrate’ yourself to doing His will.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>What do you feel ‘called’ to? While you’re praying today, imagine holding that up, in your hands, to God and giving it over to Him. Now take your hands back into your chest, and receive your life back as a gift, set apart for God.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Let us keep in step with the Spirit.' Galatians 5:25 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>You know <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Singing in the Rain</em>, the musical with the umbrella twirling, puddle splashing routine Gene Kelly bit? Effortless and gliding with grace, you’d never guess Kelly was actually down with flu when he filmed it. You’d never guess the rain was shrinking his costume. Despite these odds, Gene Kelly danced into celluloid history because of the years of practice he’d put in behind the scenes. He instinctively knew the steps.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>It’s the same with our ‘routine’ with God. Every day is an opportunity to practice going toe–to–toe with Him, learning His guidance. Galatians 5:25 tells us to ‘keep in step with the Spirit.’ Put in the practice now. Spiritual guidance is learned—one step at a time.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>You might dream of making an impact in an overseas mission trip; but it’s worth remembering that God can equally move you to do ‘mission’ in <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>your own </em>town. In fact, He probably will. He has a big heart for it, because it boils down to simply living in God’s ways, wherever you are—nothing glamorous, just living for Him and for others. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>So, how can we learn God’s ‘steps’? Well, the Bible is ‘... a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path’ (Psalm 119:105 NLT). When we draw Godly inspiration from it, it’ll change our lives. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Don’t wait for opportunities to find you. Read your Bible and pray for God to give you an unmistakable passion for something He cares for.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 1-3, Matt 23:15-28, Ps 55:1-11, Pro 8:17-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59277&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fruit of righteousness will be... confidence.' Isaiah 32:17 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Apple launches a new television, confident that brand will sell. Tony Lockett would step up for a kick, confident he could get the ball through those posts. The opposition party is always confident they can run the country more successfully than the current government. The confidence that connects these three examples is self–confidence—confidence in your own reputation, abilities and bright ideas.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Isaiah is talking about a different confidence. <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>A confidence in God</em>. It doesn’t take much to shake our self–confidence—a dip in sales, a missed kick, a lost election. But ‘God confidence’ is unshakeable because God is unshakeable. It’s in His hands. If the Israelites had put their confidence in Moses, they’d never have walked through the Red Sea—only God can create corridors in seas. If Daniel had placed confidence in himself, he’d have never escaped the lion’s special recipe bargain bucket—only God can shut mouths of lions. The Bible’s packed with these amazing accounts.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Self–confidence has its limits, and it’s often the root of pride. But God is limitless. And not only will you see God’s will done through you, but it means we can’t boast about anything except Him (which helps on the pride front; we <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>all</em> struggle with it). ‘Far better to take refuge in God than trust in people.’ (Psalm 118:8 NIV)</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Who told you... you were naked?' Genesis 3:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Just how naked were Adam and Eve the moment they ate the fruit? A little bit naked? Just enough to know things weren’t quite as they used to be? One moment they were unconscious of themselves and the next they were self–conscious, embarrassed and ashamed.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The nakedness in the story seems to point to something other than ‘in all your bath–time glory’. Adam and Eve are hiding from God. Deep shame is on display here. When they mutter from the bushes about their state of undress, God doesn’t blush or look away in awkwardness. He asks them, ‘Who told you... you were naked?’ In other words, ‘Who told you there was something wrong with you?’ or ‘What’s made you ashamed to be you?’ or ‘What’s made you self-conscious?’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Self-conscious is focus on self, not on God. When He calls you, He doesn’t want you hiding because you’re too shy (read: self-conscious) to come out and keep your eyes on Him to get the job done. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Get this: God’s saying to you today, ‘Who told you… you don’t have what it takes… that you’re not clever enough… that you’re not attractive enough… or talented enough?’ Like Adam and Eve, we can believe the slithery lies of the bully or the media or even those close to us. It doesn’t matter what anybody else says or thinks about you. God’s approval is what you need.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span></span></em></strong><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>What are the things that make you want to run for the bushes and hide?

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>What motivates you? When you <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>know </em>you’re motivated, you’ll be willing to step out of your comfort zone, put overtime in and generally do the best you possibly can. Maybe it’s for that that relationship turnaround <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>or</em> exam you have to pass <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>or </em>sibling to know God’s love <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>or</em> friend to find self–worth <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>or</em> youth group to grow.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Now, if you think you know where this is going, read on, we urge you. We know that it’s not possible to always be motivated to the extreme to do all of the above in your Christian walk; it can be a long–haul that can require perseverance. But when we find ourselves lacking motivation to step out for the Gospel, we have to do something super–important: a self–review.<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> </em></span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Is there something hindering me from actually being (or feeling) free to move forward?</span></em></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>You know the ‘…the sin that so easily entangles’ verse (Hebrews 12:1 NIV)? Put it into practice. Take a look at your life and figure out what’s stopping you in body, mind or spirit. Letting go of these things gives us God–given freedom. That’s motivation, right?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Make a shortlist of things you know deep down you aren’t great at (We all have them! Sharing your faith might be a starting point for a lot of us). What do you hang onto that needs to go? God will bless you if you let Him; it’s time to open up and pray for God to move in you.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 10-13, Matt 24:15-28, Ps 38:13-22, Pro 8:24-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59282&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Clothed and in his right mind.' Mark 5:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>You might have read about Jesus healing a man controlled by evil spirits. ‘His dwelling [was] among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains… neither could anyone tame him… always, night and day, he was… crying out and cutting himself with stones.’ (Mark 5:3–5 NKJ) As creepy as this sounds, there are things we can relate to here. Really? Yes—four major things:</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>(1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>He kept hurting himself.</em> He used stones to do it, but some of us use drugs, porn/sex, alcohol, overwork or negativity. What do you keep doing that hurts you? Don’t be complacent with what’s destroying you. (2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>He was preoccupied with death.</em> The guy lived in a graveyard. Ok, that might be something you’d never do, but mentally, where are you? Living without purpose needs to be addressed—a troubled mind can bring you to the place where you lose even your desire to live. (3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>He had no peace, day or night.</em> The downside of godless living is restlessness, irritability and discontent. Nothing satisfies or is ever enough. (4) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>He lived in isolation.</em> Satan’s job is made easier when you don’t have a spiritual support system. Getting linked with other believers (that’s church, btw!) wrecks his plans.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Right, then what? Well, Jesus showed up. When Jesus shows up, things change, things we thought way beyond our ability to change. He healed him back to his ‘right mind’. This guy went from one end of the scale to another, just from an encounter with Jesus. Don’t put off your appointment with Him.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Be totally honest about how you hurt yourself. Ask Jesus for release and get care or professional help if you need to.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 14-17, Matt 24:29-36, Ps 69:1-18, Pro 8:27-29<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59290&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you come, bring...my scrolls...' 2 Timothy 4:13 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>The Apostle Paul was on another level. He finds himself locked up in prison, about to meet His maker; but instead of counting down the time till he meets Jesus face to face, he’s arranging private Bible studies: ‘When you come bring my scrolls.’ (2 Timothy 4:13) Paul understood the importance of knowing God. He wasn’t satisfied with the memories and adventures of the past, he was hungry for God till the very end. For Paul, growing and learning were a continual journey, not a destination.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Chances are you’ve sat an exam or ten. You might think they’re so stressful you’ve decided to avoid anything that resembles an exam paper for the rest of your life. But life–long learning is a reality you can’t escape if you’re going to move into everything God has for you. Staying as you are isn’t a viable option. Imagine a 30–year–old man still drinking milk from a baby’s bottle (Hebrews 5:12). It doesn’t matter where you are or who you are, the point remains: God wants you to grow, to flourish, to get better.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Thinking about how we’re ‘small fish in a big sea’ in the scheme of creation should help you to realise you have growing room. When we kid ourselves into thinking we don’t need to learn any more about God, we lose a sense of wonder about the possibilities of what we can become in God.</span></p>

Proverbs 1:5 NIV<br /><br /><p><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Here’s something to think about: growing as a Christian <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>will</em> involve walking away from things that might look good and feel good, but aren’t actually ‘good’ in God’s eyes. Ignoring that warning God’s giving you will lead to a bitter aftertaste of disappointment, distraction or complacency. Has your focus ever shifted from living God’s ways? It happens to all of us. How can we ‘grow on’?</span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Well, some of the most important things God wants to teach us go way beyond any knowledge we can learn and repeat exam–style. Our God–given passions and talents can often only be learned through experiencing tough times head–on. But would you rather experience triumph over those things that hold you back from God, or let things ‘blow over’ (which is often an excuse for letting complacency control you)?</span></p>
<p><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;>Choosing</span></em><span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;> to learn from them these experiences is important here. We all have talents, but unless you work on those God–given gifts, you’ll never know what could have been. Paul encouraged a young Timothy to ‘fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you.’ (1 Timothy 1:6 NLT) It wasn’t the time for asking for fresh revelations (see verse 13); it was time to stick on with what he’d already learnt. It’s time to work with the most of what we’ve got, and where we are.</span></p>
<p>God has given you spiritual gifts through the Holy Spirit, in addition to your natural talents. So work on developing all the good stuff you’ve been entrusted with.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 18-21, Matt 24:37-51, Ps 69:19-36, Pro 8:30-31<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59288&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be.' 2 Peter 1:8 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;>Capability without character is a lethal concoction. Just look to some of the celebrities who are ruined by drugs, money or pride. When your time on Planet Earth is up, it’s not your career but your character that goes with you. Christ–like character is what God wants you to grow in most of all.</p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;>But what does character actually look like? You could say it’s doing the right thing when nobody’s looking. Let’s face it: a pat on the back from people is fine, but watch out that you’re not riding the wave of people–approval. You never know when the compliments could come to a crashing halt. Obviously, the best example of character is found in the life of Jesus.</p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;>But how do we make character part of our lives? Peter fleshes it out for us like this: ‘Make every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self–control, and self–control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.’ (2 Peter 1:5–8 NLT) Your faith in Christ has to be more than belief in certain facts; it needs to result in action and growth, otherwise it could begin to wither. So think about the best spiritual food plan listed in 2 Peter 1:5–8. Make a note of what’s missing from your diet, then pray about how you can add it in.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.' Exodus 33:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>'I need a holiday!' usually means somebody's had enough and is about to blow their top. They're at the end of their tether. Holidays give you the rest you need to be able to function again. What difference would it make, then, to have regular 'holy days'? God shows us an example in the creation story, back in Genesis. Obviously He wasn't tired by the seventh day. He was showing us the importance of rhythm and rest.</p>
<p>In the middle of cramming for an exam? Got flatmates, siblings or parents gearing up for World War III downstairs? On the harsh end of unfair treatment? God calmly says, 'Be still and know that I am God.' (Psalm 46:10 NIV) Trust in Him. Turn the volume down on life (and the TV too if you need to), and just be with God. He knows your need, and He's got your back. He wants to share His Presence with you. So take a holy day with Him! He says, 'My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.'</p>
<p>How are you doing at taking a day off? One day a week with no work, just time to relax and 'recreate'? Trust that God will give you a boost for the week by following His command to take a day off!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 8-11, John 6:1-24, Ps 126, Pr 27:17-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56462&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will not forget how hard you have worked for Him...' Hebrews 6:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Real character is about doing the right thing when nobody's watching. Letting everyone know how hard you've been working for the Lord will bring you down on par with the Pharisees. Jesus wasn't impressed with them one bit. 'Beware of doing your good deeds conspicuously to catch men's eyes or you will miss the reward of your Heavenly Father. So, when you do good to other people, don't hire a trumpeter to go in front of you - like...actors...who make sure that men admire them. Believe Me, they have had all the reward they are going to get!' (Matthew 6:1-4 PHPS)</p>
<p>God knows exactly what you're like inside. Doing good stuff just to please others might wind you up in knots if you don't believe God's recognition is enough and He will reward you when the time is right. Do everything as if for an audience of One. You might never hear the fanfare of recognition from people but, 'your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.' (Matthew 6:18 NIV) Can your soul imagine a warmer glow than to hear Almighty God look at you and hear Him say: 'Well done, good and faithful servant'? So, choose for yourself how you'll live.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 36-38, John 4:39-54, Ps 87, Pr 27:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56456&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Above all...guard your heart... it is the wellspring of life.' Proverbs 4:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>When the enemy has backed away for a time, it doesn't mean he's backed off. He could be creating space for a battering ram. If he could penetrate your outer walls of your mind, he'll gain access to your heart and so he can occupy it and take over.</p>
<p>You're in a battle. It rages every day whether you choose to participate or not. There is an enemy who wants free access to your heart, to intoxicate it and produce all sorts of vile thoughts, attitudes and behaviours. Whatever the situation, the heart of the problem is the problem of the heart. So guarding its health is a top priority.</p>
<p>Go through an average day and chances are you'll get shot down once or twice. Disappointment, discouragement and disillusionment are always on the prowl. (Maybe it isn't a coincidence that 'Dis' is another name for the Greek god of hell, Hades. His family also includes disease, disaster, disapproval, discontent and so on. They too are always on the prowl.) But with God, you can be wise to these assaults. The best way to do that is to make sure your heart is filled with God. Jesus wasn't just reciting poetry when He said, 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.' (Matthew 5:8 NIV) Knowing God is so important because it shapes everything that we become. Jesus offers you life in its fullest sense, so don't settle for anything less.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 13:21-22, 1 Sam 16, 1 Sam 17:32-51, 1 Sam 24:1-17<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56457&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I consider everything a loss...compared to...' Philippians 3:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Belonging to God doesn't mean you'll be able to waltz through life, a red carpet unrolling in front of you. Becoming a Christian comes with a cost, a call and a challenge.</p>
<p>Commitment doesn't mean just popping #TeamJesus on your twitter bio, handy as it might be. The truth is, lots of people are standing at the sidelines of Christianity, looking in and thinking how nice Jesus is. Occasionally they give God the odd shoutout out Facebook. But when it gets down to living life out-and-out for Jesus, suddenly they're reduced to a mumble about 'not being a crazy Biblebasher' or 'but I'm one of the normal ones', or even: 'when I'm older'.</p>
<p>Some people, when they decide to give Christianity a proper look, see Jesus stands with His arms open wide, offering friendship, offering strength, offering real change. Even fewer still decide to take Him by the hand, and stick with Him for life. But for the ones that do, life becomes a huge adventure. Everything is set on fire by the breath of our fiercely good God, and power fills them to the brim. Are you completely won to Christ, committed to the call and having counted the cost? Or - are you still at the sidelines?</p>
<p>There are enough Christians in the world to win it all for God. How many of them are worth the name, though? Think: is your faith just about trying to be good or giving your all in friendship with Jesus?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 39-40, John 5:1-15, Ps 41, Pr 27:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56459&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have worked...been in prison...been flogged.' 2 Corinthians 11:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus didn't even get a glorious heroic kind of death, but one of ridicule and mockery. Even as He was nailed to the cross, naked and abandoned by His closest friends, the people around about were having a go at Him. Even one of the thieves who was crucified with Him joined in. Good thing then, Jesus didn't come to earth for the banter. He came to live <em>for us, </em>and then to die <em>for us</em>. From washing filthy feet to dying the worst possible death, Jesus' life was an ongoing example of sacrifice.</p>
<p>And the call goes out from the cross, to us, today, 'Will you come with Me? Will you follow Me? Will you give up everything for God, loving others enough to show them the way to Me?' The decision to follow Christ isn't one where we tick a box. It is to make Christ the absolute purpose of our lives, to make Him the thread that every action and word hangs off.</p>
<p>It comes with power. It makes your life an entire whole, rather than lots of little parts. It gives you meaning and value. But it's a serious thing. Every aspiration, every dream, every hope is shattered and reshaped by the call of Jesus, and becomes something new in Him. Is it time for you to take up the challenge? If it is, turn to the inside back cover.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 1-3, John 5:16-30, Ps 15, Pr 27:10-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56460&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have suffered the loss of all things.' Philippians 3:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Who is Jesus? A great teacher who spoke with an authority like no one else? Yes, of course! The sick healed and hungry stomachs filled? Sign me up! Jesus' radiance and joy drew great masses of people to Him. The crowds loved Him. But then He started talking about 'taking up your cross'. Not once, but <em>daily</em>. Their faces dropped to pale grey. 'Give up your life,' He said.</p>
<p>It wasn't about loving Him in a vague sort of way anymore. It was time to be wholly taken up in His mission, to make Him the out-and-out purpose of their lives. He got excuses - 'Pardon me while I straighten things out at home first' - but He didn't cut anyone any slack: 'Anyone who starts...and then keeps looking back is of no use for the Kingdom of God.' (Luke 9:62 GNT)</p>
<p>Don't make excuses. If you don't go for it, it will be your loss, not God's. He'll just invite someone else on the adventure that could have been yours. Don't settle for second best. Fullness of life requires sacrifices. Some will be big and some might be small. But all of them will be worth it. Our tip? Don't fix your eyes on what you're being asked to give up, look at the One who asks - He is faithful.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 4-7, John 5:31-47, Ps 5, Pr 27:13-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56461&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I try to find common ground...' 1 Corinthians 9:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>The truth isn't always cool. Sometimes people just don't want to hear it. But there are times when you've got to stand up and be counted, and wade in for justice, for the good of people who are being mistreated.</p>
<p>But be careful. Hypocrisy can be sniffed out a continent away, and you won't find anyone taking you seriously if there's a whiff of it on you. Think of the famous pastors caught red-handed in immorality, having spent every Sunday decrying sin from the pulpit. The other thing you've got to be aware of is your audience. Have you fully understood both the situation and the people involved? Make sure you're honestly trying to help for the good of others, not just fingerpointing.</p>
<p>So how do you balance the truth with grace? If a challenging conversation stems out of a relationship based on love and respect, you'll have loads more influence. The truth is a powerful thing, but unless you harness it in a loving heart, you might make people run and hide. Tactfulness is more than saying or doing the right things at the right time, it's avoiding saying or doing the wrong things at any time.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 12-16, John 6:25-34, Ps 85, Pr 27:20-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56463&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.' Proverbs 13:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>Laziness is treated pretty seriously throughout the Scriptures. Maybe you talk the talk more than you walk the walk - or simply have a habit of putting things off. The (shocking?) truth is that laziness is a sin.</p>
<p>It's true that 'it is by grace you have been saved' (Ephesians 2:8 NIV), but this isn't an excuse to kick back and sleep through life. The very next verse explains that we're saved for a reason: to <em>live </em>for God. To be transformed. To boldly show others the way to Him. It's all well and good to say, 'Phew, God airlifted me right out of that mess,' but remember that it was God who jumped into this world's mess, because He loves us, and wants to transform us rather than dump us.</p>
<p>So let's not kid ourselves that God wants us to chill out and just watch Him work: sure, Christianity is full of big blessings for us, but our love for God should see us hungry to join in!</p>
<p>Remember that being a Christian is having a relationship with God - and that He wants you to take an active part in His plan: Operation '<em>Kingdom Come On Earth</em>'. So, get active in your devotion to your Heavenly Dad! Become a formidable force for the King of Creation, become someone to be reckoned with! Take a deep breath and get stuck in. Great reward waits for you if you do.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 17-21, John 6:35-51, Ps 98, Pr 27:23-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56464&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... He knew what was in a man.' John 2:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus put in hours of prayer, effort and time loving His disciples, and for what? When His hour of need came, they were nowhere to be seen. But despite Peter's denial and an en masse letdown by His mates, Jesus didn't regret His effort Nor did He retaliate in anger or distance Himself from them.</p>
<p>Jesus took his friends just as they were and that always meant there was potential for hurt and disappointment. But this wasn't a deciding factor for Him. He loved them from the start to the end. And that meant having reasonable expectations of them, knowing what we humans are like (prone to getting it badly, badly wrong!) So He didn't lose the plot, even when they did. At the same time, He didn't lower His own high standards. Jesus loved without conditions or pressure. You can do it too. That may be easier to say than do, especially when someone's doing your head in. The perfect relationship, the perfect job, the perfect boss, the perfect church, the perfect neighbourhood, the perfect school, the perfect friend - none of them exist! God knows that and He never commands you to do something without giving you the ability to carry it out. Through the process of loving others, He promises you'll become more like Him. Is there someone in your life you need to be more gracious towards? Be real with God and allow Him to lighten your load.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1:8-18, Ruth 2:5-12, Ruth 3:1-6, Ruth 4:9-13<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56465&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... He knew what was in a man.' John 2:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we looked at how the disciples were all works-in-progress, just like you and me. Now we're looking up - and seeing who Jesus really is. He's not a work-in-process, but the uncreated totally amazing complete God of all. In Revelation 4:15:14, there's a stunning description of Him in Heaven. Before you dwell on your own struggles, challenges and frustrations, take the time to look at God, and put Him first place in your mind and life.</p>
<p>The biggest temptation we all face is to put ourselves on the throne within our hearts. It's human nature for God and others to slip down to second place.</p>
<p>Sometimes the feeling that life is treating us unfairly is really a loss of perspective. Romans 12:3 NIV tells us, 'Don't think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgement.' It's clear God doesn't want you wallowing in a pity party, looking inwards. But what does He want? He wants to catapult you into place as a son or a daughter of the King described in Revelation 4 &amp; 5. The Sovereign King of the Universe is your heavenly Dad. What a perspective to have on your life, looking outwards and upwards, not inwards in self-interested pity. And what a God to look up to! Do you have it and know it? If not, look up!</p>
<p>Read and familiarise yourself with Revelation 4 &amp; 5. Try to get a picture of the greatness and goodness of God in your head. Then, ask Him to lock it in.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 22-25, John 6:52-71, Ps 127, Pr 27:25-27<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56467&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor...' 2 Corinthians 9:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Giving, particularly when you're young, can be tough to do. As little kids we don't need to give, we just demand everything we want or need and most of the time we get it. But where's that changeover point? At what age do we stop demanding our rights from our parents and start to think about what we can give to others? It's interesting that the Bible doesn't seem to think it is an age thing. It simply tells us we should give; especially to the poorest of the poor.</p>
<p>'He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.' At first you may wonder what on earth that's about. A lot! God is totally committed to loving and healing a hurting world, and the most exciting part is He's got a part for us to play in that plan. God's concerned about the poor and making sure everyone gets a chance to hear the amazing news of the Gospel. And He has chosen you to be a part of His strategy to take care of this messed-up world! What an opportunity! Can you really believe God doesn't want to just do it all Himself, He wants to partner with you?</p>
<p>So think today about what part God wants you to play. Think you have no cash? How about running a sponsored event to do what you can. There are a thousand great causes to give to - there's one where He especially wants your partnership. Just ask Him which it is.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 26-29, John 7:1-13, Ps 114, Pr 28:1-4<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57470&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you...' Deuteronomy 31:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Surely God would only send those He could trust into enemy territory. Understand this: God cares about where you are. He has selected you for your school, college or work environment. He is currently equipping you or already has. Your parents shouldn't think of sending you off on a school camp without getting you everything you need while you're away. And God definitely wouldn't! Sometimes nasty environments can be overwhelming but by God's grace we can thrive in them! If you'll take God with you and keep your identity in one piece, the enemy will lose ground. Don't let him keep you focused on everything that's doing your head in: gossip, peer pressure, being bullied, friends falling out, incorrect homework, a nasty teacher or boss. The danger is that you'll focus on the discomfort of the moment and miss the blessings that lie beyond it. While you're praying for God to change your circumstances and take away your problems, He's saying, 'If only you knew what was waiting for you. Your purpose and destiny are only moments away and, though they're not wrapped in shiny paper, they contain all you'll ever need to reach your goal and bring Me glory.' God understands us so well. He knows all about our desire to stay in one place when things become so comfortable that we just don't want to move! Often He has to trouble the waters so that we'll reach out to Him in desperation and as a result, tap into strength and success we never knew possible.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 30-33, John 7:14-24, Ps 104:1-23, Pr 28:5-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57472&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.' Mark 6:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>The shops are full of masks, costumes, blood and other 'fun' items to help little kids enjoy Halloween. Some Christians have meetings to declare 'victory over the darkness' but others take their kids out to take part in 'trick or treat'. Whatever you think about Halloween, there's no question it's a night of celebration for Satan and behind the 'fun', it's a very important night for those involved with witchcraft and the occult.</p>
<p>Halloween is not a night to be feared. How about seeing it as a wonderful opportunity to introduce people to Jesus? It's the one night of the year that everyone wants to believe in the supernatural so rather than slam the door in little kid's faces, let's show them the power we have! How about door-knocking and asking if the neighbours would like prayer instead of saying 'trick or treat'? How about a party to celebrate Jesus where the kids are dressed as things from the Bible (an ark, a whale, a dove, a fish and so on)? Let's not teach people what we're against without showing them what we have - a magnificent, glorious and beautiful God that has totally beaten Satan already! Instead of a few magic tricks our God can heal the sick, cast out demons, raise the dead to life and give us eternal life - plus He's alive and with us right now! Why would you settle for a moment of 'fun' when He can give you a full and awesome life, if only you turn to Him?</p><br /><br />SoulFood (All Saints' Eve): Deut 18:9-18, Dan 2, Isa 47:5-15, Acts 16:16-34<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57473&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgiving each other, just as...God forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>There's this raging river you need to cross. The water is a thundering torrent like Niagara Falls, but fortunately there's a bridge to take you to the other side. It's so high and massive you won't even have to turn on your windscreen wipers to remove the spray. Then you press that button on your dash labeled 'Fire Nuclear Missile' and the bridge explodes in front of you.</p>
<p>Who in their right mind would destroy the very thing they needed to get across the river? Yet people act like this every day when they refuse to forgive. A clergyman once said, 'He who cannot forgive others, breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself.'</p>
<p>The power of forgiveness is an awesome thing. No relationship can survive without it. Forgiveness sets both sides free and takes a missile out of Satan's hands. It opens the way for God to go to work in the situation so you can be where He wants you to be. Forgiveness needs to start with family. It's easier to forgive an enemy you don't see often than someone you live with every day. Paul writes: '...Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love...' (Colossians 3:12-14 NIV) As for anger: '...Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:26-27 NIV) In other words, forgive when you are hurt, and don't take your resentments to bed.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 34-37, Jn 7:25-44, Ps 104:24-35, Prov 28:9-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57474&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgive whatever grievances...' Colossians 3:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Christian walk isn't easy. So many of us keep going with a slight spiritual limp, a pocketful of guilt and a backpack of unworthiness and yesterday's sins. 'And I will remember your sins no more,' we read in the Bible. But have you ever heard the little ghost whispering from the cupboard? <em>'Ah, yes, but what about that time you exploded in anger? You embarrassed God that time...'</em></p>
<p><em> </em>'As far is the east is from the west, so He has removed our transgressions from us,' we might sing in worship time. But the ghost sitting in the row behind us bends forward to say, <em>'He removes other people's sins. But He shouldn't have to with you. He really expects more of you. You should know better...'</em></p>
<p>When we're asked to share something up the front, we hear a whisper accusing us of hypocrisy. And if we ever think of becoming a missionary, the ghost seems to choke on its caramel latté: <em>'You! A missionary?!' </em>It's as though we kinda believe God forgives us and remembers our sins no more, and we kinda don't. The waspish voice of the whispering ghost seems true, too. This is a sure-fire way to lead a life of keeping your head down, and never rising above your failures and doubts. If the message of the Cross seems a little too far-fetched at times - grace for <em>you, </em>yes<em> you!</em> - then confess your mess to God. Now try praying as if God really has no memory of it. Start praising, praying and living like you really have nothing to worry about!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 38-41, Jn 7:45-53, Ps 9, Prov 28:13-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57475&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves...' Matthew 14:24 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The disciples were out in a boat on the Sea of Galilee. They knew its moods well - they'd been fishermen on its shores and even been out one time with Jesus when the mother of all storms had hit. He'd calmed the wind and waves with just a single command. But this time was different - He wasn't there. He was up on a hill praying. The winds were so wild it seemed to the disciples like the grandmother of all storms had hit. They knew from past experience the lake could be churned up like a blender for a couple of days. Knowing they were unlikely to survive this one, their fear turned to terror when they saw what they thought was a ghost. Do you feel like you're in the middle of a 'perfect storm' like this? Are you tossed by the waves of worry, terrorised by the spectre of the past? Jesus can calm it all. And His first question will be the same as that He asked the disciples as He arrived so unexpectedly: 'Why did you doubt?' (Matthew 14:31 NAS) Jesus' complete confidence in God's protection is something He wants us to get hold of for ourselves... Whatever is happening in your life at the moment - whether your boat's going under because of worry, you've got a storm over money, a job, a test or a friend - well, the man walking on the water towards you is Jesus. Not a ghost. Jesus is walking towards you telling you to 'take courage'. Take your eyes off the waves and fix them on Jesus.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 9:1-19, 2 Cor 11:21-33, 2 Cor 12:7-10, Phil 3:4-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57477&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus...went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.' Acts 10:38 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The storm was still flinging the waves around in fury when Peter said to Jesus: 'Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.' And Jesus said, 'Come.'</p>
<p>For a minute, as Peter climbed from the boat he must have forgotten the bullying waves. He must have forgotten the boisterous wind. He must have forgotten there was nothing beneath his feet except 43 metres of water.<em> </em>But there must have been a moment when it all came rushing back and he thought, 'Thank you, laws of nature, for serving up a dangerous reminder. Thank you, wobbling balance. Thank you, logic and reason. Thank you, scary sea, for strangling the life out of me.'<em> </em>After that thought, it got pretty hairy pretty quickly. He must have wondered why on earth Jesus invited him out of the boat in the first place. 'Lord, save me!' he cried, as he started to sink. And Jesus reached out His hand and caught Him.</p>
<p>It would have all been fine if only he'd kept his eyes on Jesus. So here's the super simple lesson for you and me: <em>Superglue your eyes towards Jesus.</em></p>
<p>The storms of life will come. Keeping your head above water depends on where you fix your eyes. When you are staring into the face of loneliness, or disability, or anxiety, the waves seem ferocious. Keeping your mind fixed on Jesus will be the difference between floating and drowning.</p>
<p>So start your day reminding yourself God is always with you. Finish it that way too. And keep it in mind at every moment in between.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 42-44, Jn 8:1-20, Ps 96, Prov 28:17-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57478&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You will also declare a thing, and it will be established for you...' Job 22:28 NKJ<br /><br /><p>We talk to ourselves. All the time. Not so much in the crazy-muttering-to-self kind of way but in the self-fulfilling prophecy kind of way. We cast judgments on ourselves, telling ourselves how fat or ugly we look, how croaky or stupid we sound - and sometimes how much better we are than other people. These words would be sad, but they would also be no real problem if they didn't have real-world consequences. Unfortunately sooner or later we discover that, 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue...' (Proverbs 18:21 NKJV)</p>
<p>Self-belief isn't an exclusively Christian thing (and come to think of it, self-doubt certainly isn't either.)</p>
<p>The difference for us who know there is a God - a God of love who created us, and who also created a sacrifice system, which He then fed Himself into in order to reclaim us (yes, that means you, too!) - is that we have a serious stamp on our self-worth. Relationships, Education, Career: this God-approval of you is meant to flow into every area of who we are.</p>
<p>So, make an active choice to agree with God's statement of how worthy you are. Give up casting judgments on yourself (or on others) and change your life by first beginning to change your thoughts. Remember what Job says: 'You will...declare a thing, and it will be established for you.' So, starting today, serve an eviction notice to every negative thought that's holding you back. Instead, begin feeding your mind with God's Word.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 45-48, Jn 8:21-30, Ps 86, Prov 28:21-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57479&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... from one degree of glory to another...' 2 Corinthians 3:18 AMP<br /><br /><p>Want it <em>now</em>? Instant glamour, instant muscle growth, instant weight loss, instant... hey, it doesn't matter what you want, someone out there in internet-land will promise you pretty much anything instantly. So what about instant faithfulness and godliness? Well, that's a different story. We're so used to getting things without working for them, but how can we possibly hope to become a shining reflection of God's glory, a beacon of Spirit-inspired faithfulness for His kingdom?</p>
<p>If you can't see how to make the giant leap - as if from the earth to the moon - it's because you're not meant to. Our journey is meant to be step by step, authentically ours, worked out by God's Spirit in us. It's not a fast track ticket - it's from one degree of glory to another, growing all the time - sometimes so slowly it's hardly visible and other times with a sudden spurt. And while we're not meant to work for it (and can't anyway, because it's all about the work of the Spirit in us), the rate of glory-growth is directly connected to our intake of God's Word. As we allow His Word to direct our decisions in life, the great news is that God does the hard work for us. We are <em>being</em> transformed 'from glory to glory' (2 Corinthians 3:18 ASV) - our part to play is to be up for it! It's to choose God and His glory at every opportunity. Don't be put off by the 'step by step' thing, it's God's strong plan for you to shine solidly with Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 49-52, Jn 8:31-41, Ps 30, Prov 28:25-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57480&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They gather gossip, and...spread it...' Psalm 41:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>There was a famous Greek philosopher (philosophy = 'the love of wisdom'... <em>cooooool</em>!) called Socrates. The story goes that a man approached Socrates one day to share some gossip. The wise philosopher asked, 'First, are you certain it's true? Second, is it something good? Third, is it something useful?' The man said, 'Not really.' So Socrates replied, 'Well, if it's not true, good or useful, why talk about it?'</p>
<p>Socrates knew that talking about someone else brings unnecessary nastiness. This principle is covered in the Bible too. David said, 'They visit...as if they were my friends, but...they gather gossip, and...spread it...' (Psalm 41:6 NLT) Solomon said, 'Gossip separates...best...friends' (Proverbs 16:28 NLT), and it can cause you to lose 'your good reputation.' (Proverbs 25:10 NLT)</p>
<p>If someone comes to you to confide in you, or if you come by someone's secret story, how do you respond? Even before you've finished hearing it, are you already working out who you can share it with? Or is your heart breaking for them, and you're already inviting God into the situation within your heart? A rule for breaking confidentiality is this: you can't keep a secret if somebody (<em>including</em> the person telling you) is at any risk of being harmed. Even if they ask you to. But, if that's not the case, what are you gaining by passing the secret on? Does that person actually need your prayers, and your encouragement? A test for you next time you get some juicy info: imagine whispering it to Jesus. What would He say to you?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 53-57, Jn 8:42-59, Ps 123, Prov 29:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57481&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Along unfamiliar paths I will guide them...' Isaiah 42:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>The problem is simple: so many of us confuse the Bible's teaching of 'God is love,' with a sentimental chocolate-box understanding that translates into 'God is soft-centred.' The love of God isn't like gooey fudge. The love of God is sometimes hard, like nails driven into a wooden cross. So when we find ourselves in trying times, God doesn't always lift us out of it on a sweet-scented breeze. Sometimes, out of love, God lets us endure the situation, in order that we might overcome our greatest fears.</p>
<p>Paul puts it better in Romans 2:4 NIV - 'Do you make fun of God's great kindness and favour? Do you make fun of God when He is patient with you? Don't you realise that God's kindness is meant to turn you away from your sins?'</p>
<p>To be a Christian means to want to be like Christ. Jesus didn't run away from pain. Whenever you're tempted to, you should work out why first. Sometimes, God allows us pain as part of our glory-growth and character-cultivating. Sometimes, God allows us to go through pain because He wants us to repent and come back to Him: this is the most loving thing He could ever do.</p>
<p>Know those times when you're waiting to get to sleep at night and can't stop mulling over the day? Tonight, think back to what you were like before you met God. Think about how God has brought change in your life and character. Be encouraged - the path ahead might be unfamiliar, but it's the same God leading you along.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 58-62, John 9:1-12, Ps 15, Pr 29:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57482&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?' Amos 3:3 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Perhaps marriage seems a long way off to you today. That means you're in the <em>best</em> place to start chewing these ideas over, while you've got loads of time to put them into practice...</p>
<p><strong><em>E</em></strong><em>njoy</em>. Really simple starter: do you enjoy the same things? <strong><em>V</em></strong>. Agreement on boundaries, children, how to manage your money, life-dreams, and your relationship with God are make-or-break issues. <strong><em>A</em></strong><em>ccessibility</em>. Are you both emotionally accessible, or is one of you the strong silent type who doesn't communicate - or understand the other's need to? <strong><em>L</em></strong><em>ove</em>. Not the Disney Princess version but the kind that overlooks faults and failings, and shows itself through a naturally bubbling-up kindness? <strong><em>U</em></strong><em>nderstanding</em>. Can you understand and handle each other's differences? <em><strong>A</strong>ppreciation</em>. Your partner can't read your mind. It's not just nice, it's necessary to tell them you appreciate them. <strong><em>T</em></strong><em>emperament</em>. If your default mood is 'go' and theirs is 'hold back', it'll come back to bite in you in less patient moments... <strong><em>E</em></strong><em>nvironment</em>. If you're from different backgrounds, have you talked through how you'll solve the pull of those different cultures?</p>
<p>Don't worry, we're not suggesting you go out hunting right now... Most of us are still trying to work out who we are, let alone how we relate well to that special someone. But this is some practical commitment advice for when you need it. So, if you want a happy marriage, E-V-A-L-U-A-T-E these things.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 63-66, John 9:13-23, Ps 115, Pr 29:7-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57483&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Given to hospitality.' Romans 12:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Welcoming people and making them feel loved and valued is an important aspect of being a follower of Jesus (John 13:34-35). God's Word tells us to practise 'hospitality'. But do we know what it means? (No, it's not about first aid or doing a hospital run.) If you are a warm person, chances are you'll be good at this welcoming hospitality thingie. If kindness is top of your priorities, again you're probably practising hospitality without even knowing you're doing it. And if you can't stand it when somebody new comes along to your church service and they're left alone sipping weak coffee in a quiet corner, well, hospitality is clearly what floats your boat.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:10 NKJ suggests that Christians are part of 'the household of faith.' What kind of 'household' do you most like visiting - one where you're kept at the door in the freezing rain or one where you can kick your shoes off and have a good natter over coffee and tim-tams? 'Hospitality' is choosing to welcome folk into our fold. 'Hospitality' walks over to the quiet corner to chat to the church visitor. 'Hospitality' invites the loner out to the cinema with the rest of your mates. 'Hospitality' always puts the kettle on, no matter who is knocking on your door.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 1, Job 2:7-10, Job 40:1-5, Job 42:7-17<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57484&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['No matter how fast you run, you won't escape. No matter how strong you are, you will lose your strength...' Amos 2:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>Ever had that dream where you're running away from someone but you just can't lose them? Scary, isn't it? Well, what about when you live your life like that? Are you trying to outrun a problem but are never quite able to shake it off?</p>
<p>Today's verse warns us to face up to our problems because running away from them will only tire us out. Kristin Armstrong says something similar: 'We become...adept at running... We try to flee from our pain, our past and our issues. The problem is, we can't run or hide or push things away forever. Eventually we'll tire...and have to slow down. And when we do, all our junk will come rolling behind...headed straight for us at top speed. All the time we've been fleeing, our junk has been snowballing...picking up size and momentum. If we aren't brave enough to face it when it's small, it'll run us over later. Now's the time to...deal with it... as fast and as strong as you are, you can't keep this up much longer.' Whether your problem is physical, mental, financial or spiritual, it's better to confront it now rather than be bulldozed by it later. So, if you need to, admit you have a problem. Your next step should be to get help. Share your problem with someone you respect and trust. And bring God into the situation.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 1:1-3:20, John 9:24-41, Ps 99, Pr 29:11-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57485&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The believers met together in the Temple every day...' Acts 2:46 NCV<br /><br /><p><em>Question</em>: Do you get itchy if the meeting goes over an hour, or the preacher takes an extra 10 minutes? Is one meeting per week your limit? And think about it: does this attitude look anything remotely like the Church that the book of Acts glows on about?</p>
<p>Those discipley guys and gals met together in the temple <em>every day</em>. 'They spent their time learning the apostles' teaching, sharing, breaking bread, and praying together.' (Acts 2:43 NCV) Church group wasn't a hobby, or a part-time commitment. So what was the secret? What drew these faithful fellowship-fans? Was it their cutting-edge media presentations on plasma screens? No, perhaps it was their awesome youth group programme, with teaching you could also get on an app. Of course not! So was it their brandname? Ah, maybe it was that their lives were easier, and they were just kicking about with nothing else to do? Nope. Everything about their lives was harder, took longer, and was less convenient. (Try looking up the ancient Hebrew word for 'dishwasher').</p>
<p>And yet their encounter with Jesus had transformed their priorities so much they hungered to gather in the presence of God. They rejoiced in His promise: 'That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.' (John 17:21 ESV)</p>
<p>Taking God seriously means spending time with Him. Meeting other Christians, hearing His Word together, and encouraging one another (Hebrews 10:25). It's a time thing. And it's a together thing. Make this time-and-together thing a priority for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 3:21-6:23, John 10:1-10, Ps 133, Pr 29:15-18 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57486&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The believers met together...and shared everything...' Acts 2:44 NLT <br /><br /><p>The first Christians took fellowship seriously. It wasn't like an after-school netball team or a facebook fan page for pizza. The world may not understand, may not see anything in the Church except people meeting together who share an interest in spiritual matters. However, 'Church' is a trillion times more than that. Church is family - <em>blood family</em>. The cross made it so. The blood of Jesus that saves you also connects you to every other believer.</p>
<p>And those early disciples really valued that relationship. It was more than singing hymns together. How about this: They 'met together...shared everything they had...sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.' (Acts 2:44-45 NLT) What? That was Church?! Does this look like your experience of it?</p>
<p>The early Church survived incredible persecution and achieved amazing things. Why? Because they understood the need to value each other, and to sacrifice personal interest for the sake of the whole. As isolated, self-reliant, self-promoting individuals they would have been destroyed by the overwhelming force of their enemies. As a believer, you may survive apart from the church, but you can't thrive. Your God-given potential will never be realised until you commit wholeheartedly to a local fellowship and invest yourself in serving God's vision for that church.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rom 7:1-9:16, John 10:11-21, Ps 83:1-8, Pr 29:19-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57487&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All the believers devoted themselves to...prayer.' Acts 2:42 NLT <br /><br /><p>If all the believers devoted themselves to prayer, what exactly did they do with the other 23 hours and 55 minutes of the day? Or wait! Actually five minutes of prayer before they went to sleep probably wasn't the way to establish a church that has lasted over two thousand years...</p>
<p>This word, '<em>devoted</em>', seems to imply they were <em>dedicated</em> to prayer. It wasn't an afterthought or just something to humour God with every now and again. Prayer was a treasured part of being a Christian. Prayer meetings attracted huge groups of people. There must have been something exciting about it to become such an important part of the first church. Do you find it too hard to imagine what it must be like to give up everything we have and share it with others? Well, that's because we can't imagine praying hours upon hours every day. Prayer changes something in us for the better.</p>
<p>Consistent prayer lifts us to a higher, positive place where we learn how to achieve more while at the same time experiencing deep peace of heart and soul. Jesus said: 'Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.' (Matthew 11:28-30 NIV) What are you waiting for?<strong> <br /></strong></p>

(Acts 2:42 NCV) Researchers tell us that, today, personal Bible reading is less common among Christians than prayer. We've tagged-out a word from God that empowers us for the challenges of the day, and tagged-in 'going to the gym' and 'energy drink' or 'cappuccino'.</p>
<p>For too many of us our only Bible input is our pastor's Sunday sermon (or the title verse of a <em>word4U2day</em> reading). Compare that to the early disciples, in a world where being able to read was rare, and a Scripture scroll of just one book would cost the same comparatively as a luxury car today... The early disciples were so committed to the Word that they spent [invested, paid the price with] their time, learning [studying to understand and master] the apostles' teaching. That meant that not only did it build them up to face everyday challenges, but when persecution made them fugitives, they took the Word with them to new churches they planted around the world (Acts 8:4).</p>
<p>When Jesus started His earthly ministry and began revealing what God is like, He didn't pull out a guitar or put on a course in miracles. He read from a Bible scroll (Luke 4:14-22). You want to know God? You want to understand the big picture? Read your Bible. Start with today's SoulFood reading.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...My unfailing love for you will not be shaken...' Isaiah 54:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Today open your Bible, get God's opinion of you and build your life on it. 'Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet My unfailing love for you will not be shaken...says the Lord.'</p>
<p>The world around you, the one made up of things as solid-seeming as mountains, hills, and Saturday afternoon job shifts, will dissolve away one day. It's true. But long after the universe-as-we-know-it winds up for good, this verse tells us something will stand unshaken and very real - a force standing firm to be reckoned with. A 'fixed point in time', if you will, <em>Doctor Who </em>fans.</p>
<p>That fixed point, that long beam of light that shines through your life from one end to the other, is God's kindness. He's locked up that kindness in a trustable, 'future-proof' covenant with you. This means He won't go back on it, even if the world were to fall apart (which, uh, it will, at some point). <em>This </em>is the answer to the anxieties and niggles that keep you up at night. If you've ever been bothered by fears of death, <em>this </em>is the secure comfort your Father has given you: the assurance His love comes from somewhere deeper than this reality, and long outlasts your earthly 'best-before' stamp.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I bear him witness that he has a great zeal...' Colossians 4:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Where are you at today? If your interest in church and Christianity is waning, this one's especially for you. Are you finding the idea of living an independent life off your own bat much more appealing? Are worship and Bible-reading starting to feel more like a 'blah' than a blessing?</p>
<p>A good way to begin a change is to let God know. Really! God's all about honesty. If you're thinking about checking out completely on this Christian gig, consider asking God to persuade you otherwise. It's a win-win! Sincerity goes a long way with Him. Chances are He'd love to show you that solid happiness is found in living His way.</p>
<p>Also: learning to come at your faith from a different angle is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, trading in church-ianity for the real, rich depths of knowing God <em>can't</em> be a bad thing. When you get real with God, He may well awaken a hunger for Himself in you, and begin a desire in you to eagerly search for Him.</p>
<p>So don't give up on your Church life, if you have one (far from it! God longs to know you through the other Christians you hang out with) but build on it! Add in friends, the beauty of nature, a good piece of music: these are great places to experience God too. He is always speaking to you, and always seeking for you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He...guided them in the wilderness...' Psalm 78:52 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In a wilderness it's a struggle to move, water is scarce, and you plod on with no end in sight. Your average Duke of Edinburgh trip is a handy Scriptural metaphor for spiritually miserable times. Yet you can have a wilderness experience anywhere: at a graveside, at the Job Centre, or in a particularly messy breakup.</p>
<p>In a wilderness you can feel like an actor who's forgotten the right lines. 'A Christian should act in a certain way, speak in a certain way, pray in a certain way... but I just can't do it right now!' But it's there, as you're standing frozen on-stage, that God reminds you from the prompter's box: 'Remember Me. Remember what I've done in the past. Remember how I've dealt with you. Hasn't it all been for your good?'</p>
<p>After clinging to His Father in a doubly-real wilderness, Jesus burst back out of the desert clothed in the power of God's Spirit, ready to launch His power onto an unsuspecting world. And God can turn your life around like that too. 'He...guided them in the wilderness...He led them on safely, so that they did not fear...' (Psalm 78:52-53 NKJ) If your life is a whole lot of wild nothingness right now, stand on His promise: That if you love God, He will work all things together for your good (Romans 8:28). So, remember God's Word in the sidelines of your life (this could be especially in the moments when you're feeling most low) and He will give you strength (Psalm 119:28).</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be afraid...I am with you...' Acts 18:9-10 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you out yourself as a Christian, it's the rejection of friends and family that hurts the most. It can put a fog over your faith. And in the middle of that fog the last thing you want to do is keep telling others about what a huge part of your life Jesus is.</p>
<p>When Paul tried to share his new faith with his old friends, 'They opposed him.' (Acts 18:6 NKJ) It seems like Paul was so stung by their rejection God had to encourage him, saying, 'Do not be afraid...I am with you, and no one is going to...harm you.'</p>
<p>BUT.</p>
<p>Yeah, BUT...</p>
<p>Something fairly amazing happens when we get serious opposition. In Psalm 23:5 NLT, David said, 'You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honour me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings.' What's he saying? That when enemy fire reached point-blank range, God set up an all-you-can-eat buffet bar. Uh... what?</p>
<p>In the times when we feel ourselves most under fire, God doesn't just reassure us, He gives us a double-whammy of His presence and His blessings. And He describes it as a 'feast'. The very time you feel you want to give up could be the time you most need to wait on God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The world and all that is in it is mine...' Psalm 50:12 NRS<br /><br /><p>'...God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.' (Genesis 2:7 NKJ) The bottom line is: We're God's. We're owned by Him as part of His creation, with the gift of His creative spark breathed into us. But, as CS Lewis writes in <em>The Problem of Pain,</em> fallen human beings always 'want some corner in the universe of which they could say to God, &quot;This is our business, not yours.&quot; But there is no such corner.'</p>
<p>The problem with that is that when you decide to leave God's territory, there's nowhere else to go! 'Independence' sounds ideal to a sin-smeared humanity eager to get out of the blaze of God's sight. But we often confuse rebellion with independence. True independence is a bilateral agreement whereas rebellion is a unilateral declaration. So the sort of 'independence' that means walking away from the One who breathed life into you is really rebellion that leads to a dead-end brick wall. The only territory is God's. Any other 'territory' - anywhere where human beings say, 'I'm the king of this jungle' - is an illusion. And as creatures, not Creators, the only right way to live is stitched back into the one who first breathed life into us.</p>
<p>Is the stamp of His ownership over everything in your life, as He designed it to be? Where are you saying, even quietly, 'This bit is my business' to God? Today is the day to turn it over to Him.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[tap-into-your-creativity]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God created man in His own image...' Genesis 1:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Creativity is simply doing something well - in the best way that <em>you</em> would do it. But isn't it funny how little we tap into that God-given creativity? Think about all the jobs left half-done, all the imaginations left alone since childhood. Other people might be more educated and experienced, but they don't have a monopoly on creativity. No one does - only God. And He has freely created people in His image. That means you!</p>
<p>Creativity is a gift of our God-reflecting identity. It's a shame when this gift gets shunted aside. Maybe you feel called to paint, preach, play a piano, build a business, nurse, farm... or whatever. Make the leap and do it. Don't think about doing it, don't plan to do it... just take a step! If you wait until you can do it perfectly or without criticism, you'll never do it.</p>
<p>Walking on water begins with one step of faith. Doing what God's designed you to do also brings you closer to Jesus. You see, Jesus wasn't in the boat during the storm. He was out on the water, saying to His disciples, 'Come.' (Matthew 14:29 NKJ) Only one of them did: Peter. And though he did it imperfectly, it changed his life. Creativity is like that. So don't be afraid, tap into your creativity and watch what happens!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 1-3, John 12:12-19, Ps 102:1-11, Pr 30:18-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57504&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Enthusiasm without knowledge is no good; haste makes mistakes.' Proverbs 19:2 NLT <br /><br /><p>Motives matter. Enthusiasm on its own means nothing. If you're rushing into Christian habits without knowing God, then you'll plant your face in failure. You'll keep tripping up over what seems to come naturally to the Christians around you.</p>
<p>It's a mistake to rush into a faith life without first knowing God. In fact, it could do more damage to your soul than good. But don't despair! This is a 'redirect-your-sights' message. Acquaint yourself with Christ before making any attempt at 'trying to be a Christian' - otherwise it'll be like trying to play the drums without a sense of rhythm.</p>
<p>Your soul was made to be at rest in God. So get yourself settled with Him first. Let your soul become close and familiar with Him. Would you rather have the strain and stress of developing all the highest evangelism skills, prayer teams and missionary giftings in the world - or the sort of life where these things come naturally to you because you're consumed with God and delighted to be with Him?</p>
<p>God is calling you - but He wants you to know Him first of all, before you work for Him. How are you responding to that call right now? Are your priorities right?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let my words and...thoughts be pleasing to You, Lord...' Psalm 19:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>Did you wake up today ready to live for other people? Good. Did you wake up worried about pleasing other people? Hold on a sec before you head out the door...</p>
<p>They might sound like similar things, but they're really not. The Bible says, 'Fearing people is a dangerous trap...' (Proverbs 29:25 NLT) Always being worried about what other people think about you, and trying to please them in case they secretly hate you - that comes from fearing people. If you find yourself unable to say 'no', even when your friends are exploiting you - that comes from fearing people. If you find yourself being way too 'loyal' or reliant on a boyfriend or girlfriend just to get some validation - that comes from fearing people. If you're always wanting to get a laugh because you're worried people don't like you - yep, that too comes from fearing people.</p>
<p>Remember what Paul says, 'When I was a child...I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.' (1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV) A mature Christian will want to live for other people. But only when they've got their priorities sorted - the first thing they'll be concerned about is making sure that their 'words and...thoughts' please God. Confidence in God's love for you will lift you above all the miserable anxiety that comes with fearing people. Ever heard of people long ago who were described a 'God-fearing'? Sounds like they were more concerned about God's rules than His love, doesn't it? But all you have to do to live a 'God-fearing' life is to be more bothered about what God thinks than what people do.<strong></strong></p>

<alias><![CDATA[try-a-bit-of-thankfulness]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['In everything give thanks...' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Today, try to start a habit of saying 'thank you' (out loud, if you can) for as many things as you can manage. People who fill their lives with gratitude for the ordinary things of life become dispensers of serious joy. Not just the words 'thank you' - the words aren't magic. But making space and time to offer God little, sincere 'thank yous' in your day will change you; it will make you slow down, and take time to notice the way the world really is.</p>
<p>Why 'in <em>every</em>thing give thanks?' The best things in life are those God gives us the most of-the quiet things that make up the fullness of ordinary life. (Isn't breakfast wonderful?! It's supercalifragilistically seriously scrumptious! And yet, most every day we battle through it bleary-eyed...) God gives us lives generally made up of relationships, sleeping, eating and getting on with work. We take them for granted, and forget they're supposed to be rewarding in themselves. It's worth being reminded that even the most basic things in life are from God, and if they're from God, they must be <em>good</em>. Thankfulness does that.</p>
<p>Wondering how to get a bit of life in your faith? Maybe, simply, try being thankful. Remember, '...the joy of the Lord is your strength.' (Nehemiah 8:10 NIV) When you take joy in all of the little things He's given you, your life lights up, and you get legs for your faith. So, have a shot at thanking our Father God for as much as you can, right now. See how it goes!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...You will not grieve like people who have no hope.' 1 Thessalonians 4:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Death. Even reading the word can set your emotions running. And when it comes to the subject, it's easy for Christians to dodge the bullet and escape into wishy-washy, irrelevant-sounding talk.</p>
<p>But God doesn't do that. Listen - these are His words: 'Dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died, so you will not grieve like people who have no hope.' The Bible is direct and concrete on this subject. From God's perspective, it is still a tragic thing, and a horrible thing, for His children to go through here on earth. He knows it. It's not part of His original plan for humanity. But hope is always the final word: God says, 'Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they will rest from their labour, for their deeds will follow them.' (Revelation 14:13 NIV) In Jesus, there's far more to death than just tragedy, it's a triumphal entry into Heaven. Death will open the door for Him to enjoy perfect friendship with each of His precious ones, forever. God gets it that, when we lose a loved one, we can forget: '...whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.' (Romans 14:8 NIV) It doesn't take away from how hard it is, but we can trust that our Lord takes good care of what belongs to Him.</p>
<p>And remember: hope is God's final word over death. The resurrection of Jesus is His promise for us. Jesus didn't cheat death, He conquered it.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...God will bring back with [Jesus] the believers who have died.' 1 Thessalonians 4:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>God says there'll be a day when He'll wipe away all tears (Revelation 21:4). He's given us that promise because, frankly, tears are a given with life on earth, and He wants to remind us that He didn't mean it ever to be that way. So even in the worst pain, we can know that no silent tear is wasted, no gut-wrenching heartbreak goes unnoticed, and no sighs of despair are ever without hope. Why?</p>
<p>(1) '<em>We believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again.</em>' (Thessalonians 4:14 NLT) All hope begins here: the fact that He died and lives again. And we follow in our Master's footsteps! So it makes sense that when we die, there'll be a day when we stand up on our feet again. We will live again too.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Since we believe this, we also believe that, well... Jesus returns!</em> He's alive now, so it's not the end of the story. His return to earth, in an actual physical body just like first time around, gives us confidence that 'God will bring back with Him the believers who have died.' God will put us back in actual bodies, just like Jesus (Romans 8:11). It won't be re-incarnation: our spirits going to different bodies. We get our own back-perfected! 'He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own...' (Philippians 3:21 NLT) Imagine that! It almost sounds too good to be true. All the old things-pain, crying, death-will pass away. You'll stand up on your feet again, and you'll be at home at last, in God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We tell you this directly from the Lord...' 1 Thessalonians 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>A few years back, comedy actor Ricky Gervais starred in the film <em>The Invention of Lying</em>. The storyline of the movie is that there's a place everyone tells the absolute truth all the time - until one day, Ricky's character realises he can say something that's not true. Later on, his dying mum asks what happens when you die. To comfort her, he makes up a story about Heaven and God. As the concept of lying doesn't exist in this place, she and everyone else believes this story wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The sad message behind this movie is that the writers genuinely 'know' Heaven's just a lie made up to make people feel better about dying. It's a fairytale - in real life, so they tell us, there are no happily-ever-evers!</p>
<p>If all we had was the <em>idea</em> of Heaven, we might be tempted to doubt its actuality too... But our belief in it is locked into a far more trustworthy experience of God's reality. When Paul wrote today's passage about death, he heard straight from the Lord.</p>
<p>For those in relationship with Jesus, death is nothing to fear and Heaven is a certainty. And in fact, death is just the beginning! This truth should give us the confidence to live without fear of the end, as well as be motivated to share the truth with those who don't know Him. So, pray for someone you know who has yet to put their trust in Jesus and for an opportunity to talk about God with them. <strong></strong></p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...To go and be with Christ, which would be far better...' Philippians 1:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>One of the most well known quotes of the apostle Paul is 'for to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.' (Philippians 1:21 NIV) But what does it mean? Let's be honest, few of us really want to die. There may be moments when life seems particularly woeful and dying genuinely feels like it wouldn't be so bad. But most of the time, we're quite happy to live and go on living.</p>
<p>So, if living is Christ, what does that mean or look like? For Paul, it quite simply meant all of his life decisions were made 'for Christ', rather than for his own benefit. He lived as much like Christ as he possibly could. He did his best to love people and live generously. He delighted to share the Good News of God's grace with as many people as possible as often as possible - despite the consequences, abuse and imprisonment he faced. He encouraged, corrected, learned, taught, and never ever put himself first.</p>
<p>Paul lived the way he did by imitating Christ, and that's precisely what we should do too. Copy Jesus. If you're not sure what to pray, then pray as He did. If you want to see miracles, pray for the sick. Love people. Feed the hungry. Build relationships. Spend time with the Father. Give generously. Learn as much as you can and live to serve.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 20-23, John 14:1-14, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 31:10-13<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57980&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' 2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>In 2 Corinthians, Paul challenges the Christians with the example of the Church in Macedonia: 'the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. I testify that they gave...even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord's people...They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us.' (2 Corinthians 8:1-5 NIV)</p>
<p>When was the last time you saw a bunch of Christians fighting over giving to the offering plate? On the contrary: many a Christian has a reputation as someone who never tips, someone who buys a drink for themselves without offering to bless others and someone who ignores the homeless 'because they're bound to waste any money on drugs'! Paul saw Christ in the Macedonian church because they knew full well that all they had was by God's grace and they couldn't wait to be 'God's wallet on earth', distributing money the way He wanted.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' 2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Our giving should spring from gratitude for what Christ has done for us. Paul writes: '...though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.' (2 Corinthians 8:9 NIV) Understanding how generous God is to us is important, because some of us give Him our leftovers. If anything remains after we've paid the bills and done everything we want, we'll give. But even a million dollars, if it's out of our leftovers, is hardly our best. Some people are 're-givers'. Re-givers receive a present they don't want, then wrap it up and give it to someone else. That's how some of us approach giving to God - and it's an insult! In the New Testament you don't see preachers begging, selling stuff or using gimmicks to raise money for God's work. What you see is people like the Macedonians responding to God's grace because they understood and loved the God they served. Everything God created was meant to give. He created the sun to give light during the day and the moon and stars during the night. He created flowers to give seeds. God Himself is a giver: 'For God so loved the world, that He <em>gave</em>...' (John 3:16 KJV) When you understand grace, your situation takes a back seat. Your giving is not determined by your spend-to-income ratio. No, it's motivated by God's grace!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Children are a blessing.' Psalm 127:3 CEV<br /><br /><p>Our families can be seemingly endless, tremendously complex or virtually non-existent. Every single person is a product of their own upbringing and unique experiences. This can make people incredibly talented in their particular roles or it alternatively lead to the feeling they fall very much short. Good or bad, we're still supposed to love 'em.</p>
<p>In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus' mother Mary and her other sons came looking for Him. When He was told, Jesus said He was already with His family: 'Anyone who does the will of My Father in Heaven is My brother and sister and mother!' (Matthew 12:50 NLT) Jesus wasn't being mean and He hadn't fallen out with His family either. He was showing us that, when we choose to make God our Father, we get a new family and we are related - by His blood! Just like your earthly family, your spiritual family will have people you love and people that drive you up the wall. However, just like an irritating big brother or mean cousin, we're called to have patience, understanding and love for them anyway.</p>
<p>Do you know some Christians who are just driving you nuts? It's time for some action. Practise praying blessing on them... you will soon discover how you feel begins to mysteriously change!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the words of the wise bring healing.' Proverbs 12:18 NLT<br /><br /><p>Colossians 4:6 NKJ says that our words should be '<em>seasoned with salt</em>'. Salt has two primary purposes: it preserves and it adds flavour. This means that our speech should preserve and bring health to all who hear it. It should bring life to the soul, not destroy, harm or upset.</p>
<p>This is very hard to do if what's in your heart is negative, bitter, angry or jealous. James says, '<em>You can't draw fresh water from a salty spring</em>.' (James 3:12 NLT) In other words, you can't fake what's in your heart. It's not just a question of learning to say the right things; it's about that right attitude going all the way down to the core.</p>
<p>Words are powerful. A single person can impact someone's entire life with a throwaway comment such as: 'You don't know what you're talking about.' If we have a low opinion of ourselves, it's easy to feel our words have no effect - that no one listens. But in truth, whatever you think about yourself, your words will have an impact on others. Watch your words carefully! Keep a mental check of the words you speak today, and whether they're spoken thinking about other people's best interests.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be careful to do what is right...' Romans 12:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jeremiah writes, '<em>Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means... in the end he will prove to be a fool</em>.' (Jeremiah 17:11 NIV) It's easy to think that it's ok to do whatever you like as long as it's small and no one notices. Whether you steal a dollar or a million, you're still sinning against someone, and against your heavenly Father. Each little sin chips away at your integrity.</p>
<p>And integrity is costly. If you want to be someone who's got it, you need to act with it... from this point onwards, if you haven't done so before. You also need to deal with baggage you've built up for yourself in your past. If you don't, then you can almost guarantee that, as pressure increases in the future, these hidden things will come to a head.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to act with integrity: (1)<em> Keep your promises</em>. (2) <em>Acknowledge your mistakes.</em> When your decisions don't turn out the way you intended, you owe people an explanation. (3) <em>Apologise and try to make amends</em>. When your actions hurt others, you need to admit that what you did was wrong and say you're sorry. It's virtually impossible to move on, if you don't.</p>
<p>It's time to be honest about your honesty. What hidden mistakes do you carry - those that make you feel sick when you remember them? Confess and put things right so that you can move into integrity. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 30:25-31:55, John 15:18-27, Ps 65, Pr 31:25-27<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57985&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.' Joshua 24:15 NIV<br /><br /><p><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The ‘Great Commission’ is probably one of the most misquoted passages in the Bible. Before He ascended to Heaven, Jesus didn’t instruct the onlookers to go and preach the Gospel but to go and ‘...make disciples of all the nations…’ (Matthew 28:19 NLT) There’s a difference! God <em>can </em>still work wonders in someone’s life, if you dump the Gospel on them and run. However, His instruction to you is to walk with others through solid long-term discipleship, investment and teaching (which is so much more rewarding anyway!)</span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Some feel called to ‘evangelism’ and others to ‘discipleship’, but the truth is we’re all called to both. A gift of evangelism is not a cop-out for avoiding the long hard road of discipleship. A gift of discipleship is no excuse to step back from sharing the good news with people who need to hear it. Youth and inexperience isn’t an excuse because however little you may feel you know, <em>there are people who need to hear it from </em>YOU.</span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Are you being discipled? Jesus’ ministry was all about investing in a few who, in turn, invested in a few and so on. It’s so vital that, if we’re to grow as Christians, we have someone mentoring, challenging and investing in us. It’s through this that we learn, grow and have a safe space to discover God’s purpose for our lives. The challenge today is to look at your own discipleship both as a learner and a teacher.</span></p>

All that is needed is a small foot in the door, a lapse of concentration, a silly decision made in a mad moment and we’re skidding down slippery slopes at a serious pace.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus...cleanses us from all sin.' 1 John 1:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, '<em>a nearby neighbour can help you more than relatives who are far away</em>.' (Proverbs 27:10 GNT) One of the problems we face in our modern society is the disposable nature of relationships. Even the relationships that should be permanent are easily undone. Some children have a conveyor belt of 'fathers'. It seems easier to get a divorce than change your broadband service provider. For some people friendships sit at the bottom of the relationship loyalty scale, just below your mobile phone supplier and doctor, with no commitment required.</p>
<p>Yet there are examples throughout the Bible of covenant friendships - relationships where unbreakable promises were made to one another. These are God-given, beautiful and life-giving relationships. David and Jonathan were friends who swore they would care for and protect each other always. Naomi promised Ruth she would follow her and never leave her alone... and she never ever did.</p>
<p>Children easily promise to be 'BFFs', but as we get older, life usually moves us on. Maybe as we grow up, we need to look out for a BFF or two. Choose wisely, and when the moment is right make a verbal commitment - a covenant: an agreement with no get-out clause. Give it to God and see how He uses that united friendship to do together what you could never have achieved alone. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 37-39, John 17:1-26, Ps 147:1-11, Ecc 3:5-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57988&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.' Romans 4:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Few of us tend to go automatically to God when we're disappointed. Instead of prayer as our default mode, our knee-jerk reaction, we tend to wait until the disappointment fades a bit and we're able to lick our wounds ourselves. Maybe deep down inside, we aren't fully convinced He wants to help us, or maybe we just think He can't.</p>
<p>Do you think He can? Even the most devoted Christians can still lack faith when disappointment strikes.</p>
<p>We tend to outfit God in human qualities that are just plain wrong. We expect Him to be annoyed or get tired of us. We think we ask Him for too much. Fight the doubt with truth: the fact of the matter is that God <em>is</em> able to help. He <em>is</em> bigger than our problems. He <em>does</em> understand. God <em>wants</em>to help us. '<em>Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.</em>' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJ) God calls you a friend. You don't annoy Him. He <em>wants</em> you to depend on Him, to ask Him for help. He cherishes you. He adores you. Why is that so hard to believe? Wait on Him - it's so worth it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are God's masterpiece...' Ephesians 2:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Before life happened, before we started to worry about what we looked like, before we began to measure ourselves up, before we were hurt, before we felt like we had to prove something... wasn't it nice to be a kid?</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>If you believe in Christ, you are God's own child. There is nothing you can do to be in this <em>Kid-of-God Club</em>, you just are! When you say you aren't good enough, or you are willing to compromise what you believe to fit in, you're disagreeing with God, second-guessing His taste. You are telling Him - God, the Master of the universe - that what He did is not good enough. Because Jesus died on the cross for your sins, God sees you as innocent once again, like the child you once were (better, even!) Because you matter to Him, and there's nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Got a mirror? Look at yourself. What does God see in you? He sees His child. If you have one of those crayons that works on glass (or a dry-wipe marker), write on the mirror: 'I matter, because God loves me.' Say it out loud. You matter. Because God loves you. #Score.</p>

But guiding and helping isn’t a task that’s only for mentors. As Christians, we can all call each other out - so long as it’s done with grace and wisdom - point each other to God, and teach each other things we’ve learned. And bonus points: teaching others helps that same good advice to sink in to you.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid...' Hebrews 13:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Worry' can be a real troll. Give it a centimetre and it'll take half the galaxy. Give it five minutes, and BOOM! Meet your mind's new tenant. And is it loud! First thing in the morning, last thing at night, it's drumming right in the forefront of your thoughts, squelching your peace and robbing you of all joy.</p>
<p>As a follower of Christ, you have the authority to serve worry an eviction notice and it must leave. The only thing that enables it to stay is your ignorance of that truth. When your mind is occupied with God's Word, worry sees a 'no vacancy' sign and moves on.</p>
<p>Paul says, 'For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.' (2 Corinthians 10:3-5 NKJ) The weapons God has given you to fight with are greater than the fears you face. But you must know your weapons, keep them in good repair, and be able to use them.</p>
<p>God wants us to have peaceful minds. Filter your thoughts like your words. Do they bring life or death? If the thoughts bring worry, reject them.</p>

Hopes and dreams need more than a vague sense the world owes us some sort of destiny. But we also can't run ourselves dry chasing after them. There has to be somewhere between the 'Let's-take-on-the-wooorld!!!' and the 'I'm-gonna-slump-on-the-couch-and-eat-a-sanger' approach to life. Let's see...</p>
<p>(1) <em>Short and sweet</em> - give it all up to God. Then He'll kick back any dreams He doesn't see as worth your time or His glory.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Live today, as it is </em>- not as you think it should be.</p>
<p>(3) <em>Set small realistic goals</em> that can be reached, but don't be afraid if they require you to stretch a little further than normal. Maybe you'll surprise yourself.</p>
<p>(4) <em>Don't spend forever trying to get one little thing of your life perfect</em>. It's about healthy living, not obsession. And finally, what about - -?</p>
<p>(5) <em>When you mess up</em>: Oh, wait, you aren't perfect? Well, surprise. Neither is anyone else. It's ok. Promise.</p>
<p>(6) <em>When you give up</em>:<strong> </strong>Find your worth in God - not what you can do, or how you look, or what things you have, or what other people say.

<introtext><![CDATA['We have different gifts, according to the grace given us...' Romans 12:6 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Peter Brock was one of Australia’s best known and most successful motor racing drivers. During his career ‘Brocky’ won Bathurst nine times and was crowned Australian Touring Car (now V8 Supercars) Champion on three occasions. Because of his success and driving skill he earned the nickname ‘Peter Perfect’. Despite his immense driving skill, tragically a motor racing accident took his life in 2006. Brocky was definitely a gifted driver but he’d be the first to admit he wasn’t perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>‘We [all] have different gifts’ - so what are you doing with yours? You may never win a motor race but we all should work hard at developing and extending the gifts God has given to us. However the Bible also clearly warns us against ‘trying to become perfect by your own human effort.’ (Galatians 3:3 NLT) It’s not going to happen! ‘We have different gifts, according to the grace given us.’ When you strive to be somebody other than the person God intended, you end up feeling angry, inadequate and frustrated. God purposely gifted us all in different areas. Once you realise that, you can start to minister from your particular area of giftedness. Remember, every one of us is a work-in-progress, so cut yourself some slack. Instead of trying to become perfect, begin to thank God for making you one-of-a-kind.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 50, Haggai 1-2, John 20:1-18, Ps 105:1-7, Ecc 5:13-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57994&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will set before my eyes no vile thing...' Psalm 101:3 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Story time. One day the Queen needed a new chauffeur. The first guy she tried out did pretty well in the interview, so she let him take her out for a spin in her Audi. Driving up a windy mountain road, she told him to drive as close to the edge as he could. Thinking he was hot stuff, he went about 30 cm from the edge. He was proud of himself, but the Queen wasn’t satisfied. A second bloke came in for the job, she asked him to do the same thing. This guy got even closer - 10 cm - to the edge. But the Queen kept looking. A third driver was interviewed, and she once again told him to drive close to the cliff. ‘With respect, Ma’am, no way,’ he said. ‘To keep you safe, I’m staying as far away from it as I can!’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>He got the job.</span></p>

We should think like that third driver: don’t even go there. Stay away. Don’t play at the edge of sin. Keep messing up? Get out of there! Do you struggle with porn? Don’t go on the internet alone - don’t make it easy to look at what you shouldn’t. Do you struggle with drinking? Don’t touch the stuff - stay away. Because when you play on the edge of sin, you <em>will</em> fall off. Guar-an-teed.</span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Come clean.<strong> </strong>What is that one thing that just keeps coming back up over and over? What would it take to get rid of it? Ask a friend to keep you accountable, and take the steps to get there. Today. Like, right now.</span></p>

Wouldn’t it be nice if things - like money, food, clothes and stuff - just showed up? So what’s the point, why bother? I’d rather go back to the couch and eat another sanger.’ Ok, there’s a point to hard work. Really.</span></p>

God created paradise, then He created us. THEN, He put us to work. Don’t believe it? Genesis 2:15 says that God put man in the Garden to work it. That was before the Fall - God made man to work even before man had sinned! Whatever you’re doing - whether it be school, uni, work - you are doing it for Him. So ace it.</span></p>

We’re ready to be done with working, studying, just - life. We all know that feeling. But the good news is there’s hope. You have a God who gives strength, and who keeps you going. Work hard, but make sure you are doing it for God and not men.</span></p>

Think again. There are many things that get us places, not just smarts.</span></p>

When you trust the talents God has given you, you’ve got more confidence you can do all things through Him. And confidence is attractive. People notice! A second thing is <em>Curiosity</em>. This just in: <em>you don’t know everything</em>. Yup. We know. But, when you don’t know something - ask questions. If there looks like a problem can’t be fixed, don’t give up. Keep going - find a way. Curiosity is eagerness to know, learn and understand more. The third thing is <em>Decisiveness</em>. The Bible said God didn’t make you to be a squeaky little mouse. (Well, ok, alright, it doesn’t say <em>exactly</em> that... but that’s what it means.) He did not give you a spirit of fear. He didn’t make you to be afraid. Of people. Of circumstances. Of life. He has given you Power. He has given you Love. And He has given you a Sound Mind. So use them! Fear makes us pull back and run away from tough situations. But with God, we can lean forwards into them with confidence.</span></p>

Is there something that excites you, but you haven’t explored it yet? It could be painting, or running or astrophysics? Do yourself a favour, and do something about it. Go for it. Ask questions. Don’t be afraid to try new things. God has gifted you and given you interests because He wants to use them.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Luke 1:26-56, Luke 2:1-52, John 2:1-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57997&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Colossians 3:12 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Success. Ahhh, feels good. But how do we get it? A few little hints for school, uni or work: (1) <em>Empathy</em>: Take a second to think about others. Want to succeed? Always show consideration for other people’s situation, needs, feelings and perceptions. This not only helps you, it helps them. Imagine how it would look if we all genuinely looked out for each other? Well, it starts with you. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Yes, <em>you</em>! </span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You - the one reading your little smartphone, looking at <em>word4U2day</em>’s website or holding this devotional in a magazine. Stop looking to other people, and start with yourself. (2) <em>Flexibility</em>: Can you touch your toes? Congratulations. But that’s not what we are talking about. If you want to succeed, sometimes you’ll have to roll with the punches, float with the tide, drift with the wood. Weren’t expecting that thing to happen? Flexible people will go farther in life than those who break when they are bent. (3) <em>Humour</em>: Hey, find yourself worked up too easily? It’s ok to laugh. Ok, there <em>is</em> a time and a place to laugh - there always has to be a balance between seriousness and fun. Look for the humour hidden in life’s serious moments and you’ll find it. People who are dispensers of misery are like a wet blanket - not fun. Oh yeah, and smile. When you learn how to laugh, it makes life, just, better. And here’s an extra tip about how to get far in life: remember people’s names. Someone’s name is one of the biggest things that assigns them honour as a person. Maybe you’re a bit forgetful about names. It takes work, but if you remember someone’s name, it shows you care.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 1-4, Luke 1:1-25, Ps 105:23-36, Ecc 7:5-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57998&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Yes, working in an orphanage in Cambodia would be Christian work. But then so also is clocking on for a 2-10pm shift at your local fast food joint. The thing that makes the work Christian is <em>you</em>! Cleaning an orphan baby’s nappy, while you curse your project leader in your head over and over again, is <em>not</em> Christian work. Serving a burger, while lending your colleague a shoulder to cry on, and praying for each of your customers, <em>is</em> Christian work.</span></p>

Chances are you won’t be in this place forever. But for now, try and find meaning in it. Ask God to help you express your faith in a meaningful way in your workplace. So, whether you feel stuck in school, a dead end job or out of work, start viewing your time as a missionary.

In Never-Never Land nobody recognises him anymore. A slanging match ensues as all the boys shout, ‘This is not Peter Pan!’ Amidst all the noise, a young, blind boy takes Peter by the hand and pulls him down to his level. Placing his tiny hands on Peter’s face, he touches the skin on his face and, for a second, glimpses the boy he once knew. ‘There you are, Peter!’ he says. For a moment, the years of worry are gone. And Peter Pan is found once again.</span></p>

Perhaps you’re not that old or overweight but you’re not the person people once knew. Maybe there was a time when you couldn’t keep quiet about your faith, but now nobody even knows you’re a Christian. Maybe you used to love ‘being there’ for people but now you’re far too busy with your own issues. Maybe you used to have a spring in your step but nowadays you walk tired, bogged down with life’s worries. If this is you, God wants to take your face in His hands and say to you, ‘There you are!’ Draw close and He’ll pull back the stresses from your life.

Today’s proverb hints at that. We’ve all got a friend who doesn’t care who they upset. Well, <em>don’t</em> be that friend! The book of Proverbs has good advice on being a friend: ‘<span class=&quot;text&quot;>The sweet smell of perfume and oils is pleasant, and so is good advice from a friend.</span>’ (Proverbs 27:9 NCV) ‘As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.’ (Proverbs 27:17 NLT) Do you ever show your friends how much you value them? How? What’s a practical way you can honour your friends today?

So, James is suggesting, if you’re looking for where God’s heart is, it’s with those who are mourning a loss. Jesus also teaches that God’s heart is turned in favour to those grieving: ‘<span class=&quot;woj&quot;><em>God blesses those who mourn, for they will be comforted</em>.</span>’ (Matthew 5:4 NLT)</span></p>

(And breaking up from a serious relationship is a kind of grieving too - today’s reading may be more relevant to you and your mates than you first think...) Nothing you can say will bring the loved one back. Nothing you say will stop the grieving. So maybe words aren’t something you need to offer. Maybe you just simply need to be there. Silently, ‘<em>weeping with those who weep</em>.’ (Romans 12:15 NLT) Explanations and cold theology aren’t what the broken-hearted need: ‘<em>How can your empty clichés comfort me?</em>’ (Job 21:34 NLT) But your love, your sympathy, your presence can speak a thousand words your mouth never could.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 14:6-11, Acts 4:8-12, Acts 16:22-34, Matt 1:18-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58005&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

He spoke, and beauty and perfection sprung up all across the star-sprinkled universe. On the third planet from the sun, the rivers teemed with life, the sky threw out creatures of the air, the ground raised up living beings. And then God clasped His hands and set about His prize jewel. ‘I’m going to make My masterpiece.’ He smiled, as He dreamt up human beings.</span></p>

Stop looking in magazines or ads and comparing yourself to the airbrushed, photoshopped models in them. Instead remember: you were made in the image of the perfect God. How good is that? Do you struggle with how you see yourself? Why is that? Ask God to show you how He sees you.

<introtext><![CDATA['Good news...for all the people.' Luke 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The life of a shepherd in first century Israel was not to be envied. It was a thankless task - people looked down their noses at ‘agricultural specialists’ like these. They were poorly paid - so perhaps it won’t be a surprise to know they weren’t all men. Lots of women looked after sheep in the cold fields, guarding them overnight from predators. So, when God chose to be born in the stench of a cattle-shed, it’s no wonder the angels bypassed the universities and theological colleges and churches to announce their good news to these lonely figures on a hillside. Men and women who probably felt forgotten suddenly discover that God has offered them a supreme honour: for thousands of years, so many Israelites had wanted to be the first to hear the Messiah had come. No one suspected a bunch of smelly shepherds would be the chosen ones.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>God is down-to-earth in more ways than one. The text tells us God is with us, whoever we are. Today God isn’t in the tinsel and trappings. He is with the homeless man on the streets. He is with the lonely pensioner in her flat. He is with the drunk on the park bench. He is near the addict too. He is in the midst of all of us but, wherever there is a forgotten figure on a spiritual ‘hillside’, God’s heart is particularly there. And this Christmas we could be His messenger of good news. The pair of socks we buy for the homeless guy tells him God is with us. The visit to the lone pensioner tells her God is with us. Joy to the world. Emmanuel. God is with us.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood Christmas Day: Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6-7, Matt 1:18-25, Micah 5:2-5a<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58010&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Modern science screams at us: <em>impossible</em>. And then God chooses to grow fingernails and soft elbows in amniotic fluid. Common sense tells us: <em>unlikely</em>. And angels watched on as <em>God</em> had His soiled nappy changed. Reverence says: <em>Not on my shift</em>. And middle-eastern astrologers spend months crossing deserts on the promise of a light in the sky. Conservatism says: <em>all sounds a bit new age-y to me</em>. A few sheep and their guardians hear about it, but the rest of Bethlehem have no idea. Logic whispers: <em>far-fetched</em>. And within thirty years He’s stretched upon a cross for the things you and I will do wrong in a few thousand years time. How on earth are we expected to buy a tale like this?</span></p>

Is there any other that tells a story about a loving Father God willing to enter into the mess and do whatever it takes to put it right? Whatever it takes. So long as the ‘whatever’ has nothing to do with violence but is all about love, mercy, grace, justice, truth and peace. Peace on earth. That’s His message. Not so much ‘Merry Christmas’ as peace on earth.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 29-31, Luke 2:8-20, Ps 117, Ecc 10:15-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58012&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Think of them as an image for <em>guilt</em>. We all make mistakes and do stuff we later regret. Guilt is the yapping dog that blocks our path and barks at our feet.

God doesn’t operate that way. He didn’t have Jesus’ arm behind His back in order to be born in a manger. Jesus didn’t give the blind sight and the deaf hearing because He felt guilty if he didn’t. God didn’t guilt-trip His Son into dying for you. So if you’re feeling a ten-tonne weight of guilt around your neck, it hasn’t come from God. The kind of ‘sorry’ God is interested in doesn’t come from self-pity and browbeating. A ‘God-sorry’ is about spotting and stopping behaviour, not just for your own good but for everybody’s. Technically, this ‘God-sorry’ is called <em>repentance</em>. It means turning away from wrong-doing. It’s the ‘sorry’ that lifts your chin up again to carry on with life. Jesus said, ‘<em>Go, and sin no more</em>.’ (John 8:11 NLT)</span></p>

You’re not impressing anybody, or doing yourself any favours. Say ‘sorry’ and enjoy God’s work in your life. Now take seriously God’s instruction to change that bit of your life.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 35-37, Matt 2:9-15, Ps 139:1-12, Ecc 11:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58017&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

You’re in love again! But are you really? If you’re head-over-heels before you’ve even deleted the ‘you’re dumped’ text, chances are you’ve found the perfect rebound relationship. Know what? Rebounds are often a dangerous way to prolong a hurting situation and create an innocent victim. The person you’ve got your eye on now could be more of an elastoplast than a soul-mate.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: right 333.0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Jumping into your next relationship too quickly is sure to spell trouble. A toddler doesn’t go from crawling to driving overnight, nor should you go from heartbreak to wedded bliss overnight. Sure it’s nice to feel ‘wanted’ again, but at what cost? Repeating the same mistakes as last time? Using another person’s emotions to flatter your own ego? Using intimacy to feel desirable? You shouldn’t rush your own feelings nor try to force God’s hand. Solomon writes, ‘<em>Promise me... not to awaken love until the time is right.</em>’ Don’t be in such a hurry to take the edge off your pain that you run ahead of God. It takes time for Him to make you into the person He wants you to become. While He’s working on you, He’s preparing the heart of the right partner to show up at the right time.</span></p>

And when it doesn’t happen on our timetable, it’s tempting to rush into another relationship hoping it’ll make everything better. The last couple to ‘live happily ever after’ may have been Snow White and Prince Charming! The real failure is not in falling down but in staying there when you have fallen. Jesus told His disciples to shake the dust from their failures and move on. It’s good advice. Don’t become caught up in your failures. Don’t become condemned to repeat the past. Learn from your mistakes and move on. Paul said the same thing in Philippians: ‘<em>Forgetting what is behind… I press on</em>.’ (Philippians 3:13-14 NIV)</span></p>

You might think she would have got the picture by that stage but she was pursuing yet another relationship. Jesus laid it on the line for her: her need was not another man, but a relationship with God. He said, ‘<em>No one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again</em>.’ (John 4:14 CEV) Jesus saw beyond her sin to her real need, and restored her sense of self-worth.

Matthew 9:2 NAS<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>How do you know when something is wrong for you? Because it makes you want to run and hide in the bushes from God. When you’re about to do something you’re not sure is <em>totally</em> right (but you’re not sure is all that wrong either) there may come an uneasy feeling, or a nudge within you. Understanding that is very important, especially in those morally-grey moments that start to stack up as you grow older. Sometimes it may be God prompting you, other times just your conscience. Maybe sometimes it will be neither.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Whether you’re convinced it’s The Lord or not, the best course of action is always to go to His Word. God will always be chuffed with a Christian who’s first reaction is to see what He has said, especially when they’re unsure. As you grow in understanding, God’s Word will continually direct you in how to respond to all of life’s icky situations (Psalm 119:105). A layer of temptation that comes with sin is to hide yourself, Adam-and-Eve style, in the nearest foliage, or tuck yourself away in a corner far from His gaze. Though you’ll find grace even in that corner, don’t let it get that far. That ‘spidey-sense’ for sin will save you many a shameful moment.</span></p>

God’s moral law isn’t an alien thing to the human race (consciences come in handy for that) and even less so for His children. If you’re anxious about ‘accidentally’ sinning, chances are you’re already on the right page. Simply be like David and say: ‘<span class=&quot;text&quot;>Y<em>ou are kind, God! Please have pity on me. You are always merciful! Please wipe away my sins</em>.’ (Psalm 51:1 CEV)</span></span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Job 40-42, Matt 3:1-12, Ps 116, Ecc 12:13-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58023&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Hebrews 3:7-8 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Have you ever watched somebody trying to help an injured animal? In its pain, the animal doesn’t realise the person is attempting to rescue them and often strikes out at the hands offering help. Sometimes when we’re in pain, our reactions to God and others around us are not so different. Two things can keep us backed into a corner, hurting, yet reluctant to reach out or receive a helping hand:</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(1) <em>Trust</em>. Sometimes things hurt so much you stop trusting anybody, including God. You stop reading the Bible, avoid those who want to help and refuse to let anyone pray for you. Yet God’s Word says that when we trust in Him we will be saved. When we call we will be rescued and ‘...not disappointed.’ (Psalm 22:5 NCV)</span></p>

It’s not so easy to ask for help when you have an image to maintain or you believe others will think less of you if you ask for support. Pride can be dangerous. It can keep us from receiving help for days - or even years - putting our spiritual lives at risk because we ‘will not turn back to the Lord...or look to Him for help in this.’ (Hosea 7:10 NCV) As this New Year starts, make a simple resolution: <em>Don’t harden your heart against God or strike out at others when they offer help.</em></span></p>

Go on.

We can struggle with feelings of unworthiness when we are dearly loved. We can even receive Jesus as our Saviour, then doubt our salvation. The truth is our feelings are often rooted in our deepest fears: that the sin we committed was just too big for God; that we’re not loveable; that we won’t get to Heaven when we die. We don’t feel secure in our faith because we are living in fear, not in love.</span></p>

His love casts out your fear because it casts out your sin. The moment you place your trust in Christ you are forgiven, made righteous, and assured of eternal life.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Yet you don't have...because you don't ask God for it.' James 4:2 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The Bible is a book of prayers - and answers. Prayer isn’t about trying to persuade a reluctant God to act; it’s about aligning ourselves with Him and taking hold of His willingness to be involved in life’s situations - both big and small. Yet sometimes the thing that gets in the way is us. Here are the two ways in which we can hinder our own prayers.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(1) <em>Failure to pray</em>. The first problem is, whilst we spend a lot of time talking about prayer, we often fail to get down to the business of praying! Elizabeth George said, ‘Prayer... releases the energies of God,’ and until you learn to pray in faith and wait on God for the answer, you’ll get nowhere. We ‘<em>do not have because we do not ask...</em>’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(2) <em>Unconfessed sin</em>. ‘Your sins have hidden God’s face from you, so that He will not hear.’ (Isaiah 59:2 NIV) Your first prayer should always be wanting to make sure you and God are ok - clearing the air by cleansing your heart. If you’ve got sin you haven’t brought to Him and said ‘sorry’ for, then get on that, pronto. And fact is: you and I are dripping in sins we don’t even realise we’ve committed. Seeking His forgiveness for them is a big part of asking to be realigned with His heart. If you’re not aligned with God, your prayers won’t be either.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So, don’t delay. Move the hindrances out of the way. Let the first thing you ask for be forgiveness.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Th 1-3, Mt 4:1-11, Ps 90:7-17, Prov 1:5-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58058&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.' 1 Peter 3:7 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Prayer is not just about asking God to change things - it is about being changed and shaped by God in the process. Sometimes we ask God to change others yet often we are the ones with the greater need to be changed. Prayer is a very powerful weapon, yet it can be hindered by our motives and our actions. Here are two more things that can get in the way of our prayers. (Read yesterday for the <em>Previously in word4U2day</em> summary.)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(1) <em>Unresolved conflict</em>. The Bible says, ‘If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.’ (Romans 12:18 NIV) Honouring God’s instructions in life readies us for prayer, so we should address disagreements and seek to make amends. He knows, by the way, if you’ve been trying honestly and wholeheartedly, and the other person doesn’t budge. He won’t let that block your relationship with Him (but He’ll know if you try to use that as an excuse, yeah?)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(2) <em>Self-centred living</em>. When the Israelites complained God was not answering their prayers He told them, ‘Stop oppressing those who work for you and treat them fairly... share your food with the hungry... clothe those who are cold and don’t hide from those who need your help. If you do these things...the Lord will answer.’ (Isaiah 58:6-9 TLB) Failure to care can also affect your prayers. How are you treating others?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Ask God to reveal any ways in which you may not be honouring Him in your motives or your actions.</span></p>

Bryshon Nellum was shot in the legs in 2008, yet took home a silver medal as part of the USA men’s 4x400 relay and Manteo Mitchell kept running for 200 metres on a broken leg, rather than let his team, who went on to win a silver medal, down. They each had a dream, a vision of what they wanted to achieve and took action despite their circumstances to realise it.</span></p>

Barker said, ‘Vision with action can change the world.’ As Christians, we have all been called to ‘run the race’. We have been given a vision (John 3:16), pointers for action (Matthew 28:18-20), an example to follow (1 Corinthians 11:1) and a prize - eternity with God (1 John 5:13).</span></p>

But keep your vision before you at all times ‘that he may run who reads it.’ (Habakkuk 2:2 NKJ) Your Christian vision is the road map for your life. Write it down and read it regularly from the Bible so that you can join with Paul, saying: ‘I run straight toward the goal to win the prize that God’s heavenly call offers in Christ Jesus.’ (Philippians 3:14 GWT)</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 20:1-3, Deut 6:1-9, Mk 12:28-34, Rev 2:1-7<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58066&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

It is often seen as the most exciting part, where the runner’s adrenaline kicks in and the wind rushes past them in the final push towards the finish line. But the truth is that the real work of the race was done out in the slow jog covering the kilometres beforehand. It was during the slow plod that the runner’s stamina, training and commitment were tested.</span></p>

An illness, an issue in the family or an unexpected exam result can cause us to question our strength for the journey ahead, or even the worth of continuing. But the Bible says, ‘We can rejoice...when we run into problems and trials, for...they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation.’ (Romans 5:3-4 NLT) What a race was set before Jesus - His starting blocks a stable, and His finishing line a cross. Yet it was because ‘of the joy awaiting Him’ (Hebrews 12:2 NLT) that He endured the pain and punishment that bought us peace - and now we no longer face our race alone.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 5-7, Mt 5:1-12, Ps 10:12-18, Prov 1:17-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58109&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

There’s something in our nature that kicks out at the thought of taking responsibility, isn’t there? Shifting the ‘R’ word may help with your guilt, but it’s toxic rather than medicinal.</span></p>

In sentencing Jesus to die, he washed his hands in front of the crowd and said, ‘I am innocent of this man’s blood… It is your responsibility!’ Someone should have said, ‘Err, Mr Pilate? Hello?! You’re the boss, Pontius old buddy! Top dog, even! You can’t just blame the Jews!’ He was there to choose whether to crucify a criminal or an innocent man but he cast off any responsibility because he feared the consequences of the decision. Saving Jesus? Crucifying Him? Either way, he wanted out of the responsibility.</span></p>

The Bible says God holds you responsible for your decisions and actions: ‘He will judge everyone according to what they have done.’ (Romans 2:6 NIV) How do you deal with conflict and bad circumstances?

<introtext><![CDATA['...if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.' Matthew 6:15 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Blaming can become addictive. Once you get the cheap victory of feeling like the ‘innocent bystander’ (or worse, ‘the victim’), and palming off all that bad decision-making onto the fall-guy you’ve chosen, you can get a taste for this sort of twisted glory.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Ever found yourself secretly preferring a good moan rather than looking to solve the problem? It’s a first class ticket to losing friends, credibility, and your life-coping skills. It’s also pretty pathetic.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But there’s worse - blaming can completely get in the way of forgiveness. While you’re judging and resenting that person, there’s no room in your thinking for giving them grace. You might say, ‘That’s just the way I feel’ or ‘not my problem’ but you should know that way of thinking comes at a massive price. It <em>is </em>your problem: ‘...if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.’ (Matthew 6:15 NIV) Forgiving others is a condition God gives you on His forgiving you. That’s huge. No forgiving others = no forgiveness from God for <em>your</em> sins. Sort of puts the blame-game and its moaning into perspective, right?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Practical action time. Who haven’t you forgiven? Think of actual events, people around you every day. If you’re not over something that’s been done to you, it’s time to decide to forgive, with God’s help (and boy do we need that help!) If you’re really struggling with this, that’s ok, but do something about it: speak to a church leader, or a Christian counsellor.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 13:38-14:57, Mt 5:38-48, Ps 3, Prov 1:29-31<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

There’s no threat in the world that can get behind the shelter provided for you by your heavenly Father. He’s placed a thumping-great-big-sized wall of protection between you and anything that would try to take you out of His arms. Ever wondered why the great prophets and warriors of the Old Testament could walk into a terror-filled situation with uncanny confidence? It’s because so many of them had been pulled into the throne room of God and all but met Him face-to-face. When you’ve trembled before that Almighty King whose presence awes the angels, nothing on earth has quite the same fear factor. That’s not to say we’re supposed to be hiding in terror from God - quite the opposite. The immensity of His love for us should inspire reverence! Yet when you know He’s on your side, ‘fear of man’ doesn’t have quite the same ring any more... So now, get yourself into the Throne Room of God! Old Testament prophets had to be dragged, resisting all the way, into the Throne Room of God, but you come pre-installed, hidden in Christ who sits there with the Father. As a Christ-follower, you’re already an installation in Heaven!</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 15-17, Mt 6:1-8, Ps 46, Prov 1:32-33<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

He was his co-worker on the mission field, preaching and living out the Gospel. Paul wrote to him after he was put in prison for the second time and he knew he was about to die. His letter was all about persevering in God in spite of suffering. Penning letters from prison, essentially on ‘death row’ for preaching Jesus Christ... <em>There</em> was a man who had ‘a faith to live for / a faith to die for.’ Paul was hardcore for the Gospel and he felt really connected to Timothy because he had hardcore faith. Timothy shared a lot of the hard times with Paul when others had abandoned him. Paul said, ‘I was reminded of your sincere faith.’ Faith really shines out of you when you stick with God when times get tough.</span></p>

God could really surprise you. He could give you words that could really speak into their lives and, before you know it, you could be introducing them to Jesus! When you said ‘yes’ to God, you were saying ‘no’ to the old you too. Put on love with Christ, rather than what’s hot with the in-group! ‘Let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.

<p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>There’s nothing wrong with doing your best. The Bible says, ‘Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.’ (Colossians 3:23 NIV) Be like the disciplined runner: ‘Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.’ (1 Corinthians 9:24-25 NIV) Running the race well for God isn’t about you staying ahead of other people, it’s about letting God set the pace for you. That way He can reign and His Kingdom can advance. Check your motivations with God. Have you been looking to do your best or simply beat the rest?</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 23:26-25:55, Mt 6:25-34, Ps 74:1-11, Prov 2:6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58153&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you know these things...do them.' John 13:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Your decisions and actions are based on what you believe. If you look at some of the people in the Gospels, their actions reveal big faith: they sacrificed everything to get a bit of Jesus.</p>
<p>In Luke 17:12-14 NIV it says, 'As He was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met Him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, &quot;Jesus, Master, have pity on us!&quot; When He saw them, He said, &quot;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&quot;' According to Jewish law, you couldn't go the temple if you had leprosy. You were unclean, and the punishment was being stoned to death. Yet 'as they went, they were cleansed' (Luke 17:14 NIV) - when Jesus said 'go' they risked their lives. Because they believed, they were healed. A haemorrhaging woman, repulsive to society, made her way through the crowds just to make a grab at Jesus' cloak. She knew in her heart that was enough. Because she believed, she was healed.</p>
<p>You can yell 'Hallelujah!' and 'Amen!' and testify when you hear those stories in church. But do you show off God's glory <em>outside</em> of church by the way you live and treat people? Put your faith into action. 'You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last.' (John 15:16 NIV) These guys stepped out and Jesus gave them more than they'd dared hope for. What practical thing can you do, outside of a church building, to step out with Jesus?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Phil 1-4, Mt 7:13-23, Ps 79, Prov 2:9-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58163&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We will stand in Your presence...cry out to You...and You will hear us and save us.' 2 Chronicles 20:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>A young man asked his wise friend, 'Do you ever feel down?' 'Sure,' he responded. 'What do you do about it?' the young man enquired. 'I get up again. Being down isn't my problem - staying down is. I'm either up, or I'm getting up. I've learned not to park in between.' We all feel down from time to time, and scientists tell us there are two main causes: <em>fear</em> and <em>fatigue</em>.</p>
<p>Today, let's talk about . When Edomite armies marched against Israel's king, fear gripped him and his nation. Feeling powerless, they feared losing their God-given land and possessions. But the king turned to God and prayed: 'Whenever we are faced with any calamity...we can...stand in your presence... We can cry out to you... and you will hear us and rescue us.' (2 Chronicles 20:9 NLT) Don't let fear cause you to abandon your hope and your vision. Instead, stand in God's presence, cry out to Him, and watch Him rescue you. Throughout the Old Testament, God reminded Israel of His track record of goodness. He wanted them to remember it and take courage. So, remember Who's in control of your circumstances today. Stand in His presence, cry out to Him, and watch Him rescue you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Dan 1-2, Mt 7:24-29, Ps 81, Prov 2:11-15<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58164&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us not grow weary while doing good...' Galatians 6:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Now let's look at the other main cause of feeling down: fatigue. Plain and simple tiredness. Every time a new invention comes along - email, microwaves, mobile phones - people have predicted it would mean we'd all have to work less and could relax more. You know how this ends, right? We scurry around even faster than before trying to fit more stuff in to our already jammed weeks. Fail.</p>
<p>We forget that God designed us to need one work-free day a week for rest and spiritual renewal (Exodus 20:8-11). As a result, fatigue saps our creative energy, distorts our outlook, diminishes our joy, erodes our confidence, weakens our grace and patience reserves, makes us far more likely to lash out, and generally drains us spiritually. Elijah is a great example of this. Single-handedly he defeated the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). In answer to his prayer God sent fire from Heaven that consumed an altar and turned Israel back to God. It was a spectacular victory, yet on the heels of it he got so down he actually asked God to take his life. Now that's reaching an all-time low! So what did God do? Like any good doctor, He diagnosed the man's problem and prescribed three things: proper diet, help in the form of Elisha, and... rest!</p>
<p>Do you have a Sabbath? One day a week for nothing other than rest and refreshment? Start this week - and see if it makes a difference to the other six days.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Dan 3-4, Mt 8:1-9, Ps 84, Prov 2:16-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58165&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why should we sit here waiting to die?' 2 Kings 7:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Christians can get a bit of a reputation for being boring, or playing it too safe. It's no bad thing to apply wisdom to our everyday decisions (even when our mates don't necessarily understand it), but there <em>is</em> a place in the Christian life for taking certain risks...</p>
<p>Four lepers sat outside a city under siege. They weren't allowed into the city (they were lepers, after all), and they weren't likely to survive a stroll to the enemy camp. The surrounded city was starving, and these four guys worked out their odds of survival were slim and getting slimmer. Their choice: sit and die slowly, or stand up and go knock on the enemy's tent doors, and see if they've got a spare sanger or two. Off they went, only to discover the enemy camp was deserted. Read the story in 2 Kings 7. (It's a good twist, worth your time.) So what's the moral of the story? If things are looking grim, God can bring you a wilder delivery than you might ever dare hope for. However, you need to choose to walk in bold faith to see the fruit of it. Run it past God first (that means praying about it and checking the Bible) but sometimes, take a risk with Him and see how it pans out!</p>
<p>Pray for courage and boldness.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 20:7, Is 29:22-24, Mt 6:9, Phil 2:5-11<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58166&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Death and life are in the power of the tongue...' Proverbs 18:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'<em>Word</em>.' It's quite a useful...um...word. Microsoft have made a bit of a name for themselves with it, and even we at UCB have made use of it (check the title banner, hmm?) But not every 'word' is worth paying attention to. Whether it's culture or experiences, the media or politicians, we can find it difficult to accept and trust every 'word' as equal or as truth. Maybe you've been hurt by someone's word not matching their behaviour.</p>
<p>God uses '<em>The Word</em>' as a carefully chosen title for Jesus: He is God's message to us, He comes forth from the Father like a word from a mouth, and because He's from Father God, He's completely trustworthy. In fact, He is Absolute Truth Himself. (John 1:1 makes a brilliant reference to Gen 1:1 to tell us about Jesus... go compare!)</p>
<p>Our culture pushes a curious lie: that absolute truth doesn't exist. You'll hear sentences like: 'You can believe that, I'll believe this - we can both be right.' If 'this' and 'that' are different, the logic is just plain...wrong. For thousands of years though, God's Word (we call it 'the Bible') has given a trustworthy, logical rock to stand on. More than that, 'Blessed is the man...[whose] ...delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night... In all that he does, he prospers.' (Psalm 1:1-3 NRS)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Discipline your children...' Proverbs 29:17 NRS<br /><br /><p>If you're feeling a bit got at, it could be that God's taking you through a period of correction. But that's ok. Parents, teachers, pastors, difficult mates and even-more-difficult colleagues can all be used as part of God's cosmic plan to discipline you. You might roll your eyeballs when some of them turn round to you saying, 'It's for your own good,' but the reality is that it is. You may not want to hear this, but it's actually pretty impressive that God arranges those difficult times or people into your life for you to learn lessons that actually make you holier...</p>
<p>God knows though, yeah? Hebrews 12:11 NLT admits that, '<em>no discipline is enjoyable when it's happening - it's painful!</em>' The light at the end of the tunnel is the end product: you'll be closer to God, with a more mature relationship, and better equipped to deal with the dodgy stuff of the world. (A stronger <em>Up</em> and a better <em>Out</em>.) A warning: being disciplined does NOT mean being punished. God hasn't gone off you. If you <em>are</em> feeling that way, check that you're not being convicted of sin and get real with Him. However, once you've done that, stand tall securely in His forgiveness and love for you. When you know God isn't standing against you through your trials, you can know that He's standing <em>with</em> you. And, if that's the case (to paraphrase Romans 8:31), <em>bring it on</em>.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Dan 8-10, Mt 8:18-27, Ps 89:15-37, Prov 2:21-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58711&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

How are you doing about sharing your faith with your friends who don’t know Jesus? We all know the difference between planning to do things and actually doing them. Sometimes our plans to put things right with God get put off and off. If you know you’ve let things slip, choose today to be deliberate about sitting down with God and asking Him to show you the state of your heart.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Dan 11-12, Mt 8:28-34, Ps 89:38-52, Prov 3:1-2<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58712&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord...has given rest to His people...' 1 Kings 8:56 NIV<br /><br /><p>Can you think of a moment in your life when you knew everything was going to turn out all right? Like a big blanket of calm falling over your mind, emotions and soul. It comes often at the start of something: at the start of a relationship, at the start of the Christmas holidays, at the start of a good book... You feel like you can settle down and give yourself up to whatever life's got for you.</p>
<p>That '<em>whoosh</em>' of peace that comes with these moments is from God (when we come across any good feeling in its natural, designed-for habitat, it usually is!) And, actually, His plan is for us to get a regular dose of it. Weekly. When we 'Sabbath' (that is, take a Sunday or other day off for God), we stop, take account of how our week's gone, and make more-than-usual space to look at life and live in the day conscious of God's presence. On a Sabbath, you can hear and feel your Saviour's invitation afresh: 'Come to Me, all you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.' (Matthew 11:28 NLT) Then you settle down for the week ahead, and <em>feel ready </em>to give yourself over to whatever He has for you...</p>
<p>Whatever day you're free to work with (Sunday's good, mainly because it comes at the start of the week), sleep a good amount the night before and get up early. Have a quiet, leisurely breakfast with God, and enjoy His presence. Just see how much better a start to the week it is.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jas 1-2, Mt 9:1-13, Ps 91, Prov 3:3-4<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58713&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['This, then, is how you should pray...' Matthew 6:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever felt uneasy while praying? Praying can tap into all sorts of insecurities making you feel like you're on a first date with the Lord Almighty. Am I praying properly? Too long? Too short? Will He like what I say? Is it the right stuff but in the wrong order...?</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:5-8, Jesus straightened out prayer for some prayer-a-phobic disciples. Top priority was God's name, because God is holy. What 'holiness' means is a fairly big topic, but to summarise it here, you could read: 'Something that we recognise as separate to us, not 'of us' or anything we could do or make. Something that is either the perfection of God Himself, or carries the image or the feel of Him.' God wants you to realise who you're talking to, and He wants <em>you</em> to become holy (Whoa! Yes - <em>holy</em>.)</p>
<p>Secondly, it's about God's Kingdom. His plan, His way of doing things, His priorities, His rulership. These are good things. Things worth giving up <em>your</em> priority list for. Thirdly, desiring God's will to be done. He practised what He preached, even staring death in the eyes. (Check Luke 22:42.) Only after you recognise these things and bow to them is it right for you to put your requests in. Jesus was strict about not worrying about food and frocks (Matthew 6:28-33); He wants us looking in gratefulness to the most generous Provider (not the things He provides).</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jas 3-5, Mt 9:14-26, Ps 96, Prov 3:5-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58714&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...when the time arrives...' Hosea 13:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>'When God, <em>when</em>?' If you've ever asked God for anything, you've probably grumbled out the '<em>when</em>' question. Waiting can be hard. The career, the breakthrough, the bus... they all require waiting. How we act before we see an answer says lots about our levels of trust for God. Frustrated? Bored? Disappointed? These are indicators that you probably aren't fully giving the situation to Him.</p>
<p>It's ok to want things to be better. It's ok to question God about when He'll do that thing you want. But God wants us to grow in patience, too. That can mean actively waiting on God, even for good things He wants to give you.</p>
<p>Patience doesn't come naturally. It's a product of living in Jesus (look at Galatians 5:22). It's no mistake that patience is the first characteristic mentioned in Paul's famous '<em>love is</em>...' passage in 1 Corinthians 13. God is patient with you; choosing patience in your response to Him (and to others) is not always easy, granted, but is a great discipline to get yourself into. Patience is different from waiting - it's more than just tapping your fingers. It's trusting He has your best in mind and is not playing games with your life.</p>
<p>Trust can need you to be strong, though. There will be some things and times you just can't figure out. Ask God for peace about them. And watch you don't get yourself so tied up in knots you forget God's character. Finally, remember, '<em>When your faith is tested your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing</em>.' (James 1:3-4 NLT)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 1-2, Mt 9:27-38, Ps 100, Prov 3:7-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58715&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us...' 2 Corinthians 7:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>God longs to 'comfort you and strengthen you.' (2 Thessalonians 2:17 NLT) And judging by the average Monday morning Facebook newsfeed, a fair number of us long to be comforted and strengthened.</p>
<p>But it's much harder for Him to do that if you're not being real with Him. He knows that the state of your heart long-term is what's important, not just an easy fix of comfort. And actually, real happiness comes from the long-term work of your heart being properly at peace with God, others and yourself. If you know in your heart everything's not quite right between you and Him, that might mean a bit of repentance too. God longs to comfort you, but you have to want Him to: you have to want more than just a good feeling.</p>
<p>The spiritual and the everyday are deeply linked. If you haven't put a grudge to rights with a friend, family member - or enemy - God's not going to keep giving you spiritual highs. Nothing floats free and totally independent of God's reality. Are you feeling downcast and haven't sorted out a problem with a friend? Or haven't told God about that one thing you really should have? Get it sorted. And then, as today's verse says, He'll be there for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood Australia Day: Ex 20:8-11, Is 58:13-14, Lk 4:16, Heb 10:19-25<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58716&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others...' Ephesians 4:31 CEV<br /><br /><p>Snakes and spiders terrify a lot of people. Not a big surprise, is it? Not when you consider their habit for biting people with life-threatening poison and all... People can bite too. Not with their teeth (we hope) but definitely with their words. But we're not called to fear people. The Bible says, 'We can say with confidence, &quot;The Lord is my helper, so I will have no fear. What can mere people do to me?&quot;' (Hebrews 13:6 NLT) If you've had words spoken over you that hurt, bring them to your Dad in Heaven. If they go against what God says about you, reject them.</p>
<p>God says, 'Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others.' If God says <em>stop</em>, you can be sure He won't give you that command unless He'll also give you the grace to help you. Words can bite and, just like venom, get into our system. Then bitterness, rather than love for God and for others, can pump through our veins. Focus on who God's called you to be, so you can move forward in the opposite spirit. Take a contrary attitude to bitterness! Pray for the people who hurt you to be blessed instead and watch God flourish your life. Have peace that 'in all things God works for the good of those who love Him.' (Romans 8:28 NIV)</p>
<p>God cares about justice. Free yourself and let Him judge.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 3:1-4:33, Mt 10:1-10, Ps 104:1-23, Prov 3:9-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58717&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The disciples were in trouble far away from land.' Matthew 14:24 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jonah, James, John, Jeremiah, Jesus... Ok, so your name doesn't have to begin with a 'J' to be caught up in a storm - you might be in one right now. The thing about extreme weather is... it's <em>extreme</em>! Storms don't email you their schedule. They're brutal, relentless and can leave you a quivering wreck.</p>
<p>But there is a lifeline. When the waves of life smash you in the face, you can cling on to the words of Jeremiah: 'The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. &quot;The Lord is my portion,&quot; says my soul, &quot;therefore I will hope in Him.&quot;' (Lamentations 3:21-24 NRS)</p>
<p>Here are five key truths that can give you the breath you need: (1) There's no end to God's love for you. (2) His mercies keep coming; you just need to see them! (3) In fact, He's stacked up a load of 'new mercy' for you today! It comes in fresh each morning. (4) He's more committed to you than anyone ever could be. (5) The Lord God Himself is the One who meets your needs. God is sovereign and He's looking at your life from a much greater perspective than any satellite. Allow your current circumstances to build your trust in Him.</p>
<p>Take comfort from Jeremiah's words in Lamentations. Write them out and put them near where you sleep so they're close at hand when you feel most vulnerable.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 4:34-6:27, Mt 10:11-20, Ps 104:24-35, Prov 3:11-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58719&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is in store for me the crown...' 2 Timothy 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>What's the reason for untapped potential? Maybe part of the answer is attitude. Thinking you've made it before you've even started can be the beginning of the end. Your Christian life's no different. Over the next few days, we're going to look at becoming all that you're meant to be.</p>
<p>The first pitfall is <em>selfishness</em>. Yes, it's an obvious one - and yes, you'll have heard it before, but there's a reason why the middle letter of sin is 'I'. Stephen Kendrick said, 'Almost every sinful action ever committed can be traced back to a selfish motive. It is a trait we hate in other people but justify in ourselves.'</p>
<p>When you became a Christian, you were probably aware of your sin and selfishness. So you committed to living for God instead, right?</p>
<p>What changed? Did something slide? God hasn't changed His goal for you, that you can stand tall in Him and declare 'I do not live anymore - Christ lives in me.' (Galatians 2:20 NCV)</p>
<p>He's still calling you onwards...</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 7, Mt 10:21-31, Ps 107:1-9, Prov 3:13-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58105&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['That...day...God will reveal who His children really are.' Romans 8:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>At the gates of Heaven, once God has smiled His grace on all of His children, some will hear an extra, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' Others will look on, wondering what they could have become, if only they'd listened to that still small voice. Is that still small voice speaking to you today?</p>
<p>Getting your eyes fixed on Jesus is all well and good in theory, but actually doing it is costly. Paul got a fair bruising for his faithfulness to God's call. He was beaten almost to death eight times. He faced danger from both foe and friend. He lived through nakedness, sleeplessness, starvation and thirst (2 Corinthians 11:23-29). Did he get fed up? Yes. Did he then give up? No. 'I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake...' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NAS) Did he pray for a break? Of course. Three times he asked the Lord to take away his suffering. When God replied, 'My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT), Paul learned to 'take pleasure in...insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NLT), leaning on God for strength. Where did he find such joy? Through 'the infinite value of knowing Christ.'</p>
<p>Paul didn't have it easy, but he'd nailed what it meant to really put Jesus first. Once he'd got that, he accepted the tough stuff that came his way, even took pleasure in it, knowing that God was using it for <em>good</em>.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 8-10, Mt 10:32-42, Ps 107:10-16, Prov 3:19-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58063&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on to...receive the heavenly prize.' Philippians 3:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Play... Pause. Skip back. Play... Pause. Skip back... Do you find yourself dwelling on past hurts? Do the 'what if's' and 'maybes' never really leave you?</p>
<p>We're told to 'fight the good fight of faith.' (1 Timothy 6:12 NIV) That means that our faith sometimes needs willpower to get moving. You'll find yourself in a situation where you have to choose to trust that God will get you through and be true to His promises. You are in a battle, whether you realise it or not, and your spirit needs to be strong. So make sure you prepare yourself for the fear, criticism or pull of things around you that will try to shake your focus. (And the enemy has no better ammo than something you feel was a failure - he'll throw that one at you as much as he can. Pssst. God can blot <em>that </em>mistake out of your past, and give you the shield to defeat <em>that </em>every time - decide to give it to Jesus. He is faithful.)</p>
<p>If you're going to be all that God made you to be, clear direction is a must. Make Paul's words your warcry: 'I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God...is calling.' (Philippians 3:13-14 NLT)Here's your battleplan: print it out and put it someplace you'll see it often:</p>
<p>(1) Forget the past. (2) Looking forward to what lies ahead. (3) Press on to reach the end. (4) Receive the heavenly prize. (5) God... is calling!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 11-13, Mt 11:1-9, Ps 107:17-22, Prov 3:21-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58103&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The simple believes every word, but the prudent [wise] considers well his steps.' Proverbs 14:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Wise people take careful action, think in great detail about what they do before they do it, and make steady steps forward. They don’t jump blindly into any situation or crash through life, out of control. Does this sound<em> bor..rring</em>? Like a recipe for a seriously dull life? No. Wise people listen for God’s sure words, instead of following every whim of the world.<em> </em></span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Is this for or against God’s ways? </span></em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Jesus always talked about motivations and the heart of the matter, not just the action. For wise people, it’s not just about the consequences of their actions. It’s also about whether the whole situation might be stained with sin from start to finish, or blessed with the breath of God. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Sometimes living day–to–day in God’s ways is a mix of practised instinct with a learned knowledge of the way He is and the way He works (look for this in the Bible...)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>And sometimes God talks straight to you. This happened to Joshua when he had to lead Israel across a river to the Promised Land. God had promised that when the feet of the priests carrying the ark stepped into the river it would roll back. Here, God’s ‘sure words’ went directly against the rules of nature. But to reach his destiny Joshua had to step into the water. Faith dared where reason faltered. This wasn’t about jumping blindly—it was about a sure, God–spoken adventure. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But his sons did not walk in his ways...' 1 Samuel 8:3 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Cain and Abel are a good example of how a godly household <em>doesn’t</em> operate. Ever felt like your older/younger brother/sister (delete as appropriate... the words, that is, not the siblings) was always the favourite? Could never ever do anything wrong? Cain felt like that, and he took it badly. He made an offering to God, but his brother Abel outdid him. Rather than talking it over with God, Cain let his anger rule him, and before you know it, he actually did hit “delete” on his brother’s life. (Full story in Genesis 4:1–13).</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Is this another ‘Now play nice, Christians...’ lesson? Not quite. Yes, family life will sometimes go your way, sometimes it won’t. Think: debates over who gets to use the bathroom; who has to wash the dog; petty little things. Sometimes you need to rise above your own reaction when you look at your brother/sister (in the home, or the church) and all you feel is jealousy or hatred.</span></p>
<p>But here’s the meat of this message: it’s in the ‘petty‘ friction of a closely knit group of people that godly character is built. It’s in those untimely opportunities to sacrifice that Christ appears beside us, and beckons us to pick up our own cross alongside Him. Cain could have learnt about the importance of ‘dying’ to his selfish feelings and caught a glimpse of that heavenly, new life of sacrifice—and been a better person for it. But he didn’t. Bad attitudes fester. Is there something you need to make right with your family before any more damage is done? This may not mean big, grand gestures—it could be as simple as choosing something your parents do for you (like making the tea), and doing it for them today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 16-18, Matt 11:20-30, Ps 107:33-43, Pro 3:27-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58327&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Adopting kids means paperwork, meetings, social worker visits—all sorts of complications, not to mention the possibility of heartbreak along the way. But the parent never gives up, because the joy of being a parent outweighs the frustrations of the process.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Whenever you live your life separate from God (whether it’s for years or even just for a few moments when you turn your back on Him) it brought Him much pain. But He signed your adoption papers using Christ’s blood. Today’s verse says: ‘His Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children.’ We’ve come into God’s family—a royal family in which we are joint–heirs with Jesus to God’s Kingdom. God loves us enough to adopt us! Your baby–steps in awkward, clumsy prayers were priceless for Him. The first time you made that decision to try to put God over your own desires was a beautiful moment. With God’s adoption, you really are in the family home. (Yes, there may be bickering with your brothers and sisters, but you’re a family that looks out for one another.) God adopts you because He wants to love and raise you in the family.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Do you have that assurance of ‘God’s Spirit joined with yours’? It’s not a feeling you can just conjure up.

<introtext><![CDATA['The poles... are not to be removed.' Exodus 25:15 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>In our efforts to make God seem accessible, some of us have created our own ‘my mate God’ theology: God the personal trainer with extra genie powers. Yes, Jesus has made it possible for us to be friends with God. But our friendship should grow out of profound awe.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2 Samuel 6 is an unsettling story for anyone who thinks of God as ‘my mate down the road’. David was bringing the Ark of the Covenant* back home to Jerusalem. The Ark was the most sacred symbol of God’s actual holy presence, so nobody was supposed to touch it directly. As the Ark was paraded, it began to slide off the cart carrying it. A well–meaning bystander went to stop it from falling—a nice motive. Except this wasn’t just any old church–box, this was God’s presence on earth at the time. It was not to be touched. It wasn’t supposed to be carried on a cart, either. The man who reached out to grab it hadn’t understood all this, and it cost him his life. (<em>Woah!</em>)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The story reminds us that God isn’t ‘my little buddy’. His presence is holy; this is <em>God</em>.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So where’s His presence now? <em>‘Don’t you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?’</em> (1 Corinthians 6:19 NLT) If we are going to carry His presence, we have to do it His way. So enough of the ‘My mate the genie God’ theology. Grasp the seriousness of being a friend of God. If you usually pray with a shopping list, why not ditch it today? Instead ask Him how He wants you to respect His holiness. </span></p>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The Field Marshall laid out the battleplan carefully and strategically. Each soldier was talked through their particular role in the combat. Each was directed to a special position. Finally came the masterstroke: leading each battalion, an <em>unarmed priest</em> would walk into the crossfire. Yep, unarmed. No armour, no weapon. He’d drag a wooden box in front of the entire army and leave it alone on the ground. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>This would ensure the battle would be won.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Doesn’t sound a winning strategy, does it? Imagine trying it in a war–torn country today. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Yet this unlikely course of action was the principal tactic of war again and again in the Bible. Priests would go before the armies and lay the Ark of the Covenant out the front. The message being sent to the opposing army: <em>God, the Warrior King and Creator of all things, has got our back. And if you dare stand against Him, it’s Him you’re taking on, not just us</em>...</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The same is true for you today: God is stronger than your most serious trouble. Trust the presence of God which you carry, and which goes before you to protect you. This is about well–placed confidence in the God shown right throughout the Bible. God may not take the whole battle away from you but He promises, when you’re upset, when you’re criticised, or running at 50% capacity, or just ‘getting by‘ with life, He will always have your back. So talk to Him about standing between you and your ‘enemies’.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 25-26, Matt 12:22-37, Ps 120, Pro 3:33-35<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58330&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... So He is first in everything.' Colossians 1:18 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>This week, we’ve seen how the Ark of the Covenant symbolised God’s presence, His strength, and His holy friendship. All of this circles around the key teaching of our faith: <em>always put God first.</em></span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Deuteronomy 10:12–13 NLT puts it like this: ‘What does the Lord God require of you? He requires only that you fear the Lord your God, and live in a way that pleases Him, and love Him and serve Him with all your heart and soul. And you must always obey the Lord’s commands’. In short, if you’ve got a war on your hands—put God in front of you. If you’ve got a choice to make—put God in front of you. Facing confusion— put God in front of you! As G.K. Chesterton noted, it was through looking after the Ark that the people of God found out how to look after themselves. It was through the purity rules for His Temple that they learnt cleanliness. It was through keeping God’s Sabbath that they themselves learnt how to rest.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The Ark of the Covenant reminds us that a full life is the afterglow of putting God first: ‘...do not depend on your own understanding. Seek His will in all you do, and He will show you which path to take.’ (Proverbs 3:5–6 NLT) Or in Jesus’ words, ‘seek first His [God’s] kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things [that you worry about] will be given to you as well.’ (Matthew 6:33 NIV)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The Ark of the Covenant is a topic that could broaden your understanding of God.

Matthew 6:27 NLT <br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>What worries you right now? If you’re a student, mounting debts and shrinking job markets might be getting you down. If you’re post–exams–not–gone–to–plan / post–school / post–job–I–just–left, you might have just as much reason to dread your prospects.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But God has worked in greater recessions than today. Try a forty year recession in a desert—didn’t God provide from the sky? Yes, He did. Try a starvation recession—didn’t God sustain a widow for months using herlast bit of oil and flour? Yes, He did. Didn’t God feed over 5,000 people using just a boy’s lunch? Yes. He did.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>There’s no recession in Heaven. Your prospects may look crushing, the job market slim, but now is the time to recall that famous David quote: ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need.’ (Psalm 23:1 NLT). This instance of your life is barely a centimetre in God’s unravelling plan for you. Watch it as it rolls out—see if He doesn’t look after you. </span></p>

Ephesians 4:23 NLT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Cleaning your room or your place: it would be nice, just once, to have everything in its right place, not just stuffed under your bed or in one big pile on your desk. But here’s some good news: tidying up your physical space is not as important as some other things (sorry, reader’s mum). The bad news? Cleaning up your mind is what’s more important and it takes a lot more effort than your room. Paul writes, ‘throw off your… former way of life… let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.’ (Ephesians 4:22–23 NLT) We need to give our ‘stuff’ to God.</span></p>
<p>What kind of stuff? Well, as we hope you know by now, certain things clog your relationship with God. Trying to please everybody, feeling insecure, needing everybody to like you, jumping to wrong conclusions, always needing to be ‘right’, recording all the times you messed up, wanting to know how it all turns out, needing to have all the answers... sound familiar? They’re a result of not being honest with God (and not seeing who He is, over your situation). If you need some work, you should probably let Him know.</p>
<p>Being honest with yourself can be difficult, especially if you’re not so comfortable with opening up. But it’s extremely useful to move on with God and clean up. So take a few minutes to enter a list of things you know that are impure in you onto your phone or a piece of paper. Today ask God to give you an opportunity that will allow Him to clean up your mess and renew your attitudes about these very things.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 20:13, Gen 4:8-16, Pro 18:21, Matt 5:21-22 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58336&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>It’s a strange thing: Jesus opened the doors of Heaven wide for His disciples, showed them the free wonders and mysteries of God, the wealth of really knowing Him. They seemed to get it. Until they got a taste for glory, and not in a good way. In Mark 10, the brothers James and John started to like the whole getting–honoured–by–others business, and put in a request for a couple of shiny thrones.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>‘No’, said Jesus, ‘not so among you.’ It might be the way of the world to climb an increasingly golden ladder, but with Jesus’ people, the glitter and the power only comes through the cross. With Him we are to treat other people as more worth than ourselves. Want to do something amazing in Jesus’ eyes? Give the old dear from church help with moving her old fridge. Want to bring miracles and wonders into your circle of influence? Take time to chat with the kid everyone thinks is weird. The greatest leader ever didn’t come to earth to live in a palace or win all the glory; He lived out Galatians 5:13 NLT: ‘Don’t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature [looking inward to you and you only]. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love.’ </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>This isn’t just Jesus ‘teaching us a lesson’ before we get those crowns for being heirs of the King. This is the way the world works best—so God is showing us what works the very best for us. Look out for those who could do with kindness from you today.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 32:25-33:56, Matt 13:10-23, Ps 134, Pro 4:5-13<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58720&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given...' Matthew 25:29 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>For those who think attitude and work ethic don’t have anything to do with their faith, Jesus said something that ought to make us all sit up and take notice: ‘To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.’ How does working as if God is on the job with you affect what you do—or don’t do? Procrastination. Lazy days that turn into weeks. And yes, time on Facebook (where the best minds of the generation spend hours clicking <em>refresh</em>, starved for updates...) These things all make a difference, for good or bad. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Well, your salvation doesn’t hinge on what you do or don’t do. A day spent YouTube–browsing won’t rewrite your eternal destiny, but make a habit of it and you genuinely might be risking God’s best for your life right here on earth. There’s a whole world out there, and He has a heart and a plan for it (which may just involve you). If you slack off in the small things, God isn’t going to trust you with big things. Now, He won’t give you a task that’s bigger than what you’re capable of. But if you work as if God is on the job with you, faithful in using the gifts He’s given you, you’ll go to places only He can take you. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Have you got an accountability partner? Ask a truthful and well–meaning friend to give an honest assessment of you. What do they think needs to change in your life? What do they think you’re good at.

<introtext><![CDATA['I have done the Lord's work humbly...' Acts 20:19 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The authority of God</span></em><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>.

Clich</span><span style=&quot;mso-bidi-language: AR-YE;&quot; lang=&quot;AR-YE&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot;>é</span><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>? Good. We need to <em>live </em>by it. Think about it—knowing that your faith in Christ has God’s seal of approval means that you can step out in faith with some confidence. The persecuted church? They know it. In fact, anything (as small as you can imagine) that you do to share God’s love to others is ‘working’ for Him. <em>You </em>are a necessary, valued, authentic part of His Kingdom.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Sure, we know that those who work for the church in an obvious way (pastors, leaders &amp; interns, missionaries) are ‘working for God’. But actually, most of those people would probably tell you that ‘working for God’ is more about those special moments of interaction with someone. Moments where you can see God at work in the little things that you do with/for them, than about the ‘9 to 5’ bulk of the ‘job’.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>This means that alongside seeing God congratulating the church planters, the teachers and the administrators with ‘Well done good and faithful servant,’ (and He will), He will also say, ‘Well done good and faithful single parent,’ ‘Well done good and faithful house cleaner,’ ‘Well done good and faithful friend to that lonely person’, ‘Well done good and faithful saw–someone–in–need–and–stepped–out–for–them–as–if–they–were–Jesus.’ Yes, basically that. Your greatest work for God may begin in a situation you find yourself in every day.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So today, look out for people who need something. Stop and take a moment to look at them as if they are Jesus in disguise. <em>Now </em>decide what you will do for them.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jonah 1-4, Matt 13:36-46, Ps 141, Pro 4:18-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58722&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Proverbs 24:16 GWT<br /><br /><p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Paganini is widely considered to be the greatest violinist of all time. A story goes that once, playing a concerto, he snapped a string. The audience was devastated as this meant a waste of their evening. Not to be defeated though, Paganini played on, using the three remaining strings. And such was his determination he ended up violently breaking a second string. The audience accepted that, alas, the night’s showcase was done with. But Paganini played on, and just as the piece of music was reaching a climax—the violin was reduced to one sole string. Not to be crushed, the maestro played the final bars with one string, before taking a bow and uttering the famous words, ‘Paganini... and one string!’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Everybody gets knocked down in life. You’ll have days when your strings are snapping. The question is, will you play on? Not in a grim, gritting your teeth and getting on with it way—if you’re a Christian, you can know that God has forgiven your every trip and fall—so the important thing now is simply that you get back up, brush off, and know that your Heavenly Father looks you straight in the eyes without embarrassment. The key to character is not how often you fail but how you respond to it. Do you re–centre your life around God, or cover your face in pride?</span></p>

For what? He’d just denied his Lord Jesus three times. He’d only gone and proved to himself that, deep down, he was what he’d always suspected—a little bit shaky.

Even when Peter was hiding out while Jesus died, God still had His eye on him for glorious things. Know what? God’s promises are true for you. And until you see that proved in your own situation, stick close to Him. He knows what’s best for you.</span></p>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>How <em>not</em> to use the Bible: (1) Take a verse at random and ignore the rest of the chapter. For example, take a running jump from a twelve storey block of flats whilst explaining to the paramedics, ‘It’s ok! My vertebrae will be just fine. I can do <em>all</em> things through Christ who strengthens me!’ If you’d bother to read the whole of Philippians 4, for example, you would see that Paul is talking about his ability to get on with the job despite trials and tribulations—not claiming to be an early incarnation of Superman.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(2) Make up your own ‘The–interpretation–I–think–suits–me–best–right–now’ translation: For example, Psalm 37 quite clearly says God will give you the desires of your heart. <em>Well God, if you could transfer a wad of cash into my current account, that’d be great!</em> Much as you may like this translation, the Psalm is actually about bringing <em>your</em> desires in line with <em>His</em>, not the other way around. (And if you stop to think about it, you probably wouldn’t have it any other way, right?...) How about a passion for justice, a streak of creativity, a holy anger, a forgiving spirit? God’s promises usually end with blessing others, not just yourself. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood.' 2 Timothy 3:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you have ever felt like your parents don’t understand what it was like to be you, well, on some levels, you’re probably right. Never before has a generation been as ‘connected’ as we are. How much of our lives, our friendships, our romances and our disagreements go onto the worlds of Facebook and Twitter? This completely changes how we understand ‘relationships’, compared to the way our parents did when they were our age.</p>
<p>But that’s only the beginning—the stuff that can find its way onto our screens has changed drastically too. Years ago, if someone wanted to look at explicit pictures, it meant walking to a special shop, or else having an awkward conversation at the newsagent and paying for it. Today, as you know, Google can take you straight there (and all too easily).</p>
<p>Are we giving you argument–ammo for your next fall–out with an ‘intrusive’ parent? No. Despite all of the changes to how we see the world, we have more in common with our elders than we sometimes think. Despite their own distractions, they worked out how to do life. So, in a world of temptations and trying times, tapping into some well–earned wisdom is probably worth consideration.</p>
<p>So what now? Ever struggled with the ‘duty’ of ‘respecting your elders’? This week, make time to spend quality time with someone older. Get to know how they see God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 20:14, Pro 6:23-35, Matt 5:27-30, 1 Cor 6:9-20 <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58727&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

But, unfortunately, some of us don’t get the whole package. Maybe the word ‘Dad’ isn’t a good one for any number of reasons; past hurts and rejection can be really difficult to deal with. Or, if the word ‘Dad’ isn’t a word that you’ve ever really had to use, then we’ve prayed for you as we wrote this. We think the transforming power of Father God is worth knowing about, whatever your own experience of ‘Dad’ might be.</p>
<p>It’s not absolutely clear what kind of experience Jesus had of His earthly Dad. Joseph was a committed guy, to his family and to God, but there isn’t too much to read about him. One thing we do know is that Jesus clearly had no issues seeing God as His Dad—He got up early and stayed out late just to spend as much time with Him as He could.</p>
<p>It is impossible for us to get a handle on the massive picture of God’s Fatherhood, but we can all discover what TRUE fatherhood looks like. His Word (the Bible) tells us these things about it: He’ll never stop being available for you, supporting you, providing for your every need, sending His angels to protect you, pulling you through any difficulty, and giving His life just to be with you.</p>
<p>So what now? Today, make time with your Heavenly Father. Share your heart and dreams with the best Dad you could ever hope for; He’s always listening.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 5-8, Matt 14:13-21, Ps 149, Pro 4:25-27<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58729&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.' Ephesians 6:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible’s pretty clear on the way God wants families to work: ‘Honour your father and mother.’ (Exodus 20:12 NLT) We know that in pretty much every area of life, the ideal doesn’t match God’s standards—and parenting is one of those areas. Parenting is hard work; it means living for someone else, serious self–sacrifice, and constantly stepping out of your comfort zone. Today’s verse doesn’t make it any easier—God doesn’t just want children to survive, but to know true life in Him. That’s a big ask of already hard–working parents.</p>
<p>Parents can be really valuable in teaching life–lessons, yet our dads and mums can fall far short of perfection; as does everyone, by the way. So today, we’re talking about being big. If they do something wrong and you do something to get back at them, does that make you any better? Grace—‘unmerited favour’—is what God has given to you so you can pass it on. Sometimes the best way to ‘honour’ your parents is to forgive them, to give them grace for their mistakes, even if they may not genuinely deserve it. (But if we’re honest with ourselves, we’ve probably messed up big–time at some point too). Grace is the picture of God’s forgiveness of us.</p>
<p>For some, taking this step of grace means just talking to your parents, clearing the air, and forgiving them. For others, it may mean the start of a longer deeper journey—we’d encourage you to get trusted support as you start it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 9:1-11:16, Matt 14:22-36, Ps 5, Pro 5:1-2<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58730&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled...' Matthew 26:56 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>‘Why do you seek the living among the dead?’ The angels asked the disciples at Jesus’ tomb. A lot of people ask the same today: ‘Can’t you just leave Jesus as a “good teacher” story? Isn’t the resurrection better off as a nice metaphor, written by confused first century peasants trying to make sense out of a seemingly meaningless death?’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But reading the story itself, in Matthew 28, the ‘confused peasants’ don’t seem very confused. They know exactly what they’re saying. If it was all a metaphor, why does Matthew mention officials spreading rumours of Jesus’ stolen body (Matthew 28:13)? Why include the story of His return at all, why not a <em>spiritual</em> resurrection? They were talking about an actual tomb, an actual body. And an actual Saviour God embodied in Jesus (told by prophets)—why else would Philippians 2 include an early hymn about an <em>earthy, grounded</em>, <em>human</em> Jesus being the same as God Himself, if it was all just a fairy tale?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Our leader, Jesus, is <em>alive now</em>, and <em>is</em> King. He defeated our own sin by actually dying and now He’s actually here again. Christianity doesn’t rest on floaty ‘nice’ advice, or even Jesus’ own sayings, but on the real action of God in this life. The absolute best way to investigate for yourself or to answer your mates’ questions about Christianity being true is to have a good look at the Gospels’ stories about Jesus. Pick one (Mark is probably the easiest to start with) and read it front–to–back in one go. </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:17-13:25, Matt 15:1-9, Ps 28, Pro 5:3-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58731&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Help us for the glory of Your name...' Psalm 79:9 NLT<br /><br /><p><em>‘I was morbidly obese, but thanks to BellyBusters I’m now a delicious size 10!’ … ‘I smoked three packs a day, but now I’ve stubbed it out’ … ‘Drinking almost killed me, but I found the bottle to stop!’</em></p>
<p>What causes someone to finally break an addiction or habit that’s destroying their life? According to corporations all you need is a little willpower…and, of course, their trademarked product. But is it as easy as all that?</p>
<p>For those of us trying to kick a secret sin or a destructive habit—pornography, eating–disorders or self–harming are biggies in this area—our own best attempts can barely dent the addiction. And the last thing we need when we’re already low is another guilt smackdown. But hey you—yes! <em>you!—</em>are not the only one who reacts this way. And you’re not a lost cause.</p>
<p>Getting help from a wise Christian mentor you can trust is essential—someone who will point you to God and help you to know His power is the only one that can free you from the power of addiction. God’s very real and immense love for you is key to helping you becoming an overcomer.<strong><em> </em></strong>If today’s reading has touched a nerve, pluck up the courage to get a bit of help. And do it quickly. God loves you too much to leave you stuck in that place.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58733&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.' Matthew 4:3 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>God will allow you to face temptation. Why? For the simple reason that: the evil you’re being tempted by exists. And in order to take part in this world as a child of God, you need to have encountered it and chosen God over it. It’s a process that makes you more faithful to God, stronger to resist distractions, and more effective at pointing other people to Him in similar situations later down the line. In the spiritual war that you’ve been born–again into, you <em>need </em>to know your enemy and, with Jesus’ help, to practice choosing God over the enemy.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>And… <em>Jesus went through it</em>. This response is not as clichéd as it may sound. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>‘…Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.’ (Matthew 4:1 NKJ) Jesus had gone to spend serious, dedicated time fasting and focusing on His Father. So when Satan offers Him a ‘helpful,’ ‘easy’ fix that would turn His back on seeking His Father’s plan, you can see that it could have been an attraction. But Jesus doesn’t take the easy way. He takes God’s way, saying, ‘No! The Scriptures say, “People do not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes from the mouth of God.”‘ (Matthew 4:4 NLT). When you resist temptation, you trade it in for something better. The fact that you face it means you come out with riches of goodness that you can’t get anywhere else. Today, make a conscious effort to recognise when you’re tempted to stray from God. Refuse to give in at those times, and look hard at what God is improving in your life as you stay firm.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 3-5, Matt 15:21-28, Ps 33:13-22, Pro 5:15-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58756&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then the devil...had him stand on the highest point of the temple.' Matthew 4:5 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>In the second of Jesus’ temptations, Satan takes Him to the highest place in the region and tells Him to throw Himself down. Satan suggests to Jesus that God will just click His fingers and order ‘His angels to protect You.’ (Matthew 4:6 NLT) Here Satan, a true legalist, quotes Psalm 91, a poem of faith in God. He turns what God wants to be a simple matter of trust into a twisted test.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Surprise! <em>Jesus knows better</em>. His Father isn’t there to be toyed with. So He answers, ‘The Scriptures also say, “You must not test the Lord your God.’ (Matthew 4:7 NLT) Jesus isn’t denying God <em>could</em> or even <em>would </em>save Him, but He knows God’s bigger picture.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>This story reminds us we need to look at who God is (and what He is promising us) from the top—knowing that God is King with a higher purpose for us, not our personal superhero who is instantly available to get us out of tight corners. First and foremost He is the Lord our God, who exists above His creation. In a beautiful, baffling way, He decides to come down to the level of allowing us to choose whether or not to trust Him with even the smallest areas of our lives. It would be a mistake, which would play right into Satan’s claws, for us to take one promise out of context and forget (or never learn) all the other Scriptures about who God is. The answer to this devilish threat is to know more of your Bible. Flip to Psalm 91 and read the original Scripture that Satan misquoted. What <em>overall</em> picture of God does the Psalm give us? </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 6-7, Matt 15:29-39, Ps 36, Pro 5:21-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58757&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Satan shows Jesus everything that would one day be His: ‘all the kingdoms of the world and their glory’ (Matthew 4:8 NLT). Then he offers Him a way to get them all <em>now</em>, <em>without </em>going through everything He would have to face in His life: mockery, misunderstanding and, of course, the agony of the cross. It’s the biggest short–cut of all time. Jesus knew that if He took Satan’s ‘cheat’ option over the Cross, humanity would lose any chance of being reunited with God. Dodging His own pain would have been disaster for you and me. He <em>is </em>Lord, and all kingdoms and glory <em>are </em>His, but the Trinity’s plan was His sacrifice for us. Through that sacrifice, Jesus was glorified not only as our God, but as our Saviour.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>If we live to take things for ourselves only—whether it’s power, sex, another human being, or sometimes even too much of good experiences and things like food—those things will turn to ash in our mouths. Comfort is never comfort, really, when it’s grasped at the expense of something else important. And if you’re going after selfish comfort, and going against God’s good plans, you’ll end up causing pain.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Back in the wilderness, Jesus was steps ahead of this. ‘“Get out of here, Satan,” Jesus told him.’ (Matthew 4:10 NLT) Can you say the same when you’re offered attractive, short–cut temptations?</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...have your sandals on and your walking stick in your hand...' Exodus 12:11 NCV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Good or bad, change comes to us in lots of different ways. If we handle change, out of fear or selfishness, we’re likely to change our minds if we sense the situation’s not going our way. This stunts commitments and relationships. But, when God’s properly in charge, change means only one thing. Growth.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Is there something you’re shying away from doing? Maybe it’s a mission trip, going to church, striking out with a friendship group, or looking for a different workplace/uni/college/future ‘whatever’. It could be anything. The point is that when God prompts you to change something, there is no time for mucking around. Fear will hold you back from some of your best opportunities to grow.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So, what to do? Well, maybe it’s time to solemnly raise a three–fingered ‘Scout’s Honour’ salute and ‘Be Prepared’. God instructed His people to have their ‘sandals and walking sticks’ at the ready. Just in case you weren’t aware, God’s Spirit <em>will</em> move unexpectedly! He might even ask you to take that terrifying step for Him… today.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>And what about unwanted change that’s not from God? If everything’s spiralling out of your control, then it’s time to look up and pray. God does not change. His opinion about you, His perfect plans and His promise of eternal life do not change!<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span>So meet up with an older, wiser Christian, and ask how they responded to changes that God brought about for them. You might be able to learn what you need for the situation you’re tackling today!</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 8-9, Matt 16:1-12, Ps 40:1-8, Pro 6:1-5<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58759&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Patience isn’t the most appealing of topics. We aren’t used to waiting around. Everyday things like social media and texting are set up for you to have immediate control. But if we aren’t careful, we could forget the importance of something vital—<em>waiting.</em> Waiting… in the supermarket queue, for the bus, for sex within marriage, for God Himself—will always be a challenge if we’re expecting everything to happen ‘when I want it to’.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You see, often God requires us to make time for Him, just to wait for Him to move in us. His timing is better than ours. Not convinced? Try it. Spending time in prayer and Bible reading might bring about some very important changes: (1) <em>You might toughen up.</em> Have you ever felt like you’re a bit too weak, soft or shy for what God’s got in store? The Psalmist knew what the real deal was—waiting for God is like being charged up: ‘Wait on the Lord… and He shall strengthen your heart…’ (2) <em>God will pull you through.</em> If you feel trapped, abandoned, left out, or under pressure, you’re not alone. ‘I…waited for the Lord… He lifted me out of the pit…’ says Psalm 40:1–2. ‘Going through’ a situation and taking it head–on is helpful, but only with God’s direction and power. Otherwise, we’re all prone to making things worse for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>When you’re queuing, maybe for a bus or your lunch, let other people in first—it’s a simple exercise that reminds you to slow your pace of life (and you’ll probably bless a random stranger too </span><span style=&quot;font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>:) </span><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>).</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 10-11, Matt 16:13-20, Ps 40:9-17, Pro 6:6-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58760&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I...am the Lord, and besides Me there is no Saviour.' Isaiah 43:11 NKJ <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>We are a reflection of God. But we more often than not get that truth twisted. We’re prone to make God fit our image of what He should look like. An extreme example: The ancient Greeks had a truckload of their own gods; just buckets of them. They encouraged worship through prostitution and permitted human sacrifice, direct from the imaginations of whoever invented the perversion. You might think: ‘Glad we don’t live like that!’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But have you ever kept God ‘in His place’ until you need Him? No? What about that time you never sought His will in that relationship/job/university that didn’t work out? God is so much higher than we are. The problem with making God our ‘last–minute–lifesaving–superhero’ is He has His own plans, which may not coincide with your plans. He is His own Person.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>And besides, out there in the world, a balanced representation of who God truly is can be hard to find. You may have been introduced to the ‘Jesus is my Boyfriend’ God on your Facebook timeline, with some cutesy Bible verse pictures. Isn’t He so nice? Or perhaps you’ve seen the like–this–page–or–go–to–hell Jesus? Isn’t He threatening? We must get to grips with who God <em>really</em> is. How can we do that? Well, there’s a whole book that is very specific about His purpose, character and promises and purposes, inspired by Him. You’ve got it… the Bible! How can we get the whole picture? Open that Book. SoulFood is a good place to start.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 12-13, Matt 16:21-28, Ps 53, Pro 6:9-11<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58761&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom...' Proverbs 9:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>When Jesus was on earth, His attitudes and behaviour were so different to society’s and individual’s expectations. They called Him a revolutionary, but He paid taxes. They came to see His miracles, but He refused to entertain them. In a male–dominated society, He recruited females. He didn’t do things the way He was expected to. They couldn’t control Him.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Is that still the way He works? Yes, those characteristics will still come into play in His relationship with us. In fact, we reckon that if you’re a Christian you’ve probably been given a spiritual ‘poke’ to change your mind/ways/habits. It’s hard to confidently hand things over to God when He prompts you, especially when they’re bad habits that you probably feel comfortable with. But here’s the truth: if God’s going to change you (which is hopefully what you want!), then you can’t be in control of it.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Yet, avoiding that constant heart–battle is fairly simple—<em>accept that He is God</em>. If God is God, and you are a human, why<em> should</em> you hang on to unhelpful habits? They need to be yielded to God. This is commonly known as ‘fearing’ Him— in other words, accepting that He knows better and is totally in control of any situation, in the best possible way.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 14-15, Matt 17:1-9, Ps 58, Pro 6:12-15<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58762&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>This ‘fear of God’ talk. Pretty serious stuff, isn’t it? Think about it. Jesus is actually the same God who saved the people of Israel but left Pharaoh’s armies at the bottom of the Red Sea. The same God who has all power over the universe. The same God who keeps us breathing. So, should we be <em>scared </em>of Jesus? Of course not. But to know that He is far and above us is a good starting point. In Proverbs 1:7 we learn that ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge’.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The disciples were shown this. One day, Jesus and Peter, James and John were up a high mountain. Right in front of the disciples’ eyes, Jesus was joined by Moses and Elijah, great Godly heroes from the past. Elijah had disappeared about eight hundred years previously and Moses had died over a thousand years back. Peter, despite being completely stunned, suggested erecting three tabernacles to honour each one. Immediately a bright light appeared and God proclaimed, ‘This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased. Listen to Him!’ The disciples fell to the ground and were afraid. They were reminded that although Moses and Elijah were great men of God, no one is equal to Jesus.<span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;>  </span></span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>It’s a good idea to grasp how high–up the scale Jesus is. He is actually God. He is bigger than life itself but, amazingly, He is also interested in our lives.Try this<strong><em> </em></strong>humbleness exercise: look up at the stars tonight… now count them. Just kidding. You can’t. And God flung them all out!

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>So, as we’ve gathered, God is pretty massive. He threw the stars into space. Breathed life into your lungs. Healed that friend you prayed for. When you start to get to know God and His power, like, <em>really</em> get your head around it, it’s totally mind–boggling. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The Bible refers to Him as ‘light’. Darkness cannot touch Him. So… does that mean that we’ll be so dazzled by His blinding presence we can’t even get close? We might get so caught up thinking about His power that we miss the point. So, how should we approach God? Not cowering in a corner, in a special ‘holy’ place, or on a prayer mat. But Jesus taught us to pray like this—‘Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name…’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>The word ‘hallowed’ basically means ‘holy’, which in context is: ‘be held in the highest honour’ or ‘awesome’. We can pray to Him in our own hearts. What? Yes—you know the verse ‘your body is a temple’ (1 Corinthians 6:19 ESV)? Well, your heart literally is a mobile throne for God. Jesus did all the necessities to remove any blockade, difficulty (or temple curtain) that stops us accessing God. Awesome. And because of that, He most likely really cares about you (like a <em>lot</em> a lot). You can approach the Highest, in confidence, in any given moment. Are there places or times you just don’t usually consider praying to God? Maybe in the supermarket, or in a friend’s house while you’re watching TV, or during a conversation with a teacher/lecturer/boss? His throne (His power) is mobile and you can invite it into any or all places.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 18:16-20:43, Matt 17:18-27, Ps 66:1-12, Pro 6:20-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58967&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>How long have you been following God for? A week? Month? Ten years? Cool. Now, think about this: how much have you developed? It might be a good idea to take a minute to write down two or three things that God has changed in you. In fact, it is a very good idea. Jot them down now.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Done? Now then, we’d like to put a theory forward: the longer you serve God, the bigger <em>your</em> understanding of Him–in–your–life definitely should be. For instance, when you first became a Christian, you might have struggled with a swearing habit. But what about two years in? If that habit has been kicked, good on you! Or, are you still struggling with some of the same old stuff, turning a blind–eye to God’s promptings to change? </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Remember the God we’ve learned about in the last couple of days? The tremendous, all–powerful God? He cares enough to accept you just the way you are but He also cares enough not to leave you just the way you are. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about allowing God to take charge (His role) and putting effort in (your role) to give up those habits so that you can reach better things. Hard work on your character now will pay off later. No kidding! When you begin to really give everything over to God, you’ll appreciate this ‘life–to–the–full’ business even more. Think about what God has done to bring you through for the better. Tell someone about how God has changed your life. Or go to <strong><em>word4U2day</em></strong>’s Facebook page (www.facebook.com/word4U2day) and comment on today’s reading online.

<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>At the end of His life Jesus was able to look back and know He was successful in bringing glory to the Father—He had finished well.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Do we spend time thinking about what ‘success’ is going to look like in our lives? To most people, success means certain things—career, relationship, kids, money—all going to plan. The problem is that life rarely goes according to <em>your</em> plan, and if you happen to pray, ‘Your will not mine’, it’s certain to go down a path quite different to the one you expect. To Jesus, success meant the path His Father laid out. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Following His path means living for something far greater than the world’s scoring system—more glory for Him and more joy for you.

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man who perseveres...' James 1:12 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Perseverance. A real toughie. Where do you start? Well, we’ve all been through hard times. It’s not easy to keep on keeping on, doing the right thing, when it would be easier to give up. Generally, the world we live in doesn’t like ‘sticking it out’. Relationships, education, jobs, friendships—these can all last for as long as we can be bothered. It’s pretty obvious the attention–span of society is getting shorter.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>We’ve all felt our commitment wavering, probably even in relationship with God (we can all remember that time He didn’t seem to answer our prayers). But if you always base your decisions on what seems <em>right at the time</em> or on what makes <em>you</em> feel good, then commitment isn’t ever going to seem very attractive when things aren’t going your way. The purpose of your relationship with God is to simply put Him first, regardless. (The prospect of dying on a cross was not attractive to Jesus, but He persevered to the very end.)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You see, maybe, just maybe, God knows more than we do. If you’re following Him in order to make a difference to this world (and not just in yourself), then what He does might not always make sense to you. But having the perspective that He’s got it under control AND it’ll always work out for your ultimate good is surely worth carrying on through difficult times. Community is vital to Christian life (see John 17:20–26) but especially in tough times. If you’re not going to church or meeting regularly with other Christians, it’s time to make a change.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 1-4, Matt 18:10-20, Ps 70, Pro 6:26-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58970&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You are the salt of the earth...' Matthew 5:13 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Positivity isn’t very funny. Not much in the world of entertainment comedy gets laughs from being relentlessly cheerful. Our ‘cool’ humour often borders on sarcastic, with negativity breeding negativity. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>But sarcasm is easy—if you want to be cynical, our fallen world is your oyster. Being grounded <em>and</em> cheerful isn’t. But it’s definitely worth it. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>What’s your attitude to life? Do your conversations and jokes build people up or feed an attitude of moaning and groaning? Are negative people really the sort you want to be around? Think: how much better is it to be around that rare person who makes you feel better about life? They’re so positive and they leave you walking away feeling just the same about life. It’s catchy.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Jesus said, ‘You are the light of the world.’ (Matthew 5:14 NIV) That means you should be different. Has it occurred to you that the positive person you like to be around could be you? Being refreshingly different is always good—people welcome it. There’s so much more to life than our scornful, wise–cracking culture has told us—but only when it starts and ends in Jesus. So if you find you’re tending to feel more cynical than usual, have a look at your daily habits—who are you mixing with; is the stuff you’re watching on TV and the internet doing you any good?</span></p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-ultimate-source-of-wisdom]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The wisdom that is from above is...' James 3:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>As you go through life you discover there are many ways to gain wisdom, such as: (1) Writing down and reflecting on what you've learned through experience. (2) Gleaning from the collective knowledge of others. '<em>By pride comes nothing but strife, but with the well-advised is wisdom</em>.' (Proverbs 13:10 NKJ) (3) Thinking outside the box. Statements like, 'This is the way we do things around here' warrant scrutiny when they're used to defend ways that no longer work. (4) Not rushing to closure. Growth is always a work-in-progress. Creativity is untidy and unnerving. The ability to stay focused and faith-filled in the midst of change is a hallmark of maturity.</p>
<p>But the ultimate source of wisdom is God! A young executive told his secretary he'd an important meeting and didn't want to be interrupted. But his boss needed to see him and walked in. When he found the young executive on his knees praying, he withdrew quietly and asked the secretary, 'Is this usual?' 'Yes,' she replied, 'he does it every morning.' 'No wonder I come to him for advice!' said his boss. If you need wisdom, talk to God: '<em>For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding</em>.' (Proverbs 2:6 NKJ) '<em>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally...</em>' (James 1:5 NKJ) '<em>The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</em>' (James 3:17 NKJ) '<em>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you...</em>' (Psalm 32:8 NKJ)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 19:1-23:20, Luke 13:1-17, Ps 119:49-56, Pr 21:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56371&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now get up and stand on your feet...' Acts 26:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Saul the Christian-killer became Paul the apostle - who saw that u-turn coming? No one, of course! That is what makes his transformation story so powerful (after the Christians got over their suspicions). It was an 'only God...' kind of change. Paul told his own story of what he was like: '<em>I...was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth... I put many of the Lord's people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them... I even hunted them down in foreign cities.</em>' (Acts 26:911 NIV) Only God could have taken a man whose life was so far gone, and turn him into the kind of evangelist that tries to persuade a king to meet Jesus: '<em>I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may became what I am.</em>' (Acts 26:29 NIV)</p>
<p>No one saw Saul's conversion coming except Jesus. He knew that the ideal man to kindle the flame of the Gospel across Europe was the very same as the one who had been trying to stamp it out. All it took was a radical encounter with Him. Ridiculous - but that's what happens when an individual really meets Jesus.</p>
<p>So often we lack Heaven's perspective on our situations. We see problems. God sees the other side of the coin. Bring to God your most challenging problem and ask Him to show you the potential lurking behind it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 23:21-26:19, Luke 13:18-35, Ps 119:57-64, Pr 21:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56372&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['People look at the outside of a person, but the Lord looks at the heart.' 1 Samuel 16:7 NCV<br /><br /><p>The eyes of Heaven don't see people or situations the way we do. 'What am I doing this for?' is a good question to ask yourself often; especially when you're praying! Sometimes we can seem to be doing something good and right but the reason behind what we're doing is all wrong. You might look good making your dad a cuppa or buying him his favourite chocolate bar. However if you're doing this is because you've just received your mobile phone bill and want him to pay for it, then your reason for being kind is all wrong. In 1 Samuel 16:7 NLT, the Bible says: '<em>People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart</em>.' You might be able to fool people that you are doing things because you are such a lovely person, but you can't fool God; He looks right through you and sees the reasons behind your actions.</p>
<p>Always check your reason for praying is a good one, not a selfish one. Why are you praying for this person or situation? Is it just to make your life easier? God wants our reason for doing things to be because we love Him and because we love people. Being selfish, revengeful or manipulative will get you nowhere with God. In fact He says if we ask Him for good stuff but our motives are wrong, then forget it. We just won't get it! So, why are you doing that?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 26:20-29:30, Luke 14:1-14, Ps 119:65-72, Pr 21:10-13<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56373&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We...are being transformed...' 2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Saul's transformation into Paul wasn't all that smooth. He cut himself off from the wealth and privileges of his former life, faced opposition and confusion from his new brothers and sisters in the Lord. But transformation isn't an easy process - just ask the caterpillar.</p>
<p>Some caterpillars wrap themselves in a cocoon; others zip their skins apart to reveal a pupa underneath. Whether inside the cocoon or the hard shell of the pupa, the caterpillar is trapped. It's unable to leave the chrysalis it's made to keep itself safe. Shortly the caterpillar itself starts to dissolve into a gooey, slimy mess. But in this mess, change occurs. Eventually a butterfly will fight its way out of the chrysalis - in a miracle of transformation. If your life is a mess - if you feel stuck in a gooey, slimy trap - it may be that God is in the process of miraculously transforming your life so that you take flight, like a butterfly.</p>
<p>We might not see clearly what's going on in our lives. To us, it just feels like we're stuck in the dark and we can't get out of the trap we've made for ourselves. But God does see clearly what will come in your future - so trust that He's creating miracles out of your mess and thank Him for the hope He gives to all of us We may not be able to get ourselves out of the mess, but He can.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 1-4, Luke 14:15-24, Ps 119:73-80, Pr 21:14-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56374&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... If you would believe you would see the glory of God.' John 11:40 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, you'll notice three important principles:</p>
<p>(1)<em> Mary and Martha had a close relationship with Jesus before the crisis. </em>When Jesus came to town, He stayed at their home and ate at their table. They already had a solid relationship with Him, and were givers, not takers. You can't refuse to give God a minute of your time, a fraction of your energy or a cent of your money and then when a crisis comes, say, 'God, where are you?'</p>
<p>(2)<em> Having a relationship with Jesus doesn</em><em>'</em><em>t mean you won</em><em>'</em><em>t ever have a crisis. </em>But it does mean that you can go to Him with confidence when it does.</p>
<p>(3) <em>When you bring Jesus into the crisis, He will change it. </em>Lazarus was already dead and buried by the time Jesus got there. But Jesus specialises in hope for the hopeless... '<em>Put your hope in the Lord - now and always!</em>' (Psalm 131:3 NLT)</p>
<p>Perhaps you've convinced yourself that a dream you had is dead and buried? Put your hope in the Lord! Now and always! You have resurrection power at your prayer's disposal. Welcome Jesus into the crisis.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 22-24, Luke 20:27-40, Ps 27, Pr 23:16-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56403&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Great persecution broke out...and all...were scattered...' Acts 8:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes God needs to take drastic measures to get us moving. After the first church in history was filled with the Holy Spirit, things were going great. Empowered, the church was confident and growing. At this point they could have comfortably carried on doing what they'd been doing up until then in Jerusalem '<em>...They continued to meet together in the temple courts... praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people.</em>' (Acts 2:4647 NIV) It seems that they all-too-easily lost sight of the big mission they'd been given (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>But the plan God had in mind was too important to allow them to stay in their comfort zone. So He gave them a wake-up call: '<em>Great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and... those who had been scattered preached the Word wherever they went.</em>' (Acts 8:1-4 NIV) Though it surely felt painful at the time, the spread of the Good News depended on it.</p>
<p>When God has a mission for you, He will do whatever it takes to get you moving. Before He will let you miss out on His mission for you, He will permit trouble to uproot you. So start moving, so that God can start blessing. Ask the Holy Spirit to point out any areas where God might be moving you out of your comfort zone and into what He wants for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 4:4-26, John 7:37-41, Ex 17:1-7, Is 35: 1-7<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56375&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But we all...are changed...by the Spirit of the Lord.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>Trying to force other people to change is never a good idea. Jesus knows how prone we are to try to change other people, and puts the question to us: '<em>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</em>' (Matthew 7:3 NIV)</p>
<p>Using our own tactics to get people to change - applying pressure or manipulation - is usually pointless. Give them breathing space. People need the freedom to be loved as they are. That doesn't mean they don't need or want to change. But nobody appreciates being given the message, even subtly, that they must change in order to be loved and accepted. So, it's about giving people room to change. We're more likely to change for those who are willing to accept us with our shortcomings, than for those who demand we live by their rules.</p>
<p>Prayer is the greatest agent for change, not pressure. If we truly love people we'll pray for them and allow God to work on them His way, on His schedule, and for His glory. For change to be lasting, it must come from the inside out. And only the Spirit of God can bring that kind of change.</p>
<p>So if there's someone in your life who would appreciate a bit less pressure and a bit more grace from you, begin praying for them today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 5-7, Luke 14:25-35, Ps 119:81-88, Pr 21:17-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56377&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Who are you...?' John 1:22 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Having a clear idea what God wants you to do with your life is a priceless gift, for two big reasons.</p>
<p>First, it means you can devote yourself to it. If you're not very good at other things, you don't have to worry. Apparently Paul wasn't a particularly great speaker: 'I came to you...timid and trembling...my message and my preaching were very plain.' (1 Corinthians 2:34 NLT) But what Paul lacked as a speaker, he more than made up for as a writer. Something so powerful was released through Paul's writings that lives are still being changed today.</p>
<p>And secondly, it frees you from worrying about what other people think. When he was asked, 'Who are you?' John the Baptist replied, 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord.' (John 1:23 NKJ) But after following John for a while, his disciples left him to follow someone else - Jesus! And John could be cool with that, because he knew he had been specially called to be a curtain-raiser for Christ. He wasn't the main act.</p>
<p>Discovering your calling is one of the most exciting, empowering things you can do in life: <em>don't worry if it's taking a while</em>. And if you're not sure yet what God has called you to be, then it's time to take some steps towards finding out. So get started by asking God to show you - and go from there! Then, once you've discovered it, give yourself over fully to God's plans for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 8-11, Luke 15:1-10, Ps 119:89-96, Pr 21:20-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56378&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He faced all of the same testings we do.' Hebrews 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Yep, it's true - Jesus gets you. Why? Because God not only made human beings, He became one of them in order to draw us back to Himself. He lived on the same terra firma, breathed the same oxygen, basked in the same sunlight, drank the same water. It's mindbending! It should almost sound wrong to us! The Creator knew what it was like being a child, went through the same bodily changes growing up, learned a trade. He had to learn how to interact with people - His parents, His siblings, His peers, His teachers, those in authority...</p>
<p>Jesus understands what you are going through today because He has been where you are. His family even thought He'd lost His mind. The Bible says He 'understands our weaknesses, for He faced all of the same testings we do... So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.' (Hebrews 4:1516 NLT)</p>
<p>True love has endured and understands all things. That means, if you're facing family problems, He understands (e.g. Mark 3:21). If you're feeling overwhelmed today, He understands (e.g. Mark 6:31). If you're feeling rejected, He understands (e.g. John 1:11). Jesus gets you, and He'd love for you to talk to Him about it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 12-15, Luke 15:11-32, Ps 119:97-104, Pr 21:24-27<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56379&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He faced all of the same testings we do.' Hebrews 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Do you get disappointed by people? Jesus understands, because those He loved and counted on let Him down too. Judas, His treasurer, sold Him out and then sealed the deal with a kiss. Even in His darkest hour, Gethsemane, His closest disciples - Peter, James and John - couldn't stay awake and pray with Him for an hour (Matthew 26:40).</p>
<p>Ever get overwhelmed by all the demands people lay on you? Jesus understands. 'A vast crowd brought to Him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn't speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and He healed them all.' (Matthew 15:30 NLT)</p>
<p>Ever get tired out from the basic demands of life? Jesus understands. '...Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noontime.' (John 4:6 NLT)</p>
<p>Have you been falsely accused? Jesus understands. They accused Him of being '... a glutton and a drunk...' (Matthew 11:19 GWT) Up until the time of His death they were still trying '...to find something false...so they could kill Him.' (Matthew 26:59 NCV)</p>
<p>True love has endured and understands all things. Yes, Jesus was flesh and blood; human like us, in every experience. Jesus - <em>God!</em> - really truly gets you!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 16-18, Luke 16:1-18, Ps 119:105-112, Pr 21:28-31<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56380&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give all your worries...to God, for He cares about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Evangelist George Müller said, 'The beginning of anxiety is the end of faith, and the beginning of true faith is the end of anxiety.' It can be the worst, most paralysing feeling in the world. Ever get like that? Where you just want to yell and thrash about, but the anxiety (over whatever issue, person, or circumstance) keeps you in place, scared to move.</p>
<p>Of all the things that worry you in the past or the present, statistically only about 10% will ever eventuate. Most of your worries will never happen! But if you're stuck in that horrible place of paralysis today, read these words of God: '<em>Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are Mine</em>.' (Isaiah 43:1 NIV) Put your own name in it, and remind yourself of what God has already said to His children. See what it's like to put today's fears into the context of a Father who has always had your needs in mind.</p>
<p>Life is too much for any of us to handle alone. So if you feel like you're being pulled apart in a hundred different directions, read up on the promises of God. Take your fears to Him and see if they don't shrivel and die: '<em>...And God's peace, which is far beyond human understanding, will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus.</em>' (Philippians 4:7 GNT)</p>
<p>Fear thrives in the darkness. Shine light on it. Put your fears into words, then remind yourself of God's promises.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 19-21, Luke 16:19-31, Ps 119:113-120, Pr 22:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56382&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, &quot;Increase our faith.&quot;' Luke 17:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Like a smart salesperson offering a really enticing deal, doubt can knock at the door of our minds looking so charming and innocent that we can easily find ourselves welcoming it in. So we need to keep a careful watch on the entry to our hearts:</p>
<p><em>Doubt fills a vacuum - </em>do you have an empty space where there are very few reminders of God's goodness and His gifts in your life? So we need to hang pictures on the walls, reminding us of where we've been and how God has been faithful to us. <em>Doubt often calls when there</em><em>'</em><em>s no one else at home - </em>or when you've filled the house with others who enjoy his company. Make sure you spend enough time hanging out with others who know God and are able to help you see what He's up to in your life. <em>Doubt calls at dinnertime - </em>just when we're most hungry for something to fill us up. The Bible says, '<em>...faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.</em>' (Romans 10:17 NLT) Regular feasting on God's Word is the best way to ensure that we don't fall vulnerable to doubt. It's good to explore questions about faith and seek answers to build us up. But doubt, that nags and tugs away at a heart given totally over to Jesus, is not to be welcomed. So, move from doubt to faith, by eliminating unscriptural words from your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 22-24, Luke 17:1-10, Ps 119:121-128, Pr 22:4-7<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56383&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Mark...is profitable to me for the ministry.' 2 Timothy 4:11 KJV<br /><br /><p>Friendships - some last the course of time, some slowly drift apart after a while, and some break up in bitter arguments. The first two are fine and a part of most people's life experience. The last might be experienced by many people too, but it's not how God wants things to go.</p>
<p>See Paul (the disciple and writer of a big chunk of the New Testament) and Mark (the apostle and writer of...go on, guess...) were both big guys in the Church, but fairly unhappy<em> </em>friends. Things first fell apart when Mark backed out of an overseas missions trip. Paul didn't like this - so much so, that he refused to let Mark accompany them on another trip to Cyprus. It got so bad it led to bickering between Paul and one of his best friends - the apostle Barnabas. People started to pick sides. Things were beginning to spiral out of control, and they ended up going their separate ways.</p>
<p>And yet, years later, Paul had an attitude reversal. He famously commended Mark, saying, '<em>He is profitable to me for the ministry.</em>' Mark wasn't written off in history as a loser for his missed opportunity - he went on to write part of the world's bestselling book: the Gospel with his name on it. Paul and Mark counted their disagreement as just some water under the bridge - nothing compared to serving Christ together. Do you need an attitude reversal over somebody? God hasn't given up on them, so why would you? Pray that God will show you how He views the 'Mark' in your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 10:1-18, Rev 7:13-17, Ps 23, Luke 15:1-7<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56384&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him.' 2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP<br /><br /><p>Here's a thought that should blow any Christian's mind: God loves and accepts you as much on your worst day as He does on your best day.</p>
<p>It's not based on the state your life's in at any given time. It's based on the cross. How? Well, think of the cross like a trading post. There God took every wrongdoing you'd ever be doing (past, present and future) and laid it on Jesus. And the moment you place your trust in Christ and come into union with Him, God only sees Christ's goodness and godliness in you. From that point on, He sees you just one way - wrapped up in that bundle of righteousness, as if you were Christ Himself.</p>
<p>In God's eyes, you got an A+. Yes, you made the team. You got the part. You don't need to do anything more to earn His approval. Jesus says, '<em>If you love Me, you will keep My commandments</em>.' (John 14:15 ESV) That's not talking about blind obedience or acting from an insecure fear of being rejected: it's a description of what happens to us when we love Jesus - we <em>want</em> to honour Him by following His commandments!</p>
<p>If you haven't already placed your trust in Christ, have a serious think about it! Can you turn away from how you're living now and put your life in the hands of the Creator of the universe? Ask yourself: can you turn it all over to Him? If you can, it's time to look inside the back cover and pray the prayer there.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 25-28, Luke 17:11-19, Ps 119:129-136, Pr 22:8-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56386&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him.' 2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP<br /><br /><p>The world tells us that our value is in what we do. But in God, we are loved simply by 'being'. That changes everything. 'But God must care about what I <em>do,</em>' you might reply. And you're right, He does! He wants you to be a good and whole person, holy like Him (1 Peter 1:15) and even now He's helping you get there. Your wrong behaviours won't be changed until you realise you are loved by God totally apart from anything you do. Put your self-worth in that, and you'll start to live out of real joy and contentment.</p>
<p>Jesus understands your personality, your struggles and even the faulty foundation upon which you might have based your self-worth before you met Him. He not only gets you, He cares about you. When you enter into that transforming friendship with Him, He peels away your pain, unveils just how valuable God thinks you are, and releases good gifts to you. Bit by bit, He restores everything the world might have stolen from you. And while all this is going on, you are positioned securely 'in Christ', where you'll remain always, forever at peace with God. If anyone you know is struggling with self-worth, remind them that God has created them to be a human <em>being</em>, not a human <em>doing.</em></p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 29-31, Luke 17:20-37, Ps 119:137-144, Pr 22:11-13<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56387&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I, Tertius, the one writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings.' Romans 16:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>So you'd like to be a good role model? You want people to notice you're different from the rest? Think you're the one to lead the way? Contrary to popular myth, leadership isn't about who can shout the most or get the job done most quickly; leadership is only properly done if you treat people like people. Like Paul. We know little about Paul's 'management style' but we do know that he wasn't about pushing others down so he could stay at the top.</p>
<p>A letter to the Roman church gives us an idea of how he wasn't afraid to give others a chance. He had a guy called Tertius on team (we know this because he's the one who wrote down Paul's thoughts in his letters to the Romans when, late in his life, Paul had gone partly blind.) Timothy, Paul's protégé, is often mentioned, not as a fellow colleague or dogsbody, but as a dear friend. And then there's Gaius, known as '[Paul's] host and...host to the whole Church.' (Romans 16:23 NLT) Paul lifted up everyone around him in order that the Church could be strengthened. Do you want to lead the way? Lesson one, then, is to think of others as much as you think of yourself. Surround yourself with people whose talents complement yours and build them up. It's the team approach that yields results. Paul used it. So did Jesus. So should you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 32-34, Luke 18:1-17, Ps 119:145-160, Pr 22:14-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56388&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me...' Psalm 139:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>Our culture loves to see people fail. Think of all the headlines that revel in gossip about the fall of a pop star or footballer. The problem is that all this stinks of double-standards - of course politicians fail, and of course Hollywood's elite crash and burn.</p>
<p>It's human to fall short. The true test is how you pick up the pieces. Look at King David: following his knockdown bout with Goliath, the people elevated him to superholy celebrity status, only to see him knocked down following an affair with a married woman. To David's credit, he didn't just brush the pieces under the carpet, he faced his mess honestly, head-on. He collected his experience in a poem: '<em>Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me along the path of everlasting life</em>.' (Psalm 139:23-24 NLT) If we want to be a role model to others, we must pray those words. We must be brave enough to allow God to show us our mess. It's never nice feeling vulnerable, but be brave today. God isn't interested in making you feel bad, He just wants to clean you up and get you on the right track. So ask Him to point out anything that's out of line or anything that offends Him that you need to delete from your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chr 35-36, 2 Jn, Luke 18:18-30, Ps 119:161-168, Pr 22:17-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56389&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out.' Proverbs 18:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Most of the jokes in classic comedies come from one person misunderstanding another. <em>Laurel &amp; Hardy</em>, the <em>Two Ronnies</em>, even most cartoon plots have comic communication failures as the basis of the whole story. (A small boy was looking at a plaque at the front of a church. The minister explained to him that it was a memorial to all the brave men and women who had died in the service. The boy was silent a moment. 'Which service was that?' he asked. 'The nine o'clock or the ten thirty?')</p>
<p>When we're under pressure we sometimes fail to hear what's being communicated. But if we take our eyes off our own concerns, God can help us to grasp what other people are going through. The Bible talks of the 'gift of discernment.' It's like God gives you extra-special sensitivity for a situation or circumstance or person, where you can cut through to the heart of the matter easier because God gives you discernment. Sometimes it's as simple as just shutting up and listening to what a person is really saying; sometimes it's about God giving you a particular thought that opens up conversation and cuts to the chase. The key is to concentrate on God in every situation (even when that means taking timeout), and then concentrating on building the other person up, not elevating yourself. So ask the Holy Spirit for the gift of discernment in your life. Then pray for a chance to use it in building up another person.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 3 John, Jude, Luke 18:31-43, Ps 119:169-176, Pr 22:20-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56390&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Listen...and I will give you some advice...' Exodus 18:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Hypothetical scenario: You decide to put on an outreach event. But then the whole thing escalates. Now there are a thousand and one jobs to do. What do you do? Three options: (A) <em>Get on with them yourself</em>. It was your idea to put the event on. It is your responsibility to get the jobs done. (B) <em>Surround yourself with a team.</em> Get a group of people together and carve up what needs to be done. (C) <em>Scale the event down.</em> You don't want to bite off more than you can chew.</p>
<p>Those who answered A will likely end up sticking their fist through a wall. Those who answered C are (probably) going to be disappointed with their event. But those who answered B are modelling a Biblical principle. Jesus surrounded himself with a close team of twelve. Each one was chosen carefully, and almost all of them were ready to give up everything for Him. That group made a difference one person could not have. Moses learned it the hard way: 'Moses' father-in-law replied, &quot;What you are doing is not good. You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone... Select capable men from all the people...and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens... That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. If you do this...you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.&quot;' (Exodus 18:1724 NIV) Good role models follow this example.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 1-4, Luke 19:1-10, Ps 84, Pr 22:24-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56391&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>To obey or not to obey, that is the question... right? Does God really just want us as our parents' minions? Sounds more like slavery than childhood! As important as taking the bins out is, there's got to be more to the fifth commandment than cold-hearted drudgery. Is God just testing us until we're old enough to have some proper fun? Of course not!</p>
<p>One of God's main roles is as a Father. It's reflected within the relationships of the Trinity: Father, Spirit and Son. The family unit is really where God wants His Church to start and end. Is this still important even if we're old enough to have left home? Yes! Jesus, the Son of God was also the Son of Man: He came to earth and was born into an earthly family. Luke 2:51 shows how He submitted to both. He honoured His heavenly Father in everything He did, but was every bit obedient to His earthly parents as well: '...<em>He was obedient to them</em>.' Following Christ's example, we should honour our parents the same way we'd honour God. That means a little thing called submitting. Tomorrow we'll look at what that means.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Father's Day  -  Phil 2:5-11, Rev 19:11-16, Acts 3:1-16, Matt 1:18-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56392&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>'<em>The human heart is the most deceitful of all things, and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?</em>' (Jeremiah 17:9 NLT) No one knows this more than parents. In the toddler stage, children develop a taste for saying 'no'. So is honouring your parents simply about reversing the curse and saying 'yes' to everything they say? It's more than that. Washing up when you're asked is good, but God's also looking at your inner attitude. That includes comebacks like, 'I'll do it after I've finished my Facebook update!' It's not honouring.</p>
<p>Jesus told the parable of two sons who were asked to do a job by their Father (see Matthew 21:28-32). The first son snarled, 'I will not,' but later changed his mind. The second respectfully said, 'I will go,' but never did! It's obvious which son did what his parent asked. But Jesus was directing it at those who appeared righteous. Just because you seem to do as they ask doesn't mean it's wholly pleasing to God. Attitude matters.</p>
<p>Sin is disobeying the divine authority of God. In the home, He's given your parents authority over you. That doesn't mean they're always right. If they do as He asks, they'll help you grow and provide protection for you. So resisting them can mean you're resisting Him... God's looking both for active obedience coupled with a top attitude. The difference between childlike and childish is important, no matter what your age. Are there any adjustments you need to make?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 5:1-8:29, Luke 19:11-27, Ps 103:1-12, Pr 22:27-29<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56394&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.' Joshua 24:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Over the next few days we'll be looking at how we can grow in wisdom, and the value of our parents and guardians in helping us out. But first, '<em>The beginning of wisdom is this: get wisdom!</em>' (Proverbs 4:7 ESV) If you want wisdom, really go for it! Get serious about it! Proverbs 2 tells us that wisdom is guaranteed to us as a gift. It's ours. <em>But</em> only if we're serious about getting it. Are you?</p>
<p>What is wisdom? And why is it worth giving it a shot? Well, for one thing, it's not just 'being smart' or having intelligence. The Christian idea of 'wisdom' is something else altogether, and it's not something you can get from learning. It's mysterious - a gift from Heaven placed in your heart. It 'anoints' your ordinary human perception and gives it a divine boost. Suddenly you see how everything around you fits into God's great bigger picture. What before was 'just another day, just another person, just another church service' is suddenly filled with meaning. Getting wisdom is like eating fruit from a tree of life - you're filled with new insight, and transformed by the renewing of your mind. It's the bread from Heaven that gives life. It's the way of living in the future Kingdom of God, today! So, if you want wisdom, go for it! Proverbs 9: 56 ESV tells us what 'wisdom' has to say to us: 'Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 8:30-10:43, Luke 19:28-40, Ps 103:13-22, Pr 23:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56396&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man reaps what he sows.' Galatians 6:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Wisdom is not just the 'godly glasses' that we pop on every now and again to view the world differently. Wisdom is a serious change of mindset - no, even deeper, it's a change of heart and soul that lines us up with Heaven. It's walking 'in the way of insight.' (Proverbs 9:6 ESV)</p>
<p>It's a spiritual attitude. But it shows itself in our real lives in the choices we make. The consequences we get are the result of our choices. So, if we want to grow in wisdom, how can we look out for it?</p>
<p>Look at your parents. Maybe even ask them about how the choices (positive and negative) they've made have shaped their lives. All of us need the helping hand of a wiser, older person to point out what should have been obvious all along. Your parents could - and should - be an excellent place to start.</p>
<p>But if you've been let down by absent or abusive parents, then that's no reason to feel you should lack wisdom. God's plans for you include a future and a hope and, despite your start in life, He wants you to become the wisest parent or friend you possibly can.</p>
<p>Earthly wisdom includes learning from others' successes and mistakes. If you can, spend time with your parents to ask them honestly about their lives. Maybe it will shed light on things that are happening for you and also give you deep wisdom for situations you'll face in the future.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 11-13, Luke 19:41-48, Ps 111, Pr 23:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56397&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Your thoughts...are the source of true life.' Proverbs 4:23 CEV<br /><br /><p>'Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.' (Proverbs 4:23 ESV) If you've grown up in a genuinely Christian home, you might occasionally look back and wonder if you've had a 'sheltered' upbringing. It might seem you've missed out on lots of exciting parts of culture and life. Maybe you find it hard to engage with certain sorts of people.</p>
<p>If that's the case, think about what your parents were actually trying to do. They've set you on a clear course in the journey of life. Others may have already steered themselves straight into the rocks, following the wrong currents and tides. Still others have meandered about in no particular direction. But, even if it sometimes felt boring, you've left the harbour of home safe and secure, and it's still the morning for you. Life waits for you, fresh, new and full of unspoilt opportunity God is by your side, as He has been from the start. That's the gift good parenting has given you.</p>
<p>What if you haven't had that gift? Or, like some of us, fought against it and learned some of these lessons the hard way? Our God is a redeemer, and this is where His grace comes in. Not just to save you (praise Him for that!), but to grant you wisdom to teach others not only how to avoid mistakes like yours but also how to repair them by God's grace.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Feast of Trumpets): Num 29:1-6, Matt 24, Rev 11:15-19, 1 Cor 15:50-58<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56398&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Does not wisdom call?' Proverbs 8:1 ESV<br /><br /><p>As we've seen, the book of Proverbs talks a lot about getting wisdom. Why so much? Well, imagine if the Apple store decided that iPads were completely free from now on - you'd think they'd put effort into letting people know about it!</p>
<p>The Bible is clear that wisdom is a completely free gift. It's not something we can buy. Nor is it something we can master just by putting an effort into learning facts. Godly wisdom must be asked for. So if all we have to do is untie the ribbon on the giftbox, how do we do it? The answer is: we open the gift through prayer. Go hard after wisdom. Show God that you are serious about it. Solomon, in 1 Kings 3, decided that wisdom was the only thing worth asking God for. Above money, above more power, above long life, Solomon saw the real riches in wisdom. And he got it.</p>
<p>Get praying. It's simple, but if you have the right motives (and those are important), God will drop wisdom into you, as a gift from Heaven placed in your heart. James 1:17 NIV says, '<em>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.</em>' It will change your ordinary human perception in a way that all the learning and intelligence on earth could never do. Suddenly you see how everything around you fits into God's bigger picture. What on earth could be better?</p>
<p>So to sum up: Do you want wisdom? Look to learn from your earthly parents - spend time with them asking questions. But also, make time to ask your Heavenly Father.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 14-15, Luke 20: 1-8, Ps 142, Pr 23:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56399&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition...' 1 Samuel 1:27 NKJ<br /><br /><p>KP Yohannan is the founder of <em>Gospel for Asia</em>, a missionary organisation that has seen the salvation story brought to millions of people. He has crisscrossed the world and written over 200 books. His <em>Bridge of Hope</em> programme cares for tens of thousands of children breaking free from poverty. This man knows what it means to be used by God. The beginning of his beautiful story, however, is found at the bent knees of a poor Indian woman. Every single week, without fail, KP's mother would pray that one of her children would be saved for the work of God. At the age of eight, KP experienced a conversion. By sixteen, he was crossing India's subcontinent telling all he met about Jesus Christ. Today his legacy has touched millions around the world. The prayers of a mother are powerful.</p>
<p>The Old Testament tells of a similar praying mum who dedicated her baby to the work of God. His name: Samuel. His legacy: a prophet who led Israel for forty years and whose life still serves as an example to Jews and Christians around the globe today. The prayers of a praying mother are powerful.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Paul wrote a list of people who will find it hard to get in on God's rule: <em>Those who change bed partners without a second thought are out</em>. <em>Those who make anything other than God their priority are out</em>. <em>Those who take what isn't theirs are out</em>. A<em>nd those who twist the truth to suit their own needs are out</em>. You can read the full list in 1 Corinthians 6:910.</p>
<p>One that might surprise you: trust-twisters and story-stretchers are out. God is blunt about lies: '<em>No one who is dishonest will live in my house...</em>' (Psalm 101:7 NCV) In God's eyes, lies are up there with sexual immorality and idolatry. So spinning a yarn about why you scratched your dad's car is the same as bowing down to a golden statue of a bull? Apparently so. Seems a bit harsh, doesn't it? Not when you consider who you were created to reflect - God.</p>
<p>His standards are scarily high to works-in-progress like us. However He says we can reach them, and He outright calls us to do so. When Jesus calls for purity, His motive is love for us, and when we mess up, His medicine is His love for us too. There's grace for when we fail, but we should never confuse that with permission not to try. With God, truth is not a 'grey area', so if you have parts of your life that you feel fall into a 'grey area', then confess them. Only when you do will your sins be 'forgiven because of Jesus'.

<introtext><![CDATA['When I am afraid, I will trust in You...' Psalm 56:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Everyone was scared of Goliath. For forty days, he'd swaggered around like a bully, mouthing off about the wimps who were afraid to face him in battle. Then along came this teeny kid called David who wondered out loud why the wimps weren't trusting in God. It got him into two kinds of trouble: (1) his brothers were angry because Goliath was a monster whose every muscle was sprung steel and they didn't like David suggesting they were cowards. (2) the king decided, if David was the only one who wasn't afraid, then he was the obvious choice to face Goliath.</p>
<p>You reckon David must have had second thoughts? You reckoned he must have wondered why he'd opened his big mouth? Certainly he must have felt very small in the shadow of this giant killing machine. But David's ultimate trust wasn't in feelings or reason or strength. David's trust was in the One who could deal with the Philistine bully as easily as breathing. God is always bigger. 'The Lord is my light and my salvation; I will fear no one. The Lord protects me from all danger; I will never be afraid.' (Psalm 27:1 GNT) When giants intimidate you or problems confuse you or fear shouts you down, God always one-ups the bullies. God is always bigger. With God on your side, you can look at the situation differently. Suddenly, it's you who's the giant.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 19:24-21:45, Luke 20:20-26, Ps 112, Pr 23:13-15<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56404&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be still, and know that I am God...' Psalm 46:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Boring, isn't it? Waiting because you are stuck in traffic or trapped at a red light? Well, not anymore. Christian charity <i>Exodus Cry</i> have come up with a revolutionary idea of changing the world whilst you're stuck in traffic. It's called <i>The Red Light Prayer</i> Initiative. Red light districts around the globe are hot spots for harbouring victims of human trafficking. So the <i>Red Light Prayer Initiative</i> asks you to pray about human trafficking and prostitution every time you stop at a traffic light. </p>
<p>So, instead of groaning or venting road rage because you're waiting around for a couple of minutes, you now have the power to loose the chains of injustice. By the time your life is over, it's estimated you will have spent six whole months stuck at traffic lights. What will you have done with those six months? Moaned and groaned or changed the world through prayer? And for those who think prayer is a copout for rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck in, you may be surprised to discover William Wilberforce prioritised prayer as his number one strategy for achieving the abolition of the African slave trade. So what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>On your way to school/college/uni/work or on your way home, start praying at all those annoying traffic lights. Begin by asking God to end trafficking in your own city.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Judge nothing before the appointed time...' 1 Corinthians 4:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Someone once quipped, 'Every footie team could use someone who knows how to play every position, is never offside and never makes an error. The only problem getting him is: it's hard to make him put down his burger and come out of the spectator stands!' If God has given you a dream, or is working in your life, or is giving you hope for a future, don't let the scoffers ruin it. Don't allow the spectators to talk you out of it or tell you how to do it. Only take that kind of advice from people who have been there and done it! Only consider criticism when it is constructive and when you know you are valued by the person advising you - and that they will support you in a practical way, as well as giving advice. If the critics never say anything good about anyone, don't let their words alight on you. Scripture says, 'Judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.' Listen to people you trust. Don't feed the trolls. Instead, seek out a mentor you can trust to spur you on. Invite them to ask you some challenging questions, and to show you encouragement from the heart of God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Col 1-2, Luke 20:41-47, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 23:19-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56405&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus...touched him...' Mark 1:41 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The auctioneer thought it hardly worth his while to waste much time on the battered and scarred old violin, so he held it up with a smile. 'What am I bid for this? A dollar? Who will make it two? And who'll make it three? Three dollars once, twice, going for three.' From the back of the room an old man came forward and picked up the bow. Sweeping the dust from the worn instrument, and tightening the strings, he played beautiful music. The auctioneer turned to the crowd, 'What am I bid for the old violin? A thousand dollars, and two? Two thousand, three? Three thousand once, twice, and gone.'</p>
<p>What changed its worth? The touch of a master's hand. The one who played it so beautifully. At some point or another, we all come to a time when our lives are out of tune, battered and scarred with sin, ready to be auctioned to the thoughtless world. Then, with a touch of the Master's hand, we become God's beautiful instruments, fit to play to Heaven's tune.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God...' Psalm 143:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>God's will, God's way. Sometimes it's the second part of that that's the biggest problem. Especially when time is ticking by. God had promised Abraham: <em>'</em><em>Your children will outnumber the stars and the sands.</em><em>'</em><em> </em>But there he was, getting older in the usual way - day by day. His wife had passed childbearing age a couple of decades previously.<em> </em>It seems, as Abraham thought of God's promise, he wondered whether it actually mention his wife by name.<em> </em>Maybe it was: '<em>Your </em>children will outnumber the stars,'<em> </em>not<em> </em>'<em>Her </em>children...'?</p>
<p>As a result of this rationalisation, Abraham tried to force God's hand and, in doing so, he became the father of Ishmael. But Ishmael wasn't the child of promise that God had in mind. Abraham's mistake didn't cost him his promise because he eventually became the father of Isaac by his wife. However it did cost intense pain all round - pain that has lasted thousands of years and continues to the present day in the conflict between the Jews and the Arabs. There's a lesson here: taking responsibility for your actions doesn't guarantee a future free of ugly consequences. Second lesson: if God makes a promise, there is no mistake too big to stop it being fulfilled.</p>
<p>So if God has given you a promise, specific to your life, count it as a sealed deal. It may take a long time - it may seem like it will never come - but learn from Abraham's mistake and don't take any shortcuts to 'help' God fulfil His promises.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 1-4, Luke 21:12-24, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 23:26-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56407&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...walk by the Spirit...' Galatians 5:16 NAS<br /><br /><p>Fritz Ridenour, a Christian author, writes: 'You want to do right, but you do wrong. You want to choose obedience, but you choose sin. Sometimes you'd almost swear you were a split personality, a regular &quot;walking civil war&quot;.' Sound familiar? Well you're not the only one! And most of us fight our civil war in the shadows, all alone. Satan whispers, 'Face it, you'll never be good enough. Why not just give up and accept the inevitable? You can't change.' But the fleshly desires that get us in to such a mess don't have to be in control. Paul writes, 'Walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.' Did you catch that? You see God's Spirit and our flesh are like oil and water. But when we're walking in the Spirit we don't listen to the desires of the flesh. So, we're listening to the Spirit and we're under His control, or we're listening to the flesh and we're under its control. And that's a choice we must make each day.</p>
<p>Even though you're a new creation the old stuff that tempted you before you met Jesus is still part of the world you live in. There will still be opportunities to make those cutting remarks you used to make. Things won't always go your way and you'll feel that old temper coming on. Lustful thoughts will still invade your mind. So, in the power of the Spirit you must throw up your hands and say, 'God, this stuff is trying to infect me. I can't beat it on my own!' It's at this point that He takes over and the battle goes your way!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 16, Lev 23:26-32, Heb 9:1-14, Heb 13:11-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56408&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be self-controlled and alert.' 1 Peter 5:8 NIV <br /><br /><p>Anyone who has stayed awake in Modern History lessons and hasn't snoozed through the section on the Second World War will know the atrocities didn't stop when victory was finally declared. There was still plenty of mess to mop up - including the liberation of concentration camps. Soldiers were shocked to find great heaps of corpses and barely alive people who looked like skeleton frames. Battles of a different kind raged on - to claim back human dignity and rescue the dying from disease.</p>
<p>Something similar is going on now, in the spiritual world. Christ's death and resurrection has defeated the enemy. The war is won but the battle still rages - the battle to live in God's freedom and rescue the captives from pain and suffering. Jesus described our defeated enemy as one who still tries to 'steal, kill and destroy' (John 10:10 TLB), who 'prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NIV) It took more than good will to overthrow the Nazis. It takes more than brawn to resist the devil. For the next few days we'll look at strategies to keep you strong on the battlefield...</p>
<p>1 Peter 5:8 says, 'Be self-controlled and alert.' How does self-control help resist the devil? If you are alert to your weaknesses and ask God to help you exercise self-control, you won't fall into the devil's snares. So start now, but asking God for that help!</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Day of Atonement): Heb 11:23-28, Ex 3:1-22, Ex 33:7-23, Ex 34:29-35<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56409&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Submit yourselves therefore to God...' James 4:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Gallipoli campaign in the First World War was so confused that no one is sure how many soldiers died - as many as a quarter of a million on each side have been suggested. Tragically, bad orders cost lives. And that's true of the spiritual battlefield also. When we submit our minds to those who know nothing about Jesus, our life is at stake.</p>
<p>If we succumb too much to a fashion designer's current ideals, chances are we will have self-image battles down the line. If we give in to the Hollywood romcom ideal, our relationships will never match up to the false promise films offer. If we fall into the money trap, where might a recession leave us? Fashion, romance, money... none of these things are bad in themselves, but none deserve our full surrender. Jesus is the only General worthy of our full submission. Under His authority, and His alone, we'll have victory in battles: '...Not by [human] might nor by [human] power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts.' (Zechariah 4:6 NKJ) Following His orders <em>will</em> save your life. But we have to take the bold choice of accepting them.</p>
<p>So think about what it is you struggle to give up. Pray that you can leave that thing, hands up in full surrender, at Jesus' cross.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 5-7, Luke 21:25-38, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 23:29-35<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56411&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Resist the devil...he will flee from you' James 4:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>Refuse, refuse, <i>refuse</i> to give in. During the Second World War, the Nazis had occupied France, but a good proportion of French citizens refused to give in to their enemy. The French Resistance were men and women who fought underground with guerrilla warfare tactics and subversive newspapers. The Allies' rapid advance through Normandy is partly thanks to them. </p>
<p>Christians are a Resistance Movement too. Our guerrilla warfare tactics are love, peace, forgiveness and grace - clinging on to the Gospel of truth. We refuse to give in to our enemy. We refuse to concede to the enemy's invitation to greed, hatred, envy, lust and lies. And our atomic bomb is the name of Jesus. At the name of Jesus the enemy is blown to smithereens. 'At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in Heaven and on earth and under the earth.' (Philippians 2:10 NLT) When you resist the devil in the name of Jesus, he has to flee; God promises in Scripture that when you speak and act according to His will, He will speak and act through you Satan cannot break or withstand this chain of command. So join in a Resistance Movement that overcomes greed with kindness, lust with purity, bitterness with forgiveness. Add your assistance to the resistance.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Come near to God and He will come near to you.' James 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>A lone soldier in enemy territory makes an easy target. When you're cut off from your battalion you are prone to attack. Know why it's vital to stay plugged into the Church? Because the Church is your battalion. Yes, God still loves you even if you don't worship Him on a Sunday, but you're not making it easy for yourself in life's battles. You're a sitting duck. Without the encouragement of other Christians it's easy to drift, easy to stagnate, easy to fall. The margins of acceptability become blurred. Without the needs of others in God's family to look out for it's just easier to become self-centred. And, without commitment to God's mission you become just another average Joe or Joe-ette. Before you know it you can't remember where you put your Bible or the last time you prayed.</p>
<p>People who stay away from Church over a long period can develop a bitter taste towards other believers. To love God means to love His people. The enemy wants to drive a wedge between you and God. Don't let Church be His first stab. So, do all you can to get to Church this Sunday. Why not invite somebody who wouldn't ordinarily come along with you?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 11-13, Luke 22:14-23, Ps 78:56-64, Pr 24:5-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56414&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Wash your hands, you sinners...' James 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>A soldier whose wounds go untreated will develop infections or blood loss problems. It's unwise to choose to stay out in the field with no attention to the injury. There will be casualties in a war, but it's not the job of the soldier to heal himself. On the spiritual battlefield you may get hurt. Remember: it's not your job to clean yourself up.</p>
<p>Self-improvement is talked up a lot these days, but in reality it's about as difficult as trying to take a bullet from your spleen while anaesthetised. Removing sin from your life is a job for a specialist - the Holy Spirit. If you leave bitterness or pride or lust untreated, your whole soul will get infected. Eventually something's got to give. So let the Holy Spirit work on your heart with His gentle surgical hands. Your heart generates and stores your beliefs, constructive and destructive. Once you form a belief, right or wrong, you begin to live it out. Faith can be eaten away by infection. The worst of this is that you know what's wrong, yet think you can get away with it. How can you overcome the enemy with a heart full of wrong beliefs and a double mind? Through 'turning over a new leaf'? You can turn over a whole forest but it won't make a difference. No, you must get down before God and say, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a steadfast spirit within me.' (Psalm 51:10 NKJV) When you pray that way, God will cleanse your wounds, wrap you with power, and cause you to walk in victory.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Feast of Tabernacles): Lev 23:33-44, Jn 7:1-40, Zech 14:16-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56415&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['These trials will show that your faith is genuine...' 1 Peter 1:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Faith is like a bucket of water. You only discover how much is inside when somebody bumps into it. When life bumps you, does faith spill out? Bad news from a doctor - does faith spill out, or were you left empty? A friend betrays your trust - does forgiveness or revenge tip over the sides? Your job offer just fell through - is that trust or fear trickling out of the bucket?</p>
<p>You can't tell how much faith somebody has by the size of the Christian fish symbol on their car. But you get a good indication by talking to them when they're in trouble. And trouble does come for Christians - it's promised in the Bible. Not so that God can embarrass you in front of your friends at church, but so you can firm up your faith. Faith is like a muscle. It needs regular exercise. Times of trouble can be a spiritual boot camp for your faith. They're not to reveal how much faith you have, but to refine it - to force out the gunk out of your life and purify it. 'These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold... so when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring... much praise and glory...when Jesus Christ is revealed...'

Psalm 1:1 GWT<br /><br /><p>Russian poet Boris Pasternak wrote this: 'It is not revolutions and upheavals that clear the road to new and better days but someone's soul inspired and ablaze.' The twentieth century saw its fair share of revolutions and upheavals. Pasternak's home country rose up in revolution, and by the end of the century it was left in pieces. Nazi Germany attempted a new order for the world; that ended with the Holocaust - six million Jews killed - and vulnerable groups gassed. In 1989 the world was shocked by the Tiananmen Square massacre, a horrific consequence of the Chinese Revolution.</p>
<p>Not every upheaval automatically paves better days. Yet one soul, one person, can change the world. One Albanian nun decided to reach out to one child in poverty and by the end of her life Mother Teresa had reached out to thousands of children, one by one (not to mention all of those she has impacted and inspired just by her reputation). One Irish doctor gave a home to one poor child and two centuries later, Barnardo's continue to care for the poor. One Jewish scholar was blinded on a road to Damascus and two thousand years later his example of godliness is followed by millions across the planet. You don't need a high government position to change the world - one soul ablaze is enough to rewrite history. The key to the success of Mother Teresa, Dr Barnardo and the apostle Paul was unhurried, uninterrupted time with God. Take time to meditate on Psalm 1. Read it. Memorise it. Live it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Micah 5-7, Luke 22:39-53, Ps 24, Pr 24:15-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56417&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...this precious treasure...is held in perishable containers, that is, in our weak bodies...' 2 Corinthians 4:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>God has given you talents - they're like hidden treasure within you, a 'perishable container'. If you had a stash of jewels hidden inside perishable container like an old clay pot - which part do you think would be valued higher on <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>?</p>
<p>This verse tells us God's treasure is hidden inside our sometimes wobbly, sometimes feeble bodies. All your talents, character, experiences, spiritual gifts are far more valuable than any part of your exterior. Not even your kindness, your wild and witty sense of humour, your loudness, your shyness or your discernment comes anywhere close to your <em>real</em> treasure: the presence of Almighty God shining out of your sometimes shabby self. He's the one who has given you those talents, knows where they're hidden and how to release them. You have so much treasure inside you, the enemy is out to steal it. Jesus said Satan comes '...to steal, kill and destroy...' (John 10:10 TLB) Think about it: you don't try to rob somebody unless they have something worth taking, right? Your talents may be raw and undeveloped, or buried under self-doubt, unconfessed sin, bad habits or despair. But God can take something that looks like nothing, and create something wonderful with it. He made the world from nothing, so it's no big deal for Him.</p>
<p>But God can't shine out of you if you don't have Him within. Have you invited Him to be Lord of your life? Not just your Saviour, the one who rescues you in time of trouble, but your Lord: the one who gave you all your talents and wants you to follow His plan for using them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 17:1-6, 1 Ki 18:16-39, 1 Ki 19:9-18, 2 Ki 2:1-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56420&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Beware of...hypocrisy...' Luke 12:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>We're pretty savvy about the media's tricks these days. If an ad gives us a hard sell on a product we know it's just hype. We expect the product to be outdated in eighteen months' time. If a poster urges us to buy some famous star's range of clothing, we know we'll never look like the airbrushed bronze on the picture. It can't live up to its promise.</p>
<p>Jesus lived in a religiously-hyped community. The Pharisees were promising surefire plans for getting God's approval. Their hype got them a bit of respect and local celebrity but at the expense of making it impossible for anybody else to reach their standards. And if you didn't reach that standard, you couldn't get in on their monopoly on holiness. Good thing Jesus had sussed out their hype. 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, because they are the hypocrites. Everything that is hidden will be shown, and everything that is secret will be made known...' (Luke 12: 2 NIV) Hypocrisy hypes us up. Jesus didn't like it then and He doesn't like it now. So choose sincerity over celebrity, principle over popularity, and honesty over hype. Take a moment for self-examination. Are there areas of 'hype' or 'hypocrisy' in your own life? Today's the day to start getting real.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Tim 1-4, Luke 22:54-62, Ps 19, Pr 24:19-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56422&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We will find grace to help us when we need it most.' Hebrews 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>That's true if you want six-pack abs. But we're talking about grace - and that's not about you putting in the crunches and the hard work! Grace is about receiving the approval of God without feeling the burn. God gives you the nod even though you haven't worked hard at being the perfect citizen. Yes, it's good to help old ladies across the road, read your Bible regularly and give some spare cash to the homeless, but none of this gives you extra credit with God - you already have credit overflowing, a bank account filled to the brim.</p>
<p>Grace can't be earned like a spiritual salary; grace is the gift under the tree already bought and wrapped for you. So, we don't have to struggle to try and put a smile on God's face. Jesus paid a hefty price for our gift, just so that we don't ever need to struggle. His cross isn't a new name for our struggle. We can let go of our independence and rest in God-dependence. 'Have you lost your senses? After starting your Christian lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?' (Galatians 3:3 NLT) No pain. Just gain.</p>
<p>(But wait. There's more. An aim to live a holy life is still important, but only as a <em>r</em><em>esponse</em> to God's grace - not as an attempt to earn it. That's how it works!) So, learn to let go and to count on God's grace. He is more than willing to help you so long as you let go of your independent attitude.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 1-4, Luke 22:63-71, Ps 3, Pr 24:23-25<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56426&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the Word of God.' 1 Samuel 9:27 KJV<br /><br /><p>Here's an ancient Scripture with a modern message: 'As Saul, his servant and Samuel were getting near the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, &quot;Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay, because I have a message from God for you.&quot;' (1 Samuel 9:27 NCV)</p>
<p>Now, Saul probably had a thousand and one things to do. But nothing was more important than stopping right there and then to hear from God. Had he rushed ahead without staying, he would've missed the news that God had appointed him to be Israel's first king. Wow! I wonder what news you may have missed out on simply because you were too busy to stop and listen. Work, college, friends, music, games, shopping and endless other things are all vying for our time. And we're given the impression if we drop any of them we'll pay some sort of price. <em>But the real price is paid from dropping our connection to God.</em> Busyness leads to empty spirituality. We become deaf to God's plans because we haven't stopped to listen. 'Never let the fire in your heart go out. Keep it alive. Serve the Lord.' (Romans 12:11 NIV) Timeout! Refuel on prayer and catch up with God's latest news. Prioritise 'listening to God' time today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 5-8, Luke 23:1-12, Ps 39, Pr 24:26-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56428&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[control-your-emotions-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Cain, why are you angry?' Genesis 4:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Unless you learn to control your emotions you'll lose credibility, push people away and miss great opportunities. Your emotions are like a car: properly understood and directed it can take you places; out of control it can destroy you. When God asked Cain, 'Why are you angry with your brother?' He was saying: 'Listen up, Cain! Your emotions are sending you a message. If you don't get a handle on this, you'll create a mess you won't be able to live with. Yes, you'll repent and regret it, but you won't be able to undo it.' But Cain wouldn't listen. The situation seemed unfair; he felt unappreciated. He thought his brother's blessing had come at his expense. What emotions were at work here? Jealousy. Resentment. Competitiveness. Feeling like the victim. These unchecked forces caused him to murder his brother Abel and cross a line he could never undo.</p>
<p>Most of us have a knee-jerk reaction that isn't necessarily controlled by the rational or sensible side of our brain. It reacts to people and events, and like a sudden storm rises with strength from within, sometimes overwhelming us. The author Gordon McDonald writes: 'I used to pride myself on the fact that I kept my emotions to myself. I never saw myself as an angry person... Then I got married and my wife informed me that I had plenty of anger after all. While it rarely came out in words it showed itself in full colour in facial expressions (the &quot;gift of glare&quot;, we called it) I never knew I had. I had work to do. I had emotions that needed to be disciplined.' How about you?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 9-11, Luke 23:13-25, Ps 34, Pr 24:29-31<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56429&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't be angry or furious. Anger can lead to sin.' Psalm 37:8 CEV<br /><br /><p>Mike Singleterry, who played for the Chicago Bears American Football team, was a star player - and a Christian. One day, however, while they were losing, the hometown fans got really aggressive and started dissing him. He didn't like it. The TV cameras trained on Singleterry's face as he glowered at the crowd. Suddenly he lost his temper and started toward the stands, shouting back. It wasn't his finest hour. But after the game may have been. That's when he met with the press and apologised. No excuses, no blaming: just an apology. His emotions had got out of control and he took responsibility. Perhaps Singleterry had read these words: 'A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offence.' (Proverbs 19:11 NIV) As you go through life people will offend you. Sometimes it will be deliberate, other times they won't even realise. The question is; what are you going to do about it?</p>
<p>Spiritually mature people discipline their emotions and make sure they accurately reflect reality. They can be sad, joyful, angry or elated in appropriate ways at appropriate times. They refuse to allow their emotions to determine their actions, attitude or choices. One Christian author writes: 'When I feel things going against me, when feelings of anger and resentment begin to rise it's time to stop and ask what's happening. Is this for the greater good, or not? Is God speaking to me, or isn't He? Will my flesh rule this moment, or my spirit?' That's good advice for us too!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 12-14, Luke 23:26-34, Ps 52, Pr 24:32-34<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56430&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He had compassion on them and healed their sick.' Matthew 14:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Before you congratulate yourself on having your emotions in check, understand that there's another side to the coin - you can have control but no compassion - you can get worked up about human suffering but not do anything. James talks about the people who are churchgoers, who feel sorry for others but don't act. They see the pain and unmet needs of people. They have the ability to do something about it. They feel sorry but they walk away muttering about being too busy. Or they try to relieve their conscience with a token gift. James says, '...faith without works is dead.' (James 2:20 KJV) If we are not responsible, who is? If we don't do something, who will?</p>
<p>You're only disciplining your emotions if you don't translate them into responsible action. And your 'somebody ought to do something about this' rants won't get <strong><em>you</em></strong> off the hook. William Barclay wrote: 'There is nothing more dangerous than the repeated experience of a fine emotion with no attempt to put it into action. It is a fact that every time a man feels a noble impulse without taking action, he becomes less likely ever to take action. In a sense it is true to say that a man has no right to feel sympathy, unless he at least tries to put that sympathy into action. An emotion is not something [to enjoy as a luxury]; it is something which at the cost of effort and of toil, of discipline and of sacrifice, must be turned into the stuff of life.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 1-3, Luke 23:35-43, Ps 54, Pr 25:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56432&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet.' Ezekiel 37:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Imagine yourself as Ezekiel in today's passage, led by God into a valley of dry bones. Death round your ankles, you pick your way through the remains of the once-living. Not the sort of place you'd imagine learning something amazing about the purposes of God.</p>
<p>But God said to Ezekiel, 'Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say, &quot;Dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord... I am going to put breath into you and make you live again!&quot;' (Ezekiel 37:9 NLT) That's exactly what happened when Ezekiel obeyed God. He saw dry bones listen up to the voice of God, and turn into an army of living people. God literally breathed life into this deathly situation, and Ezekiel had the privilege to witness it.</p>
<p>What is God up to in our lives? And the lives of people around us? Like Ezekiel, God tells us to speak life into desperate situations and He makes it happen. When you see people changing lives with God, living like Jesus, chances are they went through a valley of real hurt, devastation and rejection of their own. And if that's where you are now, God <em>can</em> breathe on the dry bones around you, you <em>can</em> see Him deliver you. 'In the day of trouble ...my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me... I will sing...to the Lord.' (Psalm 27:5-6 NIV) That's how you give praise in bad times and are able to look back and say, 'Thank you for the experience, Lord. Without it I'd never have got to know You like I do today.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:7, Gen 6:9-22, Gen 8:18-22, Matt 24:36-41<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56433&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God has...given us...a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It seems to happen all the time in soccer: the losing team enters the second half and start having rather a lot of 'special injury moments'. A slight trip leads to an agonising grimace and all of a sudden the player's on the ground, massaging his leg. It's fear of losing that inspires foul play. But let's face it, all it does is make the player look 'stoopid', and he loses the respect of the crowd.</p>
<p>Making choices, relating to people and living your life from a mindset of fear will never bring the right outcome. That's because fear isn't a feeling from God. In the Bible it says 'God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ) We improve our lives by listening to God - every minute of listening to fear sets us back. If you really want to live differently, it has to start in your mind first, not your actions. Romans 12:2 NLT says this: 'Let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.'</p>
<p>Where does God want to take your thinking? Do you want to succeed where you've failed before? To become the person you always hoped to be? Don't start by changing your actions, start by changing your mind. Renew it daily with God's Word. Nothing you do will have as great an impact.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 4-6, Luke 23:44-56, Ps 13, Pr 25:4-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56434&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['His compassions...are new every morning...' Lamentations 3:22-23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Imagine you're a screenwriter invited to pitch to some Christian film studio boss. You open the door to his massive office. You stand awkwardly in front of his rich mahogany desk. He's expecting an inspiring new movie about God's love. You begin your pitch for <em>Lamentations: The Movie</em>: 'Er, it's a story about everything going wrong. A journey of people reaping bad times from all the sin they've sown. Most of them die.' Tough sell.</p>
<p>When you're going through tough times do you feel like letting your non-Christian friends know? Do you think it might sound like a bad pitch for God, so you keep your mouth shut instead? Well, in the midst of harsh reality in <em>Lamentations</em>, Jeremiah said this: 'Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.'</p>
<p>Does the pitch sound quite so bad now? While acknowledging times are tough, if we know deep in our souls God is at work, it changes everything. It's very powerful. Everyone has tough times. So be vulnerable. Don't be scared to be truthful with your friends. Your honesty in hard times could make their idea of who God is a lot more real for them. So think about a tough time where God really came through for you. Thank Him and pray for an opportunity to share your story with someone today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 7-9, Luke 24:1-12, Ps 91, Pr 25:9-12   <br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56436&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not covet...' Exodus 20:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Late night fridge raids are a terrible idea. So are similar things in other parts of our lives. It's like surfing the web of behaviour options, looking out for something that might make you happier than you are at the moment. When you're not satisfied with what you've got, but not sure what you do want, and are just looking to see if something grabs your attention, then you're looking for trouble. The Bible says: 'Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.' (Romans 8:5 NLT) Setting your eyes on something you don't need or shouldn't have is just inviting danger into your life.</p>
<p>Just like you don't need to stuff your face when you're not really hungry, you don't need to set your mind or heart on having those things that aren't up to God's standard or measure. Remember, '...people become enemies of God when they are controlled by their human nature; for they do not obey God's law, and in fact they cannot obey it.' (Romans 8:7 GNT)</p>
<p>As you spend time with God, focus on thanking Him for all the things you do have rather than asking Him for the things you don't. An attitude of gratitude is one weapon God gives us against covetousness - so use it today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 12-14, Luke 24:25-35, Ps 68:19-35, Pr 25:17-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56438&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p>God delivered His people from slavery in Egypt, and they were pretty happy with that. Did they stay happy? No, not for long. Like conceited celebrities used to living in a mansion of privilege, they were unhappy with God's menu. They were ready to swap their freedom for a zucchini! In addition, they wanted meat and plenty of it. It didn't matter that God had rescued them and given them everything they needed for their journey out of slavery. What did God say? '[I'll] give you meat, and you will eat it...until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it...' (Numbers 11:18-20 NIV)</p>
<p>Have you ever heard the saying, 'Be careful what you wish for'? Because the Israelites thought something else could satisfy them in a way that God couldn't, He gave them exactly what they asked for, but along with it they got an empty heart.</p>
<p>Would you rather have a life emptied of God or a life emptied of 'stuff'? Learn from the Israelites about recognising God's answer to prayers. Take the time to get to the place where the central desire of your life is, 'God, I just want more of You.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 15-16, Luke 24:36-44, Ps 60, Pr 25:21-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56439&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let your conduct be without covetousness...' Hebrews 13:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Covetousness. A mouthful to say, and pretty hard for God to swallow. What does it mean though? Here's an (all too everyday...) example for you: There's a new iPhone out. Or car. Or bike. Or your friend has just booked the holiday you've always dreamed of. Covetousness is about anything that makes you lick your lips and start wishing you had it. [It works with people too, not just objects - the commandment to 'Not covet your neighbour's wife' (Deuteronomy 5:21) is talking about exactly the same attitude...]</p>
<p>Being so greedy for money possessions or fame, you'll do pretty much anything to get what you want is <em>covetousness</em> in a nutshell. To recognise it in yourself when it pops up: it begins with a craving, followed by schemes of how to get it. In the book of Hebrews it says, 'Stay away from the love of money [and material things]; be satisfied with what you have. For God has said, &quot;I will never fail you. I will never forsake you.&quot;' (Hebrews 13:5 NLT)</p>
<p>It's impossible to think about a desire for any length of time without rationalising a way to get it. Covetousness maximises the desire while minimising the danger. Yielding is inevitable: just a matter of time. Change your focus! Set your mind on Jesus and ask Him about all those things you feel you can't live without. Ask Him too to set your mind on 'the things of the Spirit.' (Romans 8:5 NKJ)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 10-11, Luke 24:13-24, Ps 68:1-18, Pr 25:13-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56437&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be content with such things as you have...' Hebrews 13:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you're asking God for something just because someone else has got it, you're bound to be disappointed. It may feel like an entirely reasonable request - sometimes however, it can be coming from a place of resentment or envy. We can look to others and want what they have, but the Bible says this: 'No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.' (Psalm 84:11 NAS)</p>
<p>When God seems to be keeping things from you (like a special relationship), you need to trust Him rather than resent others. He's much too good a Dad to give you things that you're not actually ready for. It could even be that He wants you to hunger after a deeper relationship with Him, rather than a longed-for relationship that doesn't exist yet. Work with what you've got and God will bring along all you need. When you covet something and beg for what you don't have, you're asking Him to replace Himself with something you consider more important. Is your problem that you're not satisfied with God alone? Do you want God plus a great job, a perfect partner, a penthouse apartment? Then remember the words of Jesus: '...Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.' (Luke 12:15 NKJ) Life is not built on things, it's built on relationships. And the first relationship that needs your attention is the one with God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 1-3, Luke 24:45-53, Ps 51, Pr 25:23-25<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56440&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Grace be unto you, and peace, from God...' 1 Corinthians 1:3 KJV<br /><br /><p>Peace - what do you think of? Sixties hippies and flower power? Nineties rappers leaving the stage? A handshake during the church service? 'Peace' wasn't Paul's catchphrase. For you, today, and through all history, peace actually means something very different. God's peace, '...exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds.' (Philippians 4:7 NLT) In other words, it's that unearthly gift of resting contentedly in God, no matter what's happening around you. How good would that be?</p>
<p>Paul understood you can't get peace without experiencing and living with God. Here are three things to understand about the grace of God that lets us live like that: (1)<em> It can</em><em>'</em><em>t be earned </em>(2)<em> it</em><em>'</em><em>s God doing for you what you can</em><em>'</em><em>t do for yourself </em>(3)<em> it doesn</em><em>'</em><em>t kick in until you stop struggling and doing things in your own strength. </em>It's about being humble. It's understanding that God is much bigger than you, and you need Him every day. It's learning to trust God by the only way possible - doing it! It's learning to wait on him to supply what you need when you need it. There will never be a day you don't need God's grace! Once you realise that, and decide to sit with Him in every moment, you'll never be in short supply of peace.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:8-12, Gen 17:1-27, Gen 22:1-18, James 2:21-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56442&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Healing For Your Grief]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[healing-for-your-grief]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He heals the brokenhearted...' Psalms 147:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever dropped a mentos into a bottle of Diet Coke? Grief can do that to our emotions. One day you're fine, then suddenly you're walking around exploding inside. More than anything, you want to let go of your emotions, but you feel like you need to keep them tightly contained. And you can only do that for so long. Let it build up too much and you'll detonate. The world around you will get very messy. If it happens at the wrong time it can badly affect others around us.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear. After a serious loss, you need to allow yourself time and space to grieve. Grief isn't self-indulgent, it's a necessary part of being human. Jesus wept with the family of a dead friend to share His feelings with them - and because He genuinely hurt, too. Let people share your loss with you by opening up when you need to. A way that might help is extending your family by confiding in friends and people who you know you can trust and care about you. If you're grieving now, know that God is for you, especially at this time. Grief is draining, so you might need to rest more than usual. It may affect your appetite - but you need to respect your body's need to eat, drink and exercise.</p>
<p>Romans 8:31 says you can pray without words - in fact that God prays through you without words. If you're lost for words, simply go to Him. Run to God with your pain, not away from Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 4-6, John 1:1-13, Ps 63, Pr 25:26-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56443&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['My people will live in peaceful dwelling places...' Isaiah 32:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Stress is pretty bad for anyone. Really bad. It not only mangles your head, it can give you some seriously nasty physical side effects too. Headaches, a rash, feeling sick, affecting your sleep, undereating, overeating, and feeling constantly on the edge of tears, all can be stress nailing your body as well as your mind.</p>
<p><em>Newsflash! </em>God doesn't want that! He wants us to walk with a sound mind and trust in Him: 'Give all your worries and cares to God, for He cares about you.' (1 Peter 5:7 NLT) Talking to God, and sharing with a friend, can make you realise you've been listening to the father of lies rather than God's truth. We can let the devil wreck havoc in our minds if we're not careful. There he is in his waiter's outfit, dishing out lies, shaking the truth into a twisted cocktail and making you see small problems as massive mountains. A lot of the time they're actually just 'one-step-at-a-time' molehills. If you have problems burdening you and you're finding it hard to cope, you may need to see a doctor or counsellor to help you unpick the way you're feeling. Be strong and courageous by speaking out. Don't suffer in silence. Also take time to rest with God. Worshipping, singing about how good God is, can take our minds off ourselves and our circumstances. In fact, many people testify to what it says in the Bible: that praising God can actually change our stressy circumstances.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 7-9, John 1:14-28, Ps 92, Pr 26:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56444&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord...' Psalm 107:8 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist writes, 'Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord, for His goodness...' The word 'would' is crucial. A thankful attitude is a <em>choice</em>, especially when it has to be made in spite of the situation you are facing. You choose your attitude just like you choose the food you eat and the clothes you wear. And there's plenty to be grateful for. You might say, 'Yes, but there's plenty to complain about too.' Yeah - and there's the reason you need to make a choice!</p>
<p>Have you ever read <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, a novel based on a true story of a shipwrecked castaway? Just a reminder: he spent twenty-seven years on a desert island. At one point he writes a journal entry where he contrasts all the things he has to complain about (let's call it his 'Gripe List') with all the things he has to be thankful for (his 'Gratitude List'). Here's an example (paraphrased): Gripe: 'I'm stuck on this desert island without hope.' Gratitude: 'I wasn't drowned like the rest of my ship's company.' Gripe: 'I've no clothes.' Gratitude: 'I'm in a hot climate; if I had clothes I couldn't wear them.'</p>
<p>See what he's doing? It's powerful stuff! It isn't Disneyworld thinking to focus on the good things of life, it's wisdom! If there's something you've been complaining about recently, turn it around into gratitude. Bring God into that situation by asking Him to show you how, and see what happens!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 10-12, John 1:29-42, Ps 29, Pr 26:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56445&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['That...which we have heard...seen...touched.' 1 John 1:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you feel like you're having a long-distance relationship with God? <em>Well, yeah. God</em><em>'</em><em>s in Heaven, so that</em><em>'</em><em>s pretty long-</em><em>distance?</em> No. God's everywhere, and immediately present with you right now, even as you read this! He's not off somewhere in the stratosphere chilling out with angels. Be careful that your praying doesn't come across like you're tearing God away from a harp recital in Heaven to invite Him into your room instead. He's already there. If anything, God's waiting for our awareness of Him rather than the other way round. The Bible says, 'He who watches over you will not slumber.' (Psalm 121:3 NIV)</p>
<p>Have you noticed that when you hang around with the same person a lot you start picking up on their traits and being more like them? It's the same with God. The more you hang around with Him the more you'll grow in Chris-tlike characteristics. Compassion is one of these characteristics. As a young disciple, John wanted to call fire down from heaven on a town that refused overnight accommodation to Christ and His disciples (Luke 9:54). But after a lifetime of walking with Jesus he wrote, 'Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.' (1 John 4:8 NIV)</p>
<p>Pray to God now, thanking Him that He's with you and that you would love to hear from Him. He's a living, present God with things to say to you today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 13-15, John 1:43-51, Ps 131, Pr 26:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56446&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Every morning, I tell you what I need, and I wait for your answer.' Psalm 5:3 NCV<br /><br /><p>Ever thought, '<i>Why is it easier to pray and read the Bible at youth group camp than it is at home?</i>'<i> </i>Maybe the answer is we make time for it there. Perhaps the morning session sets us up for the day. CS Lewis thought it did. He wrote: 'The moment you wake up each morning...all your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists in shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other, larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in.' </p>
<p>Get into the swing of prayer by offering your waking thoughts to God. It could be as simple as lying in your bed and saying, 'Thank you, God, for the night's rest, and the gift of living another day. Today, I belong to You.' Or it could be that you consciously pray to invite Him to be more and more at home in your heart so you want to spend more time with Him.</p>
<p>Frank Laubach wrote that he would pray every two or three minutes, 'Am I in Your will, Lord? Am I pleasing You, Lord?' Why not try such an approach today? Set yourself the goal of remembering at breakfast, lunch and tea to pray a similar prayer.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-parental-promise]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>The sentence following the fifth commandment makes it stand out from the rest. As Paul points out in Ephesians 6:3 NLT, 'If you honour your father and mother, things will go well with you, and you will have a long life on the earth.' That's great, but this promise isn't to be taken on the cheap. Honouring your parents is much more than thinking nice things about them. Proverbs 19:20 NIV says, 'Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise.' The extent to which the promise comes true in your life is reflected in the extent to which you take godliness on board. Fulfilling your domestic duties round the house while stealing from work will still land you in trouble.</p>
<p>Your parents aren't perfect. But God still requires you to honour them. Sometimes this may be through gratitude for the great things they've done and sometimes through forgiveness for the way they've hurt you. No doubt about it, this can sometimes be the toughest possible call! But, think for a moment, are things going well for you? And if they aren't, it may just be that it's time to connect the dots! Could it have something to do with whether or not you are honouring your parents? And if you think that honouring them is impossible, just turn to the God who makes all things possible.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:22, Gen 39:1-23, Gen 45:1-11, Gen 50:15-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56447&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you believe in Jesus Christ as your Saviour, a plethora of blessings become yours. In addition to the happiness of sins forgiven and full access to your Heavenly Father's goodness, there's other good stuff too. For one - you instantly gain a new family.</p>
<p>Jesus set a few people straight about families in what was probably a pretty awkward moment. Read it in Mark 3. His biological mum and brothers came asking for a quiet word. Then came a pertinent question. 'Who is My mother...?' (Mark 3:33 NLT) He answered, 'Anyone who does God's will is My brother and sister and mother.' (Mark 3:35 NLT) There's a different perspective on family if ever there was one!</p>
<p>This wasn't about brushing His dear mum aside. He still cared deeply about her (see John 19:25-27, for instance). It was about recognising His family as those who are properly committed to what His Father wants. Jesus wouldn't have treated the older women in His life any better or worse than His own mum. In Jesus' approach to family matters, the whole of God's family mattered.</p>
<p>Is there an older person in your life that you haven't been respecting quite as they deserve? How can you put that right today?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 22-24, John 3:1-21, Ps 89:1-14, Pr 26:17-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56448&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you've got Christian parents, then thank God for them. If not, don't stop praying for God to save the people who've been entrusted with your care. But also recognise the most likely way they'll come to know Jesus will be you. And there's nothing more convicting than a good example of a son or daughter of God - <em>you </em>are what they see of <em>Jesus</em>. How they see Him will have more to do with the way you are with them, than the words you use to describe Him. If you rave on about how much God loves them but you can't find the time to do the chores you promised, you're losing points big time. Think of the words attributed to St Francis of Assisi: 'preach the Gospel at all times and if necessary use words.'</p>
<p>In an ideal world, our parents should be setting a good example for us to follow - and making it easy to happily do as they say! But in the real world, parents are just as flawed as anyone else. God's command to honour them isn't dependent on whether you think they deserve it. The test will be when they ask you to do something that doesn't fit with your commitment to God. That's when you most need His help.</p>
<p>Pray for families who aren't Christians. How brightly are you shining as a son or daughter of God, and a witness to Jesus?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 25-27, John 3:22-36, Ps 89:15-37, Pr 26:20-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56452&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['By your patience possess your souls.' Luke 21:19 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Patience reminds us that our lives work on God's schedule, not our own: 'Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that He has promised.' (Hebrews 10:36 NLT) He works from His own divinely considered all-knowing timetable. If you think about it, expecting your own homemade timetable to fit perfectly in line with God's is pretty silly. Who's seen what's going to happen tomorrow: you or the Author of life itself?</p>
<p>So don't panic if God seems like He's on a go-slow - it's because He's making everything just right for you. If you know God has you where He wants you, but you start to feel itchy, don't be tempted to run on ahead of Him! Your impatience will just make you and everybody around you miserable. Patient endurance can mean honouring God in a situation when you'd far rather pack up and leave. He knows what He's doing - and, if He hasn't told you, that's probably for the (<em>your!</em>) best!</p>
<p>Are you making up reasons to ignore what God has asked you to stick with? Take the time to pray for God's clear voice on the matter and if necessary, for faith to leave all your nagging doubts behind.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 28-29, John 4:1-12, Ps 89:38-52, Pr 26:23-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56453&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Anger resides in the lap of fools.' Ecclesiastes 7:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Whether it's complaining about people jumping the queue at your local take-out or sounding off about your mates behind their backs, the Bible says this, 'Fools vent their anger, but the wise quietly hold it back.' (Proverbs 29:11 NLT)</p>
<p>It's ok to share your feelings with those you trust and who aren't walking targets for anger. But think wisely about what you say and who you tell, because you don't want your words to bite back. For times when you feel like a flaming Bunsen burner, here's a tip: count your blessings, particularly the fact you have God, salvation, health, family, job - whatever fits. You can also get rid of some excess adrenaline by getting active physically rather than vocally. Obviously don't get physical with people - <em>word4U</em> HQ is definitely not advocating headkicking! More like kicking a football around or taking a good long run. It's a good time to count those blessings and also helps clear your head to think rationally and handle things in a way you won't regret afterwards. And if you're anger prone, challenge yourself to learn a couple of Scriptures to grab from your mind when you need it most. Start with Proverbs 14:17 NLT - 'Short-tempered people do foolish things...'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 30-32, John 4:13-26, Ps 100, Pr 26:27-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56454&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[searching-for-contentment]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My people have...forsaken...the...living water and...dug...broken cisterns.' Jeremiah 2:13 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The search for contentment takes us to strange places. Sometimes we even use other people as a means to find peace of mind - as strange as that sounds. You might hear yourself saying, '<em>Oh, I</em><em>'</em><em>d be alright if I just got a boyfriend or girlfriend</em>.' Well, every relationship goes through tough times. How would you feel then? What happens when they don't call when they say they will? Relationships aren't a cruise of contentment, and they definitely aren't to be used as a tool for reaching contentment. Because if you expect someone to provide you with contentment, you're setting them up for failure.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you're looking for contentment that lasts, it's only found in Jesus. Paul had to learn this: 'I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content. I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:11-13 NKJ) The most humbling fact is that Paul wrote these words in (a pretty grim) prison. He wasn't writing it with his arm round a loved one. He realised the true value of things and people. They come and go. Loved ones die. The friendship of God is always with you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Epaphroditus... ministered to my need.' Philippians 2:25 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The word <em>encouragement</em> basically means to 'put in courage'. The roads of life are bumpy and full of potholes, and can cause rips and tears and punctures in our 'tyres'. Jesus knows exactly how it is - He walked the earth and plainly stated, '<em>each day has enough trouble of its own</em>.' (Matthew 6:34 NIV) What better way to repair the damage to the tyres than to seal the holes with some encouragement?</p>
<p>But everybody's wired in their own unique way and will appreciate different mixes of encouragement: words of affirmation, spending quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service (yes, that's doing the dishes, cleaning the gross fish tank) and physical touch (a pat on the back, a solid handshake, a hug for a friend) are all ways of going about it.</p>
<p>Take the time to find out how best to encourage those people around you, and you might find it revolutionises your relationships. Have you noticed someone make a positive change in their life? Don't keep it to yourself, affirm them - it could be the thing that keeps them heading in the right direction. Hebrews 3:13 NIV says, '<em>...encourage one another daily, as long as it is called &quot;Today&quot;, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</em>' Take up the challenge today - look at the people you have around you and ask God to help you be a useful encouragement to them when they need it. There is no greater calling!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 27-31, Luke 6:1-16, Ps 122, Pr 17:18-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54144&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes from hearing the message... through the Word...' Romans 10:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>'And you were made for movement. You were made to participate in this movement of God. This is what you were born for. You were not born to live a small ordinary life of safe boundaries, tidy fences, you were made for more... You were made to go, to journey, to become the vanguard of God's purposes in this generation. To go to the forgotten places. To go to the forsaken. To be a herald, to be a witness, to be a prophet. To be a friend...'</p>
<p>Matt Wilson's book <em>Concrete Faith</em> describes faith that's solid because it's grounded in the concrete realities of love, relationship and sacrifice. It's natural to run off the buzz of the initial excitement of God's calling on your life, but once that's gone, what's left is the difficult daily reality of life as a Christian, a journey filled with all the challenges that this life throws at you.</p>
<p>As you run the race, make sure your faith is grounded and concrete. The book of James is full of the same gritty reality of what faith in Jesus really looks like: '<em>If people say they have faith, but do nothing, their faith is worth nothing. Can faith like that save them? ...In the same way, faith by itself that does nothing - is dead</em>.' (James 2:14,17 NCV) So put your faith into action. It's not just about hearing the Word but by acting on it. The moment you set your wheels in motion your faith springs to life, inviting God to move on your behalf.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 3-5, Luke 10:1-12, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 19:21-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54710&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Everything I plan will come to pass...' Isaiah 46:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Families, friends and life experiences can create fears and limitations that hold us back. We go about life doing the best we can in this messy mixed up world in which we live, but if we're not careful we can allow these fears to take over. We can live by the labels put on us by others: 'not good enough, not up to the task, never make it, won't succeed'. Or we label ourselves: 'useless, worthless, a mistake'. These labels can cause us to live believing we don't matter, our life is irrelevant, and unimportant, and even that we are unwanted. Nothing could be further from the truth. God doesn't make mistakes. You're not here by accident! You <em>'are God'</em><em>s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.'</em> (Ephesians 2:10 NLT) '<em>I know the plans I have for you,</em><em> says the Lord. </em><em>They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.</em>'<em> </em>(Jeremiah 29:11 NLT) Don't live a life of fear! Instead, receive God's confident guaranteed hope for your life! He promises <em>'Everything I plan will come to pass...'</em> Take off your labels. God is building a solid foundation under you so that you'll be able to handle the pressures that accompany His blessing, and go through the storms of life without being moved or shaken. Anything that's made well and worth having is made slowly and worth fighting for. Jesus gave His life for you - that's how much He thought of you. Why should you think less?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Luke 10:13-24, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 19:24-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54711&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Son...all that I have is yours.' Luke 15:31 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'<em>All these years I've worked hard for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to; and in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends. Yet when this son of yours comes back after spending your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the finest calf we have on the place.</em>' (Luke 15:29-30 TLB)</p>
<p>This parable is part of a collection of lost items in Luke 15, in this case a lost son who comes back home, but it's the only one that doesn't get a happily-ever-after Hollywood ending. Instead, we're left with a seething self-righteous brother all knotted up with resentment. Not a great way to end up in one of Jesus' stories. By focusing on the older brother's bad attitude, Jesus was holding up a mirror to the religious faithful who chose resentment instead of rejoicing.</p>
<p>It's very easy to be more like the bitter big brother than the forgiving father. Watch out that you don't take all the glory if you have stayed on the straight and narrow path. It was a really good thing that the older brother stayed home - he was with his father and everything his father had was his. The guy was insanely blessed already - but over time, he'd become blind to the blessing. Remind yourself every day not to take God's blessing for granted. If you're already a Christian, you're already home with the Father and totally accepted by Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 1:1-4:16, Luke 6:17-26, Ps 137, Pr 17:22-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54146&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pure... religion before God... is this...' James 1:27 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you tell your mate that you've become a Christian, they might dismiss it or say you've 'got into religion'. If they haven't walked away by then, you might have the chance to gently explain it's more about living relationship, not 'old-fashioned religion'. Yet were often so eager to distance ourselves from this boring old idea of 'religion' that everyone seems to picked up from the media, that we seem obsessed with showing how 'not religious' we are. 'Religion', as many think, is about what you can't or won't do (read:<em> the rules</em>). But is 'religion' a bad thing altogether?</p>
<p>James describes it this way: '<em>...to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</em>' (James 1:27 NIV) The two parts of this verse show that it's not just about what we don't do, but just as importantly, it's about using all we've got to make a positive impact. Jesus said, '<em>Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.</em>' (Matthew 25:40 NIV) And when the Pharisees asked what the greatest commandment was, He gave two answers: '<em>Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: Love your neighbour as yourself.</em>' (Matthew 22:37-39 NLT) So for Jesus, there wasn't much difference between loving God and loving people. So no more holy huddles - practice pure religion by reaching out and helping people in need in your community.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 4:17-6:24, Luke 6:27-36, Ps 79, Pr 17:24-26<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54147&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All you need to say is simply &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;...' Matthew 5:37 NIV<br /><br /><p>When does a good thing become 'too much'? You're helping out a friend-in-need, but it's starting to take the life out of you too... Or you're that person in trouble, and you aren't sure if your mates have got your back...</p>
<p>Today's verse is about clarity, and integrity. The passage it's taken from tells us not to swear oaths, but to be trustworthy by just our 'Yes' or 'No'. The same is true when we're dealing with people around us, especially if they're in a tough spot. If we don't give them a straight-up Yes or No when we're relating to them, we lack the integrity that we owe to them, and to God.</p>
<p>Needing to be needed by needy people (try saying that three times quickly), puts the needy person in the driver's seat - and can quickly drive you over the edge. The more you do to make them feel less... whatever they feel... and make yourself feel less guilty, the more they might resent you for not giving as much as they think you should, and you end up in a double bind - neither of you able to break the cycle.</p>
<p>Recognise yourself in there? If so, youre already moving toward a healthier, less toxic relationship. Over the next few days keep reading to dig a little deeper and, in the meantime, take a good look at your health levels - both you and your friends will be glad of your honesty. And if you're beating about the bush, make an effort to be honest (as well as gracious!) all day today. If you find a person or situation you struggle to be straight-talking in, it's time to start praying!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 1:1-3:21, Luke 6:37-49, Ps 109:1-15, Pr 17:27-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... its parts should have equal concern for each other.' 1 Corinthians 12:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>While you're taking a good look at the areas of your life that drain you, be careful not to leap back in horror and jump right to the other extreme. It's easy to start holding off your friends and class/work-mates like a madman with a bargepole. We were made for relationships, to live connected lives where we're known and understood by others. That means more than just showing off your best side. Intimacy means being vulnerable enough to let others in on the real you, including your less attractive bits. Our human nature can put up a '<em>Keep out, trespassers will be prosecuted!</em>' sign as we try to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>It can be crazy terrifying to let someone in that close. We think, 'You can't hurt me if I keep you at a safe distance.' But God didn't design us to live in isolation. So when we're brave enough to reach out to others (whether that's God or other people), we'll find people can quickly grow from being polite acquaintances to true and meaningful friends (it sounds a bit like a <em>Neighbours</em> theme, but it's true). When you draw close to God, it's from a place of trust and safety that He can say big things to you - things you might not want to listen to but He knows you need to hear. Reach out! You were created to give to others, and to receive what they have to give back to you. In giving you are fulfilled, and in receiving you are made complete. Anything less is just existing.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, Luke 7:1-10, Ps 109:16-31, Pr 18:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Like a city with broken-down walls.' Proverbs 25:28 NLT<br /><br /><p>Psychologists experimented with school children to see how they reacted when boundaries were taken away from their playground at break time. Normally they'd play happily, lining the fences and having fun. But when the fences were removed, the children huddled in the middle of the playground, anxious and insecure, not knowing what to do. Interestingly, when the fences were put back, the kids went back to happily playing and having fun.</p>
<p>Sneaky as these experiments are, it shows that boundaries are actually an important part of understanding the freedom God wants for His children. They provide security, love and direction - things we need no matter how old we are. Ok, this all sounds good in theory, but how does it play out in the everyday?</p>
<p>It can be great and even liberating to say 'yes', but if you haven't learnt how to healthily say 'no', you can easily become <em>'like a city with broken-down walls</em>.' You'll always be putting yourself out, only to find people taking advantage. You may well end up suffering from burnout, maybe even resenting the people you love. It's often the nicest people whose heart is in the right place that end up chasing around pleasing people, rather than pursuing what God wants for them. How are your boundaries looking? Do you see yourself as the pleasing-people character heading for burnout? You can't take charge of your own life while you're overwhelmed feeling responsible for other people's lives. Set some boundaries, and live the life God gave you to live!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Matt 5:8, Ps 24:3-6, 2 Pet 3:3-14, Ps 17:15<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54150&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.' Philippians 4:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Create rigid boundaries and you'll miss out. Have no boundaries and you'll flip out. What's the solution? Flexible boundaries! The apostle Paul came to understand what this means. He was secure in His relationship with God and everything he did flowed out from what God wanted for him. '<em>I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.</em>' (Philippians 4:12-13 NLT)</p>
<p>Notice that Paul uses the word <em>learned</em> - getting to that point isn't something that happens overnight (we know it's sometimes hard to work out where God is leading!) God wants '<em>streams of living water</em>' to spring out from you, but when you're doing everything based on pleasing other people (or just what seems right to you without checking it out with God), you'll end up drier than the Sahara and emptier than a... ... ...well, a very tired empty thing.</p>
<p>There is a deep well of God's strength available to you and it's found in His Word, as you let Him disciple you daily. He'll reshape you and teach you how to cope with anything that life throws at you. So go to Him for it, and give Him space to move in your life. Let Him build boundaries in you that enable you to adjust to circumstances. Then you'll be able to practise the principle, '<em>Bear one another's burdens...</em>' (Galatians 6:2 NKJV), without over-functioning or being responsible for others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 7:18-11:27, Luke 7:11-23, Ps 118:1-9, Pr 18:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54151&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart...' Psalm 139:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Think of that mirror from <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>. The wicked queen looked into it, asked who was the fairest of them all and got a reply along the lines of, 'Know that step-daughter of yours - the one without the tan?' The one you never really liked anyway? She's way nicer looking than you. Ignore any focus on external beauty and consider the real point here: <em>Snow White was also inwardly fair</em>.</p>
<p>What about you? If you're not making any progress spiritually, it could be time for a spiritual check-up. God loves it when we're honest with Him and when we ask Him to search our hearts. It's at that point He can step in and start to work with us. He's not going to force Himself on us, though.</p>
<p>The first question asked in the Bible was: '<em>Where are you?</em>' (Genesis 3:9 NIV) Adam and Eve had not long eaten the forbidden fruit and were feeling the shame of it all. God wasn't on a fact-finding mission - He knew all along! He was simply looking for honesty. There's no point us hiding behind the fig leaves of our good actions and smiling sweetly, when beneath it all we're dying. God wants you to live happy, healthy and whole, so have the courage to book yourself in for an examination with God. Use Psalm 139 as your spiritual health-check today: read through it and take the time to let God search you and highlight any improvements that need to be made in your heart.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 12:1-14:20, Luke 7:24-35, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 18:7-9<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54152&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities...for Christ's sake...' 2 Corinthians 12:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Ever get a thought that makes you stop and say, 'Hmm, is that you, God?' Then you hear it again. By the time it comes onto your radar a third time, you just 'know in your knower' that it definitely <em>is</em> God and not just your brain stuck on one-track repeat. It was exactly the same with Paul.</p>
<p>In the middle of a tough situation, God said to Paul three times, '<em>My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.</em>' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) This is Paul - <em>the </em>Paul - learning an important lesson. He wrote loads of the New Testament and faithfully served God evangelising Europe, and the guy still talked about having a 'thorn in his flesh' - a weakness that kept coming back over and over again. We don't know exactly what he was talking about, but we do know that it drove him towards Jesus. That's the important thing.</p>
<p>But the ultimate example of power working best in weakness was Jesus was on the cross. At the same time, it's the most glorious and gracious moment in history. Jesus Himself prayed to God that if He was willing He would '<em>take this cup from [Him].</em>' (Luke 22:42 NIV) It might be a paradox, but '<em>God blesses those who are poor and realise their need for Him, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.</em>' (Matthew 5:3 NLT) Bring your 'thorns' and your weaknesses to God, and ask Him to reveal how He can use them, and your current circumstances, for His Kingdom.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 14:21-17:13, Luke 7:36-50, Ps 118:19-29, Pr 18:10-12<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54154&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bring Me an offering...' Exodus 25:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p><em>God is amazing! I'</em><em>m so excited</em><em>!! </em><em>We were praying and God gave me a word that confirms He</em><em>'s got a really exciting plan for my life!!! I just can'</em><em>t wait to see what He'</em><em>s going to do!!!!</em></p>
<p>Now while it's totally true God does have an exciting plan for your life, it's worth pointing out that He's also waiting to see what <em>you'</em><em>re</em> going to do. Whatever it is <em>you'</em><em>re</em> hoping to build - whether it's a relationship with that special someone, or a career or business - it'll require sacrifice. This train were on isn't about putting our collective feet up and expecting God to do all the hard work while we coast along.</p>
<p>God asks us to bring an offering, and that doesn't mean simply dropping money onto the plate or into the velvet bag as it passes by on Sunday. It's about <em>'offering your body as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God - this is your spiritual act of worship.</em>' (Romans 12:1 NIV) This means more than a praise party on a Sunday evening, it also means the attitude you wake up with on a Monday morning. Jesus Himself knew what it meant to offer everything to His Father when He said, '<em>It is finished</em>,' from the cross (John 19:30 NIV). Make sure you can say the same as you give your life back to God and indicate to Him, just as Jesus did, what you are willing to sacrifice.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 17:14-19:43, Luke 8:1-15, Ps 123, Pr 18:13-16<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54227&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Make everything according to the pattern I have shown you...' Exodus 25:40 NLT<br /><br /><p>In Genesis 1, when God's creating the world, His comments range from 'good' to 'very good'. 'Good' might sound bland by today's use of the word, but this is God labeling something as properly 'good' - that carries a fair bit of weight! God is holy and perfect - so, for Him, excellence is just the way things are, and He wants the same from us and for us.</p>
<p>When instructing Moses on what He wanted the tabernacle to be made out of, you can tell by the quality of materials used that only the very best interested Him. Though God smiles on excellence, it doesnt mean He's into perfectionism. Edwin Bliss puts it like this: 'The pursuit of excellence is gratifying and healthy. The pursuit of perfection is frustrating, neurotic, and a terrible waste of time.' The worst bit about it is that nobody ever 'arrives' at 'perfection' through pursuing it. It's like that dream where you're running but you never arrive at that far-off point in the horizon.</p>
<p>Excellence means always moving forward - but not stressing out if you've had a bad day as you journey with Jesus. It means not looking at how shiny and 'Christian' your mate's life looks and feeling bad about yours. That's a whole lot less pressure off you right there! Striving for excellence in our relationships with God involves spending time with Him and being open to His influence in our lives. So, if you suffer from perfectionism, make a conscious decision to give God your best and leave the rest with Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 20:1-22:30, Luke 8:16-25, Ps 133, Pr 18:17-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54228&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Go into all the world and preach...' Mark 16:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The word '<em>tabernacle'</em> basically means '<em>tent of meeting</em>' - it's worth digging around this one to see what it's about. We all know bricks and mortar don't make a house a home. Even if you bling up your church building, it's only worth looking at because it's a place to come together to worship God.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was a tent and not a permanent building because the Israelites were a people on the move. Peter says we're more like '<em>foreigners in the land</em>' (1 Peter 1:17 NLT) - when you become a Christian, your true home is God's world, and an eternity of Heaven. Think of this life now as just a prequel, your own origin story.</p>
<p>This all relies on God living in you and making His home in your heart. Dont fall into thinking the church building is the only place where God lives: Dont you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? (1 Corinthians 6:19 NLT)</p>
<p>Make sure you get this: the '<em>tabernacle</em>' is also your heart. You're in God, living-your-life-on-the-move with Him because He's in you. It's true! As you spend time with Jesus today, take advantage of the chance to welcome Him afresh and ask Him where He wants to go and who He wants to speak to through you. The last thing Jesus said to His disciples was, <em>'Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature</em>.' That's why God tabernacles in your heart: so He can reach out to others through you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 22:31-24:25, Luke 8:26-39, Ps 140, Pr 18:21-22<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54229&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you...right desires...' Ezekiel 36:26 TLB<br /><br /><p>Freedom's something we all want. God wants us to be free too - in fact, His first three words to Adam in Genesis 2:16 NIV are, '<em>You are free...</em>' So all is rosy so far, but have you blissfully switched off at that point and missed what else He's saying? If you don't hear the rest of the conversation, you'll miss the proviso that comes next. The next verse says, '<em>...but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.</em>'</p>
<p>Paul sheds more light on the whole issue of freedom in Galatians 5. At no point does he say that freedom means doing what you want, when you want, how you want. He shows us that sin is actually the opposite of freedom, where we keep on craving what's bad for us, wanting more and more until we die, whether that's in a spiritual, emotional or physical sense.</p>
<p>It's a paradox that goes against what the world considers to be freedom, but true freedom is actually found in self-control. The ancient philosopher Aristotle said that self-control was about 'feeling the right amount of pleasure at the right things to the right degree.' Too much pleasure is obvious to spot, like when you need to loosen your belt after gulping half a cheesecake. However pleasure in the wrong things sometimes requires more discernment. You need the Holy Spirit to help you decide between right and wrong in the choices facing you. With God's help, you can develop self-control, so that you will find more of the true freedom He wants you to experience.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Matt 5:9, Rom 12:17-21, James 3:17-18, 2 Ki 6:8-23<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54230&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[' In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.' Proverbs 16:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Going on a never-ending spiritual retreat to discover God's will for you might sound like a good idea, but there comes a point where you've got to start doing what He asks you to do. There's nothing wrong with making plans - after all, '<em>who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there is enough money to finish it?</em>' (Luke 14:28 NLT) But you can't steer a stationary ship. The reality is that sometimes God's got a different (and always better, btw) plan for us.</p>
<p>God created us and wants us to go to Him with our requests and our plans and ask Him what He has to say, not just go steamrolling into a situation 'just because we can'. When everything you touch seems to be turning to gold (like you're walking on a cloud of marshmallows and a flock of bluebirds do your hair every morning and bring you breakfast in bed), self-confidence can easily creep in. So be careful: '<em>...you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, &quot;If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.&quot;</em>' (James 4:14-15 NIV) You may not always look where you're going, but you will always end up going where you're looking! David changed his perspective and prayed, '<em>My eyes are fixed on You...Lord...</em>' (Psalm 141:8 NIV) You should pray that too.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Pet 1-3, Luke 8:40-56, Ps 146, Pr 18:23-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54232&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Call to Me and I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you feel lost in unfamiliar territory, uncertain as to what your next move should be? God uses such times to get your attention, call you back to Himself and encourage you to lean on Him. The disciples were in this situation: a storm was lashing at their boat and it was so bad that, although they'd been through heaps of gales, they genuinely feared for their lives. Two of the disciples were sent to the lower deck where Jesus was sleeping. '<em>Teacher, don't you care that we're going to drown?</em>'</p>
<p>Jesus coolly responds by calming the storm in one sentence, then asking two questions. (Go find it all in Mark 4:35-41. We'll be right here when you get back). The first question was about fear and the second about faith.</p>
<p>The disciples learned through this storm something about who Jesus was. The storms you go through can be used for good, too, driving you closer to God. Jesus' questions to His disciples (<em>Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?</em>) also show they hadn't grasped who was in control of the situation.</p>
<p>If God has pointed you in a particular direction, and you've obediently set off but stuff's just not happening, hold back on the complaining. It may be that part of your journey includes learning some lessons. Remember who He is and rest in the fact God knows what He's doing. As long as your hope is in anything other than God's unfailing love and goodness, you'll wrestle with uncertainty. What's the answer?

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord, who heals you.' Exodus 15:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>Perhaps you think God leaves the business of healing to doctors and hospitals these days. But wait. In the Bible, one of the names God chooses to be called by is <em>Jehovah Rapha</em>, which means 'I am the Lord who heals.' God also says, '<em>...I am the Lord All-Powerful, and I never change</em>.' (Malachi 3:6 CEV) And Jesus, who is God, is '<em>...the same yesterday and today and forever</em>.' (Hebrews 13:8 NIV) What He was, He still is. What He did, He still does.</p>
<p>So, when you or a loved one is sick, bear in mind that God, our loving Father, still heals today. If, however, you're praying your guts out and not seeing anything happening, it's not that you're doing anything wrong. The question of why our good God let bad things happen is thousands of years old - an entire book of the Bible, the Book of Job, is dedicated to it. It seems that God sometimes lets things happen for reasons hidden from us - but He makes us a promise: all things work together for good for those who love Him. He is still God and His love for us is constant.</p>
<p>So. What's our part in the healing process? Give it to God. This doesn't mean just 'stop worrying', but actually deciding to trust Him to move. Jesus gives us guidance about how to pray: '<em>...All things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.</em>' (Mark 11:24 NAS) When your prayer is lined up with God's will, healing is part of His gift of salvation to you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 10:1-12:22, Luke 12:22-34, Ps 119:25-32, Pr 20:25-27<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55926&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have learned how to be content with whatever I have.' Philippians 4:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>'<em>This too shall pass</em>' is a great motto. If you're on top of the world, it keeps you grounded. If you're as low as you can go, it's a good way to remember that things won't always look as dark as they do now.</p>
<p>We often find ourselves reminiscing about the good times looking back on the happiest times of our lives. You might be wishing you were back home and not at uni/school/your job or vice versa. Maybe it's something that you're looking forward to just waiting <em>until</em> something happens. Do your prayers just consist of: 'God, please get me out of here?'</p>
<p>While imprisoned, Paul had a strange and deep gratitude. Consider that for a second: back then, prisons were more like sewers and Paul was in there simply for preaching the Gospel. In spite of this, he was actually <em>thankful.</em> From his cell, just before he wrote the amazing words above, he didn't moan about being in the slammer. Instead he wrote, '<em>Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done. Then you'll experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your heart and mind as you live in Christ Jesus.</em>' (Philippians 4:6-7 NLT) When you really seek God and His will for your life, God Himself will be your great reward. Everything else is just a bonus. In what area of your life do you need God's peace? He might change the situation, but your attitude might be the thing that needs to change.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hab 1-3, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 65, Pr 19:5-8<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54560&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['It is [God] who gives you the ability to produce wealth.' Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Money. There are a bunch of songs we could quote to emphasise the subject, but consider yourself spared today. Whether finances float your boat or not, you'll be aware that money matters. Jesus spoke about money more than He did about Heaven and hell combined, and in fact more than anything else except the Kingdom of God. The reality is that despite all the references to money in the Bible we often find it a tricky topic to talk about: <em>Is wealth bad? How much should you give away? Is wealth a sign of God'</em><em>s blessing? Do we act in faith first and trust the funds will follow, or is that trying to force God'</em><em>s hand?</em> These aren't easy questions with straightforward answers.</p>
<p>But maybe there are deeper reasons Jesus talks about money because of what money can reveal about us. Surprisingly, those parables weren't really to do with earthly investments. He was using them to ask us what we value. Do we really need possessions to feel good about ourselves? Can we be ok with not fitting in? Who or what do we really rely on? What's our definition of treasure?</p>
<p>Maybe the solution to our actual money stresses is a bit less spiritual, a lot more practical and is summed up by the word 'discipline'. Consider Paul's advice: '<em>I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.</em>' (Philippians 4:12-13 NLT)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Tim 4-6, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 19:12-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54561&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am the Lord... who teaches you to profit...' Isaiah 48:17 NAS<br /><br /><p>One of God's names is 'Jehovah Jireh' which basically means 'God will provide'. God's provision for you includes your brain and body. For most of us, it also includes the energy to go out and put in a shift at work. Up until the age of 30, Jesus Himself would have been a fully-fledged carpenter under the guidance of His earthly father, learning a trade and learning the (many) benefits of a hard day's work.</p>
<p>'Living to work' shouldn't ever be a lifestyle for a Christian, though God's provision means that we won't ever have orient our entire lives around employment, careers or the rat race. There might be a few cliches youve heard about God's provision, but some of them have lasted because they're true. 'Where God leads, God feeds!' reminds us that if were living for Him as a priority, all the secondary stuff, like finances, will fall into place. And just because God's provision might come through in a way we don't expect, scheduled and regular, that doesn't mean that it isn't His provision. Just say thanks!</p>
<p>You may want your financial provision to be nice and tidy, like uncooked spaghetti (bear with us for this metaphor) dropping straight from your employer's bank account to yours. But often it's more like cooked spaghetti, with a lot less pattern and predictability. Instead of asking what God's doing, ask yourself what you're doing. God will keep providing and in the process He'll be smiling as you put your faith in Him. One last cliche: when you've done your best, you've got to trust God with the rest.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Tim 4-6, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 19:12-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54563&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... He has commanded us to love one another...'  2 John 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>No-one wants to be on their own 24/7; we all crave company. In fact God made us to live in community. This means you possess something priceless to offer people - your time. Giving people your attention and your company is the best way of letting them know you value them - we all need to be appreciated!</p>
<p>Jesus says this should be a no-questions-asked priority in our lives: '<em>...He has commanded us to love one another...</em>' If obeyed, this command will have an astonishing effect on us. Jesus said: '<em>Give and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.</em>' (Luke 6:38 NLT)</p>
<p>No excuses or procrastination: the best time to express your love is <em>now</em>! Why? Because no-one, but God, knows how long we have left here on earth. Sadly not all of us will live to a 'ripe old age'. Circumstances change; so use every opportunity to 'love one another' while it's still possible. Live a life of love, not one of regrets. The best use of life is love, the best expression of love is time, and the best time to love is now. Think about all your family and friends. Make plans today; get dates in your diary to spend quality time with those who youve been neglecting. Decide to live a life of love.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zeph 1-3, Luke 9:46-56, Ps 42:6-11, Pr 19:15-17<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54564&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['For we walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NAS<br /><br /><p>Ever spent time searching for God on Twitter? Hunted in vain for His Facebook profile? Trying to get the lowdown on exactly what God is like, to know everything about Him? You don't just 'google' the Almighty...</p>
<p>We'll get frustrated if we ask God to hand us everything we want to know about Him, His plans, and our lives on a silver platter. That magic, wish-fulfilment god is not the one in the Bible - in fact, one prophet in the Bible went so far as to say: '<em>Truly, You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</em>' (Isaiah 45:15 ESV) No wonder many people get annoyed when they try to find God and only discover silence - they've searched for evidence, facts and data; their approach has been more like trying to excavate an object than find a Person.</p>
<p>God wants us to engage with Him, and wants His family to be people who seek Him. It's not about knowing dry, lifeless facts about Him. Learning to walk by faith means bridging the gap between what we see and what we can't see - not with knowledge, not with thoughts, not even with understanding: but simply by wanting God. Wanting God with your whole being - your mind, body, and spirit. A little prayer of 'Yes' to God to want Him above everything else, will result in so much more than anything the world can offer. Decide, right now, to make all your tomorrows a walk of faith. Invite Him into everything you do, at every step, and seek His leadership for your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Matt 5:10, 1 Thess 2:13-3:5, 1 Cor 4:11-13, Rev 6:9-11<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54565&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!' Mark 9:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>'<em>We walk by faith and not by sight</em>.' Whether you sing songs about faith, say a hearty 'Amen!' to other people's prayers about it, or agree to it in theory, what is really meant by it? What does 'walking by sight' mean, anyway, and what's so wrong about it? Well, it's about guidance, and what - or who - we use as our GPS.</p>
<p>You're less likely to question God's guidance when things are awesome. You feel amazing and the world recognises what a master basket-weaver you are. However when the rain's pouring down and the storms of life are getting wilder, then we can meet the enemy of faith: commonly known as <em>doubt</em>. Then God's guidance becomes easier to question. Faith needs to kick in at the point where our natural instincts, thoughts and feelings come up against difficulties in relationships/health/stress/fill-in-the-blank.</p>
<p>In Mark 9:23, we read of a dad who had the same dilemma. He knew the power of God from the past, but his current circumstances made him question all of that as he started to trust what he could see: his little boy foaming at the mouth in pain. It was only when he was honest: '<em>I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief</em>' (Mark 9:24 NLT) that Jesus came through for him.</p>
<p>Is there something coming up that you're dreading? Be honest with God as you pray - trust that He knows exactly how you feel about it, but more than that, also has it under control.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 1-2, Luke 9:57-62, Ps 46, Pr 19:18-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54567&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Open my eyes, that I may see...' Psalm 119:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Astronomers think the centre of the Milky Way is home to a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. If it's there and on schedule, it'll be devouring a colossal gas cloud as you read this issue of <strong><em>word4U2day</em></strong>. Then it'll spend the rest of its life snacking on our galaxy's space debris and asteroids, hungrily swallowing anything that comes near.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the most comforting thought, is it? How much more reassuring is it to be a Christian with an insight into a deeper reality - knowing the centre of our universe is a Person, not a thing! The centre is a strong and kind Creator with our best interests in mind, and a good plan for humanity. It's true! The warm heart of reality is a Creator longing for relationship with His creation.</p>
<p>But often we don't act like this is for real. We don't live like it's true for those around us. And we don't live like it's true for us, at the core of our beings. The way some days go, there may as well be a hungry black hole at the centre of our lives. Do your eyes need to be opened? Are you just 'getting by' from day to day? Do you order your life in the light of the fact there is an active, powerful God working in you and those around you? Perhaps you've let that fact grow stale. Well, today is the day to start seeing things as they really are again. Ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes so you can see the whole picture.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 9-10, Luke 10:25-37, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 19:27-29<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54712&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[I Believe in Angels...?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[i-believe-in-angels]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Some people have welcomed angels as guests, without even knowing it.' Hebrews 13:2 CEV<br /><br /><p>Sceptics tend to think the Christian belief in God is weird. And those baby cherubs and sweet-looking angels are just tacked-on religious sentiment. Well, don't let your mind neutralise your faith, just because a few artists got carried away with some pretty faces. Angels are majestic enough to inspire fear. (They often start conversations with: 'Don't be afraid.') An angel shut the mouths of lions for Daniel (see Daniel 6:22). An angel opened prison doors for Peter, saving him from execution (Acts 12:7). An angel showed up in a storm to let Paul know that he'd survive a shipwreck (Acts 27:23).</p>
<p>Angels aren't entertaining sidekicks in a Bible episode, they're part of God's real-world promise for your life. <em>'For He will order His angels to protect you wherever you go</em>.' (Psalm 91:11 NLT) A team of divine servants of God have been sent to assist us as we walk with God. '<em>Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</em>' (Hebrews 1:14 NIV) They're part of God's promise for your everyday life. God's secret service is on the case! They're not sitting on their hands claiming a Jobseeker Allowance somewhere in Heaven, but out on active duty. Now, they're extremely clear they don't want us to pay much attention to them - as any good servant does, they'd rather point to their Master. They want God to get the glory. Isn't it encouraging to know God is with us and His angels surround us every day to help us in times of danger.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Jn 1:1-3:10, Luke 10:38-42, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 20:1-3<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54713&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If we have enough...let us be content.' 1 Timothy 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>'If only I...' This simple phrase, repeated regularly, holds the key to lasting discontent. No matter how good your life is now, no matter how God has blessed you in the past, 'If only I...' brings it all crashing down, making you feel like you've got nothing worth having.</p>
<p>Paul had this all sorted. He said, '<em>I have learned how to be content with whatever I have</em>.' (Philippians 4:11 NLT) And Ben Franklin agreed, writing: 'Contentment makes poor men rich, and discontent makes rich men poor.'</p>
<p>Contentment is found by leaning on your Creator. Your Father knows what you need, and He will provide for you - if you lean on Him. So how does contentment come about? First, <em>seek Him.</em> Make it a daily choice. We really need to come to the place where we know that having more materially won't make us happier. The only permanent fix for this is to replace our desire for more stuff with a desire for more of God. Often this means simplifying your life, stripping away unnecessary things. Then<em>, say it.</em> Say, 'I have enough' every time that you're faced with the temptation to say 'If only I...'</p>
<p>Focus on eternity and let enough be enough. Whenever you are about to buy something new, ask God: 'Lord, how can I use this for you?' Lastly, <em>settle it</em>. Don't set your heart on any other riches than that of the knowledge and love of God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Jn 3:11-5:21, Luke 11:1-13, Ps 78:40-55, Pr 20:4-6<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54715&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['What do you think about...Christ?' Matthew 22:42 NKJ<br /><br /><p>One day Jesus took Peter, James and John to the top of a mountain. And there Jesus began to glow with dazzling light and two famous people from Jewish history suddenly popped into view. 'Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus... Peter...blurted out, &quot;Master...Let's make three shelters as memorials - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot;' (Luke 9:3033 NLT)</p>
<p>You might have expected Peter to come out with something like this. He wanted to honour the miraculous appearance of Moses and Elijah - giants of the faith and heroes of history - and give them the respect due to them. From his point of view, their discussion with Jesus meant that the three most significant champions in the entire history of the world were in the same spot together. No wonder he came across all tongue-tied.</p>
<p>But his thinking was wrong. This was the moment Peter and the other disciples started to learn just how different and high-above-all Jesus is. Three memorials would have made Moses and Elijah equal with Jesus. Right then, Jesus started to lift the veil on the truth - He is wholly, solely, thoroughly and altogether God, and that first place belongs to no-one else. The penny dropped for the disciples. Has it dropped for you yet? On that mountaintop, God said, '<em>This is My Son, whom I have chosen; listen to Him.</em>' (Luke 9:35 NIV) Are you listening to Him and Him alone? If He isn't yet the Lord of all your life, perhaps it's time to make that decision.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jn 1:1-14, Matt 4:12-16, Matt 5:14-16, Acts 9:1-19<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54716&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are My servant; I have chosen you.' Isaiah 41:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Fully grown elephants can grow to weigh over five tonnes. How on earth did circus trainers in the old days keep them smashing through every fence and escaping? The answer was not by building a stronger cage but by controlling its thinking - they would begin with the baby elephant and tie it to a wooden post secured in the ground. Because it was not yet very strong, it was unable to pull out the post. It would try and try but never succeed. And before too long it would give up trying. The elephant grew older and stronger but its thinking was locked tight. 'Elephants never forget' is a famous saying and it's pretty accurate. The elephant continued to believe that whenever it was tied to a post, it couldn't get away.</p>
<p>People are not much different. Things we were told or taught when we were very young can continue to hold us back and keep us tied to one spot. Many of us have been told we'll never amount to much - someone has sneered that we haven't got what it takes to go to uni, follow our dreams or succeed in reaching a longedfor goal. So we never really try. Or we're become convinced we're not worth anyone's time or love. Overcoming this 'post' is not impossible! Believe God. Trust Him. He says: 'You are My servant; <em>I have </em><em>chosen you</em>...do not fear, for <em>I am with you</em>...<em>I will strengthen you and help you.</em>' (Isaiah 41:910 NIV)</p>
<p>So pray that God, who has chosen and committed Himself to you, will break any unwanted ropes and wooden posts holding you back from the life He wants for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 1-2, Luke 11:14-28, Ps 78:56-64, Pr 20:7-10<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54718&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[proud-of-your-parents]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Parents are the pride of their children.' Proverbs 17:6 NIV<br /><br /><p><em>Come again?</em> Yep.<em> </em>Today, we're zoning in on the Biblical idea that children should honour their parents. Families are important to God. God can use any family member to bless, teach or correct any other.</p>
<p>If you ever end up with children of your own, you'll realise how challenging it can be to be a parent. It starts off with a shock as normal life is interrupted by an insatiable infant and months of broken sleep. Then it gets worse! Instilling strong values and good character into kids, tweens and teens isn't easy. It's a daily challenge to lay out firm boundaries while assuring them they are loved. Building character and encouraging them to go for all God has in store for them means being constantly alert. In short: it's hard work.</p>
<p>It's important to honour your parents - those who mothered and fathered you. God blesses us for it. (Ephesians 6:2) Perhaps you should honour them through thanks, or perhaps through forgiveness. Most often it's both! Some of us have had a really hard time with mum or dad. If your parents weren't the role models God asked them to be, or hurt you some way, leave room for God to deal with them by leaving your anger and bitterness in His hands. If you can, try to see the best in them today, not excusing them but forgiving them. Excusing lets them off the hook but forgiving lets you off! How can you honour your parents in a special way today? Write a letter, make a call, send a text. Tell them (or whoever has helped to raise you well) that you're really thankful for who they are and what they do for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 7:20-9:44, Luke 12:13-21, Ps 119:17-24, Pr 20:22-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55925&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Fear's Foothold]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[fears-foothold]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not fear, for I am with you.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>The words 'fear not', 'do not fear' or 'do not be afraid' appear hundreds of times in the Bible, all the way from Genesis to Revelation. Why is that? Because God knows fear can be such a huge part of human life, and how easily we can move from fearless to fearful.</p>
<p>As babies, we didn't know what fear was. But when we learned after a few bumps and tumbles, some of us never recovered. Fear has stuck with us since. It's a constant companion God wants us to send away permanently.</p>
<p>Don't let fear keep you inside your comfort zone and minimise what God's done for you. Don't let fear steal the freedom you have in Christ. The good news is, if you're living in Him, fear will never be able to get a proper foothold! It may try to sneak its toe in the door but, if you let the knowledge God cares for you sink in, it enables Him to unhook fear's toehold, slam the door on it and also set you free.</p>
<p>You can live fearlessly. That doesn't mean you'll never be afraid, simply that you won't let fear control the way you think and act. Some fear is good - but when caution keeps us in check, never ever taking a risk, then our lives are really shaped by a worry about what will happen if we take that risk. The negative thoughts and unexamined anxieties keeping you behind bars are faulty feelings God wants to remove from your life. Let Him do that today. Remember: '<em>Do not fear, for I am with you</em>.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 3:1-4:23, Luke 11:29-44, Ps 78:65-72, Pr 20:11-14<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55922&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will uphold you with My...right hand.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>What right do we have <em>not</em> to fear? When the rest of the world quakes in its boots at the latest financial crash or pandemic, and friends grumble through another personal crisis, what makes us so different? What's your get-out-of-fear-free card?</p>
<p>You have a reason not to fear. And it is very simply this: the presence of your Father. A Father who thinks of you dearly, and counts you as one of His own protected children. Through thick and thin, ebb and flow, illness and health, you have the companionship and care of the universe's greatest 'Wingman'. You can lie in a hospital bed and, even there, praise the God who heals. You can draw on strength, especially when you feel weak, withered and battered down inside. You can resist the enemy even when you feel defeated - remember, God commanded the Israelites to fight huge nations and armies with just a handful of warriors. Why? Because God's greater strength would win the day (see Deuteronomy 20:19), but any large army full of fearful hearts would hold back from His awesome seeminglyimpossible destiny for them. '<em>...Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.</em>' (Deuteronomy 20:8 NIV) God knows that when you allow fear to rule your heart, it's fatal, not only for you, but to those around you.</p>
<p>Let today be the day you lift your head and raise your hopes. Go out and share your confidence, knowing '<em>the Lord your God...will be with you.</em>'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 4:24-5:26, Luke 11:45-54, Ps 119:1-8, Pr 20:15-18<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55923&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you are tempted, He will...provide a way out.' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV <br /><br /><p>The Bible makes no promise of total freedom from temptation. But if you are faithful to God, He promises there will always be an EXIT sign leading away from the sin you're considering. '<em>The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful...He will show you a way out so...you can endure</em>.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT)</p>
<p>God will always provide a way out for His beloved children, but that means we have to choose to take it. And it <em>doesn</em><em>'</em><em>t </em>mean we have a licence to keep going back. Think of the finale of <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>! (*Mahoosive Spoiler Alert*) Indy's love interest has just toppled into a chasm which opened up when she tried to remove the Holy Grail from its temple. Indy grabs her hand to stop her falling into the abyss. Then she spots the Grail resting on a ledge just within reach. Moments away from rescue, she chooses to grasp towards the treasure... and loses her grip on Indy's hand.</p>
<p>If your Saviour's pulling you out of some compromising situation you've got into, stay very close to Him! Don't lose your grip on your His hand. And - don't try to reach for some forbidden fruit on the way out. It might hurt, it might not be what you want, but it is absolutely for your best. If you're faithful to God, you've no reason to be scared of temptation. When it shows up, look for the promised EXIT sign and take it, boldly.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 6:1-7:19, Luke 12:1-12, Ps 119:9-16, Pr 20:19-21<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55924&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Speaking the truth in love...' Ephesians 4:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p><em>Your loose-</em><em>tongued best friend has spent the last ten minutes laying out every bit of dirt on the love life of someone you both know. It was embarrassing, hilarious, and just a little bit malicious. This isn</em><em>'</em><em>t the first time it</em><em>'</em><em>s happened</em><em>, and the gossip is starting to leave an ugly taste in your mouth...</em></p>
<p>Over to you. Is it time to wade in, or hold off?</p>
<p><em>Your mate</em><em>'</em><em>s unlimited broadband means he</em><em>'</em><em>s getting the newest films in the comfort of his bedroom before they</em><em>'</em><em>re even showing at the cinema. Not to mention any music his iPod desires. All without paying a cent. Even though he says it</em><em>'</em><em>s not hurting anyone, your conscience is beginning to differ...</em></p>
<p>And back to you. Is it time to wade in, or hold off?</p>
<p>We need to be careful to choose the right time to do this, but sometimes loving someone requires confronting them for their own good. If it involves a destructive habit, something that's illegal or a situation that could hurt them, it's important not to turn a blind eye. The Bible offers amazing wisdom on how to tackle this.</p>
<p>Here are two examples: (1) 'Love is not rude.' It doesn't use an aggressive, heavy-handed approach. What is said is spoken with kindness. (2) 'Love is not self-seeking.' It forgets about needing to be accepted and liked, or to score 'holy points' off the other person. Instead it makes sure their wellbeing is the main priority. If you're in this sort of situation today, pray for God's Holy Spirit to speak through you with wisdom and tact, so that the truth comes out in love.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exodus 16:1-18, John 6:1-15, John 6:25-40, 1 Cor 11:23-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55927&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens...' Isaiah 40:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>Where do you stand on the debate? Some of the world's finest minds are determined to persuade you the planet you live on, the body you inhabit, the brain you are using to understand this sentence, were all just happy accidents. That you, me, all of us are just the product of a moment in time that went very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very well. Oops! Our mistake! We underestimated those <em>very</em>'s by a hundred or so.</p>
<p>The Bible couldn't be more clear that the universe itself is not a mistake. Neither is it the result of accident nor blind chance. It's the work of a very purposeful Creator: '<em>Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.</em>'</p>
<p>Now, surprising as this may be, the particular copy of <em>word4U2day</em> you happen to be holding was not the result of an explosion in a printing press (or a server somewhere, internet friends). No, if there's a book, then there must be a publisher. If there's a building, there must be an architect and builder. If there's a work of art, there must be an artist. If there's a website, there must be a designer.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Waiting for a Relationship?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[waiting-for-a-relationship]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...we belong to each other.' Ephesians 4:25 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Right at the beginning of the Bible, we read, 'And God saw that it was good.' Then there comes a 'not good.' 'The Lord God said, 'It is <i>not good</i> for the man <i>to be alone...</i>' (Genesis 2:18 NIV) Yep, God has made us for relationship and He says such companionship is 'good'.</p>
<p>What about those of us who are still waiting for a relationship? Three wise things to do: (1) <i>Be the kind of partner you seek:</i> dedicated to God; pursuing wisdom; generous; hopeful. Like attracts like. (2)<i> Reach out to others.</i> 'Do not be interested only in your own life...be interested in...others.' (Philippians 2:4 NCV) There are no perfect relationships, or risk-free ones. You can guard your heart, and at the same time see what people need and strive to bless them. Blessing others eventually brings blessings back! And (3) <i>Pray for your future partner. </i>Even if you haven't met him or her yet. Pray that God will bring His good things into their lives - including you.</p>
<p>Finally, an important note! Some of us are given a different calling - set aside for special use, which means God's plan for us doesn't include marriage or a mate. It's not always easy, but there are some pretty powerful examples of faithful unmarried servants of God. Paul's a bit of a legend, (1 Corinthians 7:1-10), and he certainly shows that we don't need to be married to be powerful for God! Whatever your future holds, if it's in God, you'll know Love.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...' Matthew 5:6 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>What are you hungry for? What do you thirst for? Jesus says that if you're hungry for the right things, for righteousness itself, then you'll be filled. He is promising that the bad stuff of the world-as-we-know-it is going to be sorted out. And in the meantime, if what propels you through life is righteousness, and if you know God - who is righteousness and floods every place where He's honoured with it - well then, how supremely happy you are!</p>
<p>In John 4, Jesus came across a woman at a well who wanted to satisfy her deepest desires (she had married five times!) but was constantly left dissatisfied. Jesus used the situation to highlight her need for real satisfaction. It's the same offer He makes to us today. You were made for Him, and nothing else in life will satisfy like He will.</p>
<p>Satan loves to whisper in our ear that we won't be satisfied until we've got the qualification, the love of our life, the job, the house, the car. The truth is that Jesus is enough. Our righteousness is actually found in Jesus, walking as He walked. When we live in His power, we can live so much higher than our sense of not-good-enough-ness. That's what it means when it says in John 1:17 NAS, '<em>For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realised through Jesus Christ.</em>' With the help of the Spirit of the Lord, your attitudes and behaviours can change. When you hunger and thirst for righteousness, you become more and more like Jesus.</p>

Up to seven times?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times</em>.&quot;' (Matthew 18:21-22 NIV) This statement is quite sobering, especially when people may have hurt us really badly, many times! The point Jesus was trying to drive home is that it's vital to forgive. Just after Jesus taught His disciples how to pray by giving them the Lord's Prayer (read it for yourself in Matthew 6:9-13). He clearly states that '<em>if you refuse to forgive others, your [heavenly] Father will not forgive your sins</em>.' (Matthew 6:15 NLT) If you find giving grace to those who 'trespass against you' easy, then how supremely happy you are. If you don't, you've just found something to pray for God to give you!</p>
<p>Why is 'being merciful' such a big deal? Well, it's not just about receiving forgiveness from God, but also about the state you've got into. Lewis B. Smedes says, 'When you release the wrongdoer from the wrong, you cut a malignant tumour out of your inner life. You set a prisoner free, but you discover that the real prisoner was yourself.'</p>
<p>You're not torturing the wrongdoer when you hold back forgiveness, but yourself. Is there anyone who has wronged you and hasn't apologised, but you know you still need to forgive? Release them and be blessed. God has promised you justice, so leave it in His hands. In fact, the only people you should consider getting even with are those who've helped you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are the pure in heart...' Matthew 5:8 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>If you went to the doctor and were told you had coronary heart disease, you'd want to do something about it, fast. The root of the problem could be high cholesterol from a bad diet, or a lack of exercise, or years of neglecting your health. Well, spiritually, we can be just the same. Do you need a health check? Does your spiritual diet consist of the odd binge followed by weeks of starvation? Or are you just going through the motions, but not actually pushing yourself and getting any fitter?</p>
<p>You'd think we'd come up with a different story by now, but guess what? Yup, it's <em>all about relationship</em>. If your heart is pure, if you have nothing in your spiritual life coming between you and the King of Righteousness, then how blessed you are! Today's verse finishes with '<em>...for they will see God.'</em> (Matthew 5:8 NIV) Want to see Him? To actually meet Him? Pray for a right heart as soon as possible!</p>
<p>How do you react when you're feeling the pressure? What's your response when you're criticised or ignored? Are you still harbouring a grudge from weeks ago?</p>
<p>The answer to these kinds of questions will indicate where you're really at. Anyone can play a part at church for a couple of hours on Sunday, but God's interested in the other 166 hours of the week. When your heart is purified, your eyes will be clear to see God in all sorts of people, places and situations. So spend some time worshipping God, just simply to be with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are the peacemakers...' Matthew 5:9 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Albert Einstein won the Nobel Peace Prize for physics in 1921 and was clearly a very clever guy. In one of his lectures in 1948, he commented on the threat of nuclear warfare: 'It is not a physical problem, but an ethical one. What terrifies us is not the explosive force of the atomic bomb, but the power of the wickedness of the human heart - it's explosive power for evil!'</p>
<p>We all want peace. So why do countries wage war on each other, why do families break down, why can't we seem to love our neighbour as ourselves, just like Jesus so simply commanded? Einstein nailed it when he talked about the wickedness of our hearts. The reality is that our hearts are selfish and, out of that sinful heart, flows all sorts of evil. And that's what causes the wars that rage within ourselves. Do you know someone who seems to be amazingly gifted in bringing peace to arguments? How supremely happy it is to be that person! They seem to carry God's presence with them wherever they go! '<em>...for they will be called sons of God.</em>'</p>
<p>Just as nuclear weapons will wreak destruction in the wrong hands, our tongues too can be used as weapons of war, whether it's shooting down peoples reputations with a sarcastic response, or spreading gossip behind their backs. Instead, we can be peacemaker in our everyday lives and see God transform our surroundingSoulFood: 1 Sam 24–26, Luke 5:27–39, Ps 110, Pr 17:15–17</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake...' Matthew 5:10 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>The final Beatitude! And here, at the end of it all, Jesus is saying it's a good thing when you get a hard time for doing the right thing?! Doesn't really sound like a great incentive, does it? But that's the topsy-turvy right-side-up Kingdom Jesus came to establish that goes in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. The life that Jesus lived was all about doing the right thing despite the (considerable) cost. Just look at the cross. Are you getting a hard time at school/uni/work, or anywhere, for being a Christian? Then you're walking the same path Jesus walked.</p>
<p>If you <em>are </em>getting shot at by the arrows of the enemy, if times are hard because others think your faith is nonsense: <em>you are blessed</em>. You. Are. Blessed. How supremely happy it is to be you! No, really! Jesus is standing right next to you and promising you His Kingdom, forever, and for right now.</p>
<p>At the centre of all of Jesus' teaching while He was up the side of this mountain was '<em>taking up your cross daily</em>', which meant dying to yourself and choosing the right thing. A great reward awaits you if you do. Without God's power in our lives, these Beatitudes can seem too awkward and costly to weave into the fabric of our every day. But He will be faithful if you ask Him for the power, mercy and grace to make the Beatitudes a reality in your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are the gentle...' Matthew 5:5 NAS<br /><br /></p>
<p>Being gentle doesn't mean being weak. When you were a baby, your parents' arms were the strongest things you knew, but they never squeezed you anywhere near as hard as they could. They weren't weak, they were <em>gentle</em>. Gentleness isn't about the amount of strength you have; it's the amount of strength you <em>use</em>. We're talking about power under restraint.</p>
<p>In <em>Back to the Future</em>, it takes Marty McFly three whole films to understand this. He learns that punching someone's lights out when someone calls him 'chicken' doesn't do anyone any favours. Punching someone's lights out, either with your fists or with your words, is the weak option. The reality of living in an imperfect world means that most of us need to choose gentleness on a regular basis. For those who find it easy to be gentle to people how 'supremely happy' it is to be you!</p>
<p>Meekness can be summarised by three S's: <strong>s</strong>ensitivity, <strong>s</strong>urrender and <strong>s</strong>ubmission. It's about being sensitive to God and to other people to make sure were not just a freight train smashing through people's lives. It's about surrendering and letting go of our own bad ways, thoughts and habits and instead choosing to go God's better way. And it's about accepting God's bigger picture, and embracing the fact that you're not the star of the show.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are those who mourn...' Matthew 5:4 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Life's full of difficult questions and perplexing circumstances and we're often left with 'whys', 'what ifs' and 'maybes'. Sometimes, the paracetamol of a quick prayer in a ministry time isn't enough to ease the pain of the grief we can feel when, for instance, we've suffered the loss of a close relative. The loss of a dream, or even a closed door, can be difficult too. So why is Jesus saying that <em>you'</em><em>re blessed when you mourn</em>? That doesn't sound quite right!</p>
<p>A tough lesson God wants us to learn is for Him to be our everything. Job and Joseph are examples of people who suffered massive loss, but came through it all, and still recognised God as Number One. Job 22:23 NLT says: '<em>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored...</em>' God will not only heal you but teach you valuable lessons through it. Even though its a painful road to walk down, '<em>weeping may go on all night but in the morning there is joy</em>.' (Psalm 30:5 NLT)</p>
<p>God is <em>not</em> saying He wanted your loss. He is saying that if you're in that place, you're not alone in the darkness, He is with you. He is the most experienced, most loving, most perfect comforter ever, and in that place of deepest darkness you may find yourself closer to Him than at any other time in your life. <em>'Blessed</em> are those who mourn, for they <em>shall</em> be <em>comforted</em>.' If you feel like you're in the tears of the night, turn to God, and trust that His peace is on its way in the morning.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Bearing with one another...' Colossians 3:13 NAS<br /><br /></p>
<p>Buy one of the clothing bargains from the sale rail that turns out to be bad quality and you're likely to find there's a clause in the purchase - no refunds. Why not? Because you bought it 'as is'. It's like that with us. God loved us 'as is', came to us when we were at our worst, and didn't turn back. And He bears with us now, even though He sees the darkest pit of thoughts in our heads.</p>
<p>How can He be so patient? Leslie Weatherfield wrote, 'Another strange thing about Jesus. He has the power to see below the surface into the very depths of the heart. He sees the seeds of lovely flowers where others see only the ugly brown soil that hides them. It is not so true to say that He loves the unlovable as to say that in every one He sees something lovable.' If He's put His spirit in you, then He won't abandon what He's started.</p>
<p>What about our attitude to other Christians? Even (especially) the less-than-lovable types? Is it our aim to fix others, or wait for them to start behaving the way we want? If someone does wrong to us, do we avoid them and write them off? That's not God's attitude. Jesus reminds you should love (yep, he said <em>love</em>) them 'as is'. The Colossian church was told to, '<em>Get along with each other, and forgive each other. If someone does wrong to you, forgive that person.</em>' (Colossians 3:13 NCV) Next time you find yourself thinking negatively of someone, start to look for the good in them that Jesus sees.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Loose him, and let him go.' John 11:44 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>We love coming back to the story of Lazarus because it's such a great model of what Jesus does to bring us new life. Today is the first day of the rest of your life, so to speak, a time to leave the disappointments and hurts of the past in the past. Let this story stay with you as you cross from one stage of life to another.</p>
<p>Covered in embalming fluid and draped in linen, Lazarus stumbles out of the tomb and finds himself in daylight. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, '<em>If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new</em>.' We leave behind the murky tomb of sin where we've been buried, and breathe fresh air, new life. We have the choice to write off our history as God already has and start again with a clean slate.</p>
<p>Notice Jesus has to tell the disciples to '<em>loose [Lazarus], and let him go</em>' because the grave clothes dont just fall off him the minute Jesus speaks to him. The principle here is that Christ has made you alive from the inside out. Jesus has made you a new creation from the inside now it is your turn to loose yourself of the things that will trip you and stop you from walking. So stop and think. Identify what has tripped you up: negative influences and thought patterns, low self-esteem, old habits, destructive relationships. Now confess it to God and loose them off. With help from His Word, make a plan to live in a new way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are the poor in spirit...' Matthew 5:3 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>In the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em>, who does God consider 'blessed'? This basically means supremely happy. You might find it surprising. Right before we start, note that Jesus isn't simply giving us instructions - He's talking about people who <em>already</em> find themselves in these situations.</p>
<p>'<em>Supremely happy are the poor in Spirit</em>' ...what? Jesus isn't talking about having low self-esteem. (Actually both arrogance and an unhealthily low self-esteem are both really about <em>me</em>, <em>me</em>, <em>me</em>.) Jesus is talking about a genuine humility that sees God as Saviour and recognises our desperate need for Him. In other words: 'if you feel weak, if you lack confidence, if you know you need to turn to God for whatever reason, how good it is to be you!' However life and other people make you feel, if you're right with God, you are blessed!</p>
<p>To be supremely happy, keep your focus on what matters and live for what lasts. Each winter in Kemi, Finland, you can visit a sprawling ice castle that features a theatre, a playground, an art gallery and a chapel. The castle walls are 4 metres high and stretch for over 500 metres. The chapel is a popular wedding venue and the theatre can seat 3,000 people. In it rock concerts, musicals, modern dance and opera recitals have been held. The problem is, its upkeep costs millions of dollars and, each year, it all melts in the spring. Do you get the idea? Focus on what lasts, not on what doesn't.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.' Psalm 66:19 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>History proves that much prayer results in much blessing; and little prayer, little blessing. John Wesley was instrumental in changing the spiritual climate of Britain. In the 18th Century, enormous crowds gathered to hear his open-air preaching, with many encountering the person of Jesus for the first time. His efforts founded the Methodist movement, which has since spread worldwide. All without the help of ticket promoters, cars, phones, TV appearances, anything. His fuel: <em>prayer</em>. He said, 'I have so much to do that I must spend several hours in prayer before I am able to do it.' Much prayer, much blessing.</p>
<p>Over 500 years ago, a little known German monk lost patience with a greedy and ungodly Church. His bullet-pointed criticisms spread across Europe and ignited the Reformation, a major historical turning point for getting the Church back on track. Martin Luthers secret was this: 'Prayer is the most important thing in my life. If I should neglect prayer for a single day, I should lose a great deal of the fire of faith.' Much prayer, much blessing. A teeny Albanian nun became one of the most beloved and inspirational women of the last century for her work in the slums of Calcutta. Mother Teresa's secret to endurance: 'Prayer enlarges the heart until it is capable of containing God's gift of Himself.' Much prayer, much blessing. Ask God to help you make prayer a habit and priority in your daily life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'But Paul shook the snake off into the fire...' Acts 28:5 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The story's told of a farmer whose mule fell into a well. Since he had no way to get him out, he decided to bury him there. He got a truckload of dirt and dumped it on top of the mule. But instead of lying down under it, the mule started kicking and snorting until he worked his way to the top of it. This continued all afternoon. Truckload after truckload, the mule just kept shaking it off and stepping on top of it. Finally when the dirt reached the top of the well the mule just snorted and walked away, a dirtier but a wiser mule. What was intended to bury him, just brought him out on top. On his way to Rome Paul was shipwrecked on an island. As he was gathering firewood a snake attached itself to his arm. What did he do? The Bible says he just 'shook it off'.</p>
<p>There's an important lesson for you in those two stories. You can either dwell on the past, or shake it off and move toward the future God has planned for you. Paul, a man with a past, writes: '<em>Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are ahead</em>.' (Philippians 3:13 NKJ) Now, Paul didn't forget his past, he just shook it off and kept going. You say, 'But I've failed so badly.' The Bible says, '...He] will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NAS) Sometimes forgiveness requires a healing process, but until you make the decision to forgive yourself and others, and shake it off, the process can't even begin.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>' It is not good that man should be alone.' Genesis 2:18 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>God wants you to have good, long-lasting relationships that run deep. We're built that way. Genesis contains these words from God: '<em>It is not good that man should be alone</em>.' Later in the Bible, He brought Jonathan a great friend in David; to the widow Naomi He gave Ruth, a daughter-in-law who gave her a reason to live again. And to Paul He brought a very supportive companion, Timothy. We can read all that in the Bible, but the message is pretty much common sense - a lonely life is not much fun. God doesn't want you to make your way through life all by yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know that God wants a relationship with each one of us, but sometimes we forget how much. Every day, make it your priority to remind yourself of your worth, value and purpose from God. Think of how precious that bond between you and God is. And secondly, remember that friends are God's life preservers, and life enrichers. He never created you to go it alone. Trust Him to bring you those you need to have around you, and ask Him to help you build lasting relationships. And remember: He sees your imperfection, handles your rejection and loves you regardless. So don't throw someone aside because they made a mistake. Instead recall the love He has for us all and work that into your relationships.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'We are labourers together...' 1 Corinthians 3:9 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>The Apprentice</em>: a boardroom look at entrepreneurial talent or an excuse for desperate business graduates to take out their frustration and anger on each other? Each episode, teams are headed up by different project managers in order to win money-making tasks. Often the degree of success will depend on the style of the project manager. One will start discussions, share ideas and encourage people to feel good about their involvement; others will charge off to do their own thing, leaving a confused and squabbling team behind them.</p>
<p>Your (Christian) achievements similarly depend on the way you treat others. Anyone who goes it alone in this faith walk is going to end up disheartened or burnt out. '<em>We are labourers together...</em>' - this means we need to work together. Jesus Himself didn't tackle His work alone; instead He included 12 ordinary people in the work; 12 disciples who prayed with the sick along with Him, 12 disciples who met with the poor by His side. If you want to do great things for God you'll need to work well with Gods people! True success is shared success, and it only happens when you're willing to invest in the lives of others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This work had been done with the help of our God.' Nehemiah 6:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>A good level of self-confidence helps with sports, studies and even life in general. But when it comes down to what we really rely on deep down, our self-confidence may perhaps fail us. Sometimes people realise this at different times in their lives - after a breakup, or when an identity crisis hits - but the good news is that were not designed to live depending on self-confidence.</p>
<p>Nehemiah shows us how <em>confidence in God is the best groundwork a life can be laid on</em>. In his book (named, with startling originality... <em>Nehemiah</em>), it tells how he heard about the terrible state that Jerusalem was in after the Temple of God was destroyed by the Babylonians. He set aside his own problems and focused on the nations. Nehemiah was so burdened that he 'wept... mourned... and prayed before... God...' (Nehemiah 1:4 NIV) Heres the key: he said, 'I know who You are, God, and I know who we are. Your people have rejected You, but were coming back and You can give us success.' God honoured His prayer by enabling the walls to be rebuilt in 52 days, making the enemy nations lose <em>their</em> self-confidence, 'because they realised this work had been done with the help of... God'. Nehemiah kept his reliance on God as his starting point.</p>
<p>God needs people who follow Him closely in their own lives and who can turn weakness into strength, obstacles into stepping stones and disaster into triumph. As a follower of Christ, people watch you every day. The question is,<em> do they know who you're following? And that it's about Him - not you?</em><strong><em> </em></strong></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 4-6, Mark 12:13-27, Ps 101, Pr 13:20-23<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... She was made straight, and glorified God.' Luke 13:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When Jesus healed a woman who had been crippled for 18 years, she (unsurprisingly) started rejoicing. Yippee! Yahoo! Break out the poppers and streamers! It would be easy to imagine all the people around her were as delighted as she was. But the majority decided to lay into Jesus for healing her on the Sabbath day (the religious day of rest)! They chose joyless 'religion' instead of rejoicing over something genuinely good. What did the woman do? Did she give them a good shake: 'Just look at me, you hard-hearted bunch! I'm free after 18 long years of pain! Check in with yourself?' No, she kept on praising! She didn't feel the need to defend herself. She knew better than any of them that the Lord was her defender. Their minds were set and not open to change, and the woman was wise not to get swept away with the mood they were setting. If she did, her defensiveness could have turned a great moment into something very ugly.</p>
<p>Ever get drawn into a faith-fight? Focus on how wonderful God is rather than how wonderfully wrong some people are. Don't get pulled into arguments. When you drop defending yourself, you open a door for the Lord to 'fight' for you, and you set a better mood in conversations.<strong><em> </em></strong>Look at Romans 12:9-21. It's a great passage of love in action. The love of Christ that others see in you will triumph over a faith-fight every time. Ask God to help you to focus on praising and emulating Him and to have an open heart to understand others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lam 1:1-3:39, Mark 12:28-44, Ps 108, Pr 13:24-25<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Because You say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>'[Jesus] said to Simon: &quot;Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.&quot; Simon answered, &quot;Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because You say so, I will...&quot; When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.' (Luke 5:4-6 NIV) Notice two principles in this story: (1) God will use failure to get your attention. Peter was tired, empty-handed and disappointed when Jesus spoke to him. And He will speak to you through the difficult times. He doesn't want you to run from your problems, He wants you to learn from them; to discover the difference He can make in your situation when you invite Him into it. (2) God can take you back to the place of failure and give you success. We assume that because we weren't successful at something, it wasn't God's will. But often the truth is that we failed because we relied on our own strength instead of His. The Bible says: '...They caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signalled their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.' (Luke 5:6-7 NIV) God is not limited by your circumstances or past failures; because He chooses to work through faith, He's limited only by your unbelief. When you obey Him, you'll discover He has a level of abundance in mind that will exceed all your expectations.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lam 3:40-5:22, Mark 13:1-11, Ps 113, Pr 14:1-4<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Let us strip off every weight that slows us down.' Hebrews 12:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jim Collins, author of the business book <em>Good to Great</em>, noticed that <em>good</em> companies could become <em>great</em> companies if they stripped away stuff that was slowing them down. It's good advice for everyday lives as well. He writes: 'Most of us lead busy but undisciplined lives. We have ever expanding 'to do' lists, trying to build momentum by doing, doing, doing. But it rarely works. Those who built the good to great companies made as much use of 'stop doing' lists, as 'to do' lists. They displayed a remarkable discipline to unplug from all sorts of extraneous junk and channel their resources into only one or a few areas.'</p>
<p>Paul writes along the same lines about our busy lives: 'Let us strip off every weight that slows us down... And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.' Sometimes it's negative attitudes, laziness or plain old messy sin that stops us from reaching our potential. Other times it's just because were too <em>busy </em>to be of any use. We over-commit to stuff or fill our time with things that, though not bad in themselves, keep us from what we're called to do. 'Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' (Proverbs 19:21 NIV) Prayerfully think through what God is calling you to do. Ask what is stopping you from getting on with the job. Now tear up the 'to-do list' and create a 'to-stop' list. In other words, begin to strip off every weight that slows you down.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Amos 1:1-5:17, Mark 13:12-23, Ps 82, Pr 14:5-8<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.' 1 Samuel 18:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jealousy lives off the little scraps you feed it the more fodder you push its way, the hungrier it becomes. Until one day it swallows you up from the inside out. A textbook case for this is the story of King Saul.</p>
<p>David returns home having successfully protected king and country and so the women from the towns of Israel sing, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands!' Saul's gutted when the lyrics lift him up only to bump him down to size. He starts feeding his jealousy until it totally devours him.</p>
<p>It probably started with harmless thoughts like, '<em>Numbers aren'</em><em>t everything!</em> <em>I'</em><em>m the king, he'</em><em>s just a kid with a sling</em>.' But before long they keep him up at night, making him wonder what David has that he hasn't. He begins to compare himself with David, instead of seeking God's perspective on the situation. He wonders why he holds the title 'King' when this shepherd boy gets all the respect. And then he starts to see David's face everywhere he looks, hear his name mentioned in every conversation. He can't stop thinking about the power and influence he's losing. Until one day the king launches a spear at the boy's head, but it's his own heart that's pierced with shame. Jealousy clamps its jaws shut on Saul's spirit.</p>
<p>In the next few days we're going to be looking at the deadly effects of jealousy. Saul's rivalry with David is our kick-off point. Start today by reading the story in 1 Samuel 18:1-16.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:23, 1 John 2:15-17, Gen 39:1-23, Pr 29:18<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... They measure themselves by themselves...' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Life is too short for unhealthy comparisons. If a goalkeeper starts getting jealous because he hasn't scored a single goal, the team's probably heading for trouble. And when King Saul started treating a good friend and faithful servant, David, as his competition, he'd lost the plot. God had handed Saul a major player for his team, but all he saw was a new enemy. So victory for the nation was replaced by Saul's need for victory for himself.</p>
<p>Psalm 39:5-6 CEV says that 'Human life is but a breath and it disappears like a shadow.' We have little of life in quantity, so let's make up for that in quality! Always comparing yourself to others will water down the richness of life. Measuring life in terms of personal victories over others will steal away its joy.</p>
<p>A certain level of competitiveness is good. But there's no place for it at the core of our lives, at the centre of our motivations. What about you? Have you taken your eyes off your own game? Remember the story of King Saul and David. Jealousy will make us lose sight of what's really important, like Saul lost sight of what God had done for him. Don't get green-eyed about that talented person next to you, rather think about how you can encourage them. God has given you your own set of talents, skills and desires. Focus on doing what God created you especially for.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Amos 5:18-9:15, Mark 13:24-37, Ps 117, Pr 14:9-12<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<p>Paul wrote these tough words to a church plagued by internal strife and divided loyalty: 'You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarrelling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? For when one says, &quot;I follow Paul,&quot; and another, &quot;I follow Apollos,&quot; are you not mere men? What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants...' (1 Corinthians 3:3-5 NIV)</p>
<p>Bickering over who's the best preacher in town kept this church from other, much more important things. Understanding your gifts and your God-given purpose frees you from the need to measure yourself by the runner in the next lane, or someone playing a different position on the team. When you understand this, your sense of inadequacy will be healed and you'll be able to enjoy and complement others. You'll also be able to break free from sibling rivalry and show everyone that success is not about being like somebody else, but about being the best you can be, and all God made you to be.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 1-4, Mark 14:1-11, Ps 121, Pr 14:13-16<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[' There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>So, down to the core of the matter. What exactly makes comparing yourself to others unhealthy? It's about identity.</p>
<p>The book <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> describes an unusual technique for creating art - if you are drawing a chair, for example, you draw the space around it rather than the object itself. You define the chair by drawing the things that are not the chair. When it comes to identity, you can't afford to live this way. If you start defining ourselves by what you're not, your life will start to look like an empty canvas. To live like Jesus, to live in the way you've been called to, you must define yourself by what you actually <em>are</em>!</p>
<p>And what are you? Well, if you're a follower of Jesus, your identity resembles a list of Christmas presents far too good to be true, far too undeserved to be possible... You're <em>accepted, chosen, appreciated</em><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><em>free</em>. Your identity is drawn in His hands (Isaiah 49:15-16), not drawn in the sand (Matthew 7:24-26). It's solid and immovable. You're <em>corrected, forgiven</em><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><em>forgiving -</em><em> </em>a human being, who lives <em>at peace, with God</em>. That's not to be passed over lightly. Your life has a distinctive scent of godliness to it, like nothing and no one else on this planet. It's the gift of identity that is the final answer to the question: 'Who am I?' When you understand <em>who</em> you are and <em>what</em> God created you to be - <em>being yourself</em> brings glory to God! Here's a prayer to say today: 'Lord, I'm thankful for who You made me; I've finished complaining or wishing I could be somebody else.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 5-9, Mark 14:12-26, Ps 4, Pr 14:17-20<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52889&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Godliness with contentment is great gain.' 1 Timothy 6:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>We've discovered that the way out of a life of jealousy is to understand the identity and value we have through Christ. But what stops us from sliding back? A lifestyle built on today's verse: 'Godliness with contentment is great gain.' So, let's take it apart to see how it works.</p>
<p>First, <em>what does </em><em>godliness</em><em> look like?</em> Simply put, it's the characteristics of God that we can imitate in our own lives. Love, patience, faithfulness, forgiveness and consistency. It's when we seek to love against the odds, when we're patient though we could be careless, when we forgive though we hurt, when we're dependable though the short-cut would be easier.</p>
<p>Second, <em>what is it to be content?</em> When you're just as satisfied with a lot as you are with a little, you've cracked contentment. When you don't have to be Queen Bee or King of the Hill to feel happy, you're content. Contentment enables you to get on with the job even when nobody cares you're doing it.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>what is great gain?</em> When we're happy to choose God's way and we're not concerned about getting recognition, we've got great gain in this life. Our everyday experiences are so much richer when we live with godliness and great contentment that our lives can well be described as overflowing with joy! One will lead to the other: godliness to contentment to great gain. So start at the beginning: Galatians 5:22-23 says that God's fruit of the Spirit (in other words, godliness) are 'love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.' Practice those and you will learn contentment and enjoy great gain.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 10-13, Mark 14:27-42, Ps 124, Pr 14:21-24<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52890&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.' Philippians 3:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you're keeping jealousy in your life in check, you're better placed to compare yourself to others in a healthy way. But what do healthy comparisons look like? Ever seen a runner run with a pacesetter? Although pacesetters run too, their job isn't to compete. Rather, it's to set a fast pace for the runner to aspire to.</p>
<p>This is a healthy way of looking at each other. There'll always be a better preacher, or finer singer, or cleverer mind. If we're always trying to compete with those around us, we'll run ourselves straight into the ground so, why not treat others as pacesetters, not competition?</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the great, mature qualities in other people not to bring out your competitive streak, but to set your life at a better pace. If you have a friend who often goes out of her way to witness to others, listen quietly and pick up tips. If you have a friend who's a better listener, learn from his model. (Handy tip: with some skills, the best way to learn is to act as if you already have it, and constantly see what you need to adjust to get better. This is not to try to lie to others, but to grow it in yourself.)</p>
<p>It's a win-win for everyone. Other people will feel treated respectfully; you'll develop in leaps and bounds; and you'll be acting in a way pleasing to God! Think about studying the lives of the great Bible heroes like David, Moses, Job, Esther or Paul. There is serious encouragement in their stories. How can you use their pacesetting to help you run your race?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 14:1-16:52, Mark 14:43-52, Ps 129, Pr 14:25-28<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52891&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But God has revealed [it] to us by His Spirit...' 1 Corinthians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we encouraged you to read up on the lives of the heroes of our faith, but if you do, a word of warning first! Make sure you're not left with a hero-hangover: high on the exploits of King David or the apostle Paul one moment, but over-shadowed by their achievements the next. The temptation is to get deflated because you can't see how to defeat your Goliath or because you're not seeing miracles on the mission field. Remember the Bible or the book is meant to inspire you towards <em>your</em> life's plan, not make you a carbon copy of someone else's.</p>
<p>At some point, we need to put down the books and develop our own trust in God. We need to live out our own vision. It's good to be challenged by some missionary's fervour from the frontline but we must wait on God ourselves. God wants you to follow Him, not someone else's story - no matter how helpful or good it is.</p>
<p>And sometimes when we read these books we can convince ourselves that, say, India or China is where the real action is. But the truth is that people are people: they may look, dress or talk different, but all people are desperately in need of God. There is little difference in being a missionary today in your own neighbourhood and a one in deepest Mongolia. Ask yourself what you can start doing right now! And then ask God, by His Spirit, to reveal to you His plan and your part in it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 16:53-19:14, Mark 14:53-65, Ps 1, Pr 14:29-32<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52892&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All Your words are true; all Your righteous laws are eternal.' Psalm 119:160 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever been to a doughnut factory? You can follow the whole doughnut-making process along a little conveyor belt, from liquid batter to crude dough lump, right through to the final glazed product. You wouldn't want to pick up a doughnut at the half-way point - it'd fall right through your hands like custard. Some things just need the time and effort before you can see the rewards.</p>
<p>Microwave your Bible-reading time? No chance. Shortcuts might be useful to get to the other side of town quicker, but not for things that are eternally worthwhile. The Bible works best by slow degrees; God's wisdom breathed into the lives of His children, into the fabric of their day-to-day experiences and thoughts. Treat it as a book of sound bites and you'll get the odd puff of wind in your sails - why go for that when you could have gale force?</p>
<p>When you know that you should be reading your Bible a bit more, it's easy to guilt-trip yourself about it. But that won't get you anywhere. Go to God and ask the Holy Spirit to help you as you read. Know the Author. Don't necessarily expect anything big (although you can never rule that out with God), but read calmly and patiently, and see what you get! Drifting in and out of your Bible when the mood takes you might be convenient and time-saving, but it won't be life-changing. Try to make it a pattern that comes easily after a bit of practice. It doesn't particularly matter how long you spend at first, just that it becomes a regular thing.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Matt 5:3, Luke 18:9-14, Isaiah 57:14-21, 2 Sam 7:18-29<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52893&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who abides in Me...bears much fruit.' John 15:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Some people view the Christian life as a bed of thornless roses, others see it as a battlefield. The first group says, 'If I've enough faith, I'll never be sick, broke or have problems.' The second group says, 'Every time I stick my head up out of the trench, another disaster shoots me down.' The truth is, our faith levels are revealed by hard times. When our backs are to the wall financially we need faith to believe that God is Jehovah Jireh, <em>the Lord who provides</em>. When were battling illness we need faith to believe He's Jehovah Rapha, <em>the great physician who promises to heal</em>.</p>
<p>Reality isn't always easy. God gives us hope but He doesn't grant our every wish. Fantasising about winning the lottery or having a smaller nose won't make things easier in the long run, if we're to grow in a mature way.</p>
<p>For the Christian, blessing comes from staying close to the Lord. Jesus said that we 'abide' in Him. 'Abiding' is like <em>standing with</em>, or more accurately,<em> living in</em>. Living in Jesus' life means we are, all of us, in the hands of the Father. In today's verse, Jesus is saying that those who live within His being during the tough times are going to get the blessing - closeness to Him. Those who face life as it is will find life as it should be. So, pray for the strength and endurance to face the more uncomfortable facts of reality, whatever they are for you today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 20-21, Mark 14:66-72, Ps 48, Pr 14:33-35<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52895&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Am I trying to please people?' Galatians 1:10 NCV<br /><br /><p>'Am I trying to please people?' is a great question to ask ourselves. For whatever reason, we can fall into the same old people-pleasing trap over and over again. And so we become the shoulder to cry on, not because we want to help someone out, but rather because we like the feeling of being needed. Or we volunteer to help out at any given opportunity, not out of an act of service, but because we enjoy being known as the 'helpful' one.</p>
<p>When our goal becomes about elevating ourselves rather than God, we're never going to be truly happy. There will always be someone to point out our failings. There will always be people who let us know when we've done well. But what you say about yourself or what others think about you is secondary. The opinion that counts above all others is God's and, as you know, you already have God's approval! So, don't use your kind acts as a way of building yourself up, but use God's approval as inspiration to carry out kindness. People-pleasing leads to disappointment; God's approval leads to people pleased. Ask the Holy Spirit for help to answer these questions: <em>Do I do things for others because You want me to or because I need to feel needed? Do I do things for others out of guilt or fear? Do I do things for others because I feel I </em>have<em> to</em> <em>or because You'</em><em>ve asked me?</em> Only when God is your source of approval will you be totally satisfied and content to be yourself.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 22-23, Mark 15:1-20, Ps 132:1-10, Pr 15:1-4<br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=53485&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... Am I trying to please people?' Galatians 1:10 NCV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Yesterday we considered how pleasing people is often rooted in pleasing ourselves. Paul gives us strong warnings about getting preoccupied with pleasing anyone other than God: <em>'If people's thinking is controlled by the sinful self, there is death. But if their thinking is controlled by the Spirit, there is life and peace. When people's thinking is controlled by the sinful self, they are against God, because they refuse to obey God's law and really are not even able to obey God's law. Those people who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God.'</em> (Romans 8:6-8 NCV)</p>
<p>Yes, Paul warns us that God isn't best pleased when were seeking to feel good about ourselves through the wrong means. However, He also gives us the solution. Attention to what pleases God is like the key for our prison door. Knowing what God wants of us frees us from what others want from us. This should give us the courage to say 'no' to things that need saying 'no' to. It should give us the freedom to be who we are rather than try to live up to others' expectations. It should give us guilt-free consciences rather than worries about letting others down. God always has the key to our prisons. So, know your values, relax, and just stay connected to Him. He will... 'equip you with all you need for doing His will...[and] produce in you...every good thing that is pleasing to Him...' (Hebrews 13:21 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.' Genesis 32:30 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>Early on in the Bible there's a story about a wrestling bout. A real smackdown. And Contender Number 2 was no one less than the Creator of the universe! You might have heard people say they've 'struggled with God', but Jacob did this for real and went toe-to-toe with the Almighty Himself. Up to this point he had lived a life of deception and lies. So, in God's eyes, this midnight grapple was probably as much Jacob's fight with his own identity as it was a physical brawl. Jacob came out of the struggle able to say, '<em>I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared</em>.' What a thing to say!</p>
<p>Are you facing an identity crisis, struggling to come to terms with who you are? Well, today's story gives us hope that, when we wrestle with such things, the struggle may take a lot out of us but in the end well be stronger for going face-to-face with God, rather than turning our backs on Him. For those of us battling our past, God says,'<em>...if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!</em>' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) If you're grappling with what others say about you, take heart, '<em>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends</em>.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 NIV) For those who struggle to see any future, '...God's powerful hand...will lift you up when the right time comes.' (1 Peter 5:6 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'There hath no temptation taken you...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>We've deliberately chosen an old-fashioned language translation for today's verse because we want to focus on the word '<em>taken</em>'. When you're in a big city you make sure you're holding onto your bag or wallet tightly. If you're in a particularly rough area you'd hold it closer. Your awareness of danger is heightened. If only we had that same awareness when it came to temptation - that sense of protecting what's valuable.</p>
<p>A guy might find his iPhone innocent enough. But when he's alone and temptation beckons, how easy is it to access sites that could lead him astray? A girl might think there's nothing wrong with her latest e-book, but what imagery is it placing in her head?</p>
<p>The moment has taken them to some places they shouldn't be. The image might last a few moments; the results linger longer. Why? Because lust promises what it can't deliver. We believe the pictures will satisfy a need, but what it creates is a drive for more and more. The problem with porn is that it <em>takes</em> you to a place you shouldn't be, where you can't protect what's valuable. For the next few days we'll be talking about the dangers of pornography. (If this isn't something you struggle with yourself, please pray for those who do, and learn more about the struggle they have!) Rather than hide from God in shame, be honest about your struggles (whatever they are). Hebrews 4:16 NIV says: '<em>Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need</em>.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... but such as is common to man...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NAS<br /><br /></p>
<p>Proverbs 7 is a rich poem that describes foolishness as a beautifully dressed woman ready to pounce and kill. The loaded imagery shows the woman enticing the man with honeyed words and sweet promises into a secret room - a place where she can hold and kiss him. The final line is a twist - her house is actually on the road to death. A pretty serious twist, really.</p>
<p>But what a picture of how pornography works on our senses. Like promiscuity (sleeping around or fooling around), it offers the excitement of intimacy with no strings attached. The secret is kept between yourself and the internet, your own personal laptop, iPad or phone. Is it ok to have one without the other - sex without the bond of an actual relationship? We'll look at that in tomorrow's reading. Today, though, know that secrecy, one of pornography's strongest weapons, is the first barrier to attack. A secret isolates you so you can't get help from anybody. A secret tells you not to let anybody else know, because you will be judged. And without support you're left wondering whether God could possibly love you. (In battle, its called a <em>Divide</em><em>-</em><em>and</em><em>-</em><em>Conquer</em> strategy.)</p>
<p>'<em>No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man</em>.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NAS) This lets us know we're not alone in the struggle. We are sensory creatures. The contours of a body appeal to our senses. The problem isn't the body. The problem is the lust that comes with the territory and draws us into slavery or addiction. Think hard about breaking this secret (or any other secret you're holding on to) by asking a trustworthy church or youth leader to support you in your struggle.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... But God is faithful...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Let's not beat about the fig-tree: why is it wrong to go ahead with sex if you both feel like you love each other, and you both want it? The answer from God is <em>not</em> that sex is wrong, it's that it's <em>precious</em>. That means it has to be handled with care.</p>
<p>The reason Christians hold back sex for marriage is not to deprive the singles. It's not even to build up our faith while we're waiting. It's because it connects us on the deepest human level to another person. Sharing ourselves through sex has such potential to damage and destroy us that, frankly, we almost shouldn't be trusted with it at all. We certainly should make sure we only allow ourselves to share ourselves sexually in the most strong, stable, committed relationship there is: marriage. (By the way, this isn't even a young thing, look at how many adults are mis-using sex and getting torn up by it.)</p>
<p>This is why porn is so damaging. It's like sex's physical pleasure without the joy of marriage. More on that tomorrow, but for today, the point is that God isn't a kill-joy. He's given you the best He could invent, and told you to handle with care. And if you use it right, at the right time, it's a part of what your bodies were made for. Set boundaries for yourself, firm ones, today, and stick to them. For those who need a reset button: <em>God absolutely will forgive you if you ask for it</em>. He will. Memorise this verse to help you live without shame: '<em>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for</em>.' (Proverbs 16:6 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I have the right to do anything...' 1 Corinthians 6:12 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>CS Lewis writes, 'Now suppose you came to a country where you could fill a theatre by simply bringing a covered plate onto the stage and then slowly lifting the cover as to let everyone see, just before the lights went out, that it contained a mutton chop or a bit of bacon, would you not think that in that country something had gone wrong with the appetite for food?'</p>
<p>Lewis is saying that something is wrong in our culture's attitude to sex. Striptease shows, chat-lines, internet porn...all signs that our appetite for the naked body has taken a wrong turn somewhere.</p>
<p>Augustine long ago defined 'Sin' as 'man turned in upon himself'. Were designed to be (1) turned up to God, to receive His love, (2) turned out to each other, to share His and our love.</p>
<p>Porn is all about you, and you only. The more of yourself you give to it, the less youll be able to feel the love of God or other people. Paul looked at freedom like this: '<em>I have the right to do anything - but I will not be mastered by anything</em>.' (1 Corinthians 6:12) Clicking on porn isn't a sign of being truly free with sexuality; it's a sign on the route to addiction of some form. Like the woman in chapter 7 of Proverbs, porn will seduce us with sweet talk to our face, but stab us in the back when we're not looking. Addiction diverts us off the path of freedom.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... God...will...make a way of escape...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Staying clear of porn these days is probably harder to do than at any other time. It is so readily available, and not just on the internet. Random products are sold on billboard posters by scantily-dressed models and music channels parade very explicit videos. Our culture presents sex as the best that this life has to offer. Our hearts were designed to be devoted with God; but instead we have a generation devoted to seeking out sex.</p>
<p>So how do we break free? Jesus. Jesus is the original and best rope-breaker. The reliable Saviour. So obviously, start by running to Him. Want to be free? Ask Him. Spend time talking to Him about it. Make peace with God, on His terms of unconditional acceptance and love, and decide that you're ready to turn your back on porn. Listen for what He's saying to you. Then get practical. Think of the times and places where porn tempts you, and take steps to stamp its voice out. Make that time your prayer time, and turn your phone or computer off for that time. Whatever your situation is, make it an inside decision to change, and an outside action of change. But, you're not going to go through this alone. Not only are we praying for you, but: '<em>God...will...make a way of escape...</em>' Romans 12:2 NIV says, '<em>Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind</em>.' If this series was for you, ask God/a pastor/youth-worker/friend for practical ways to transform your mind. If not, today pray for those who are trapped in addiction.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Catch... the little foxes that spoil the vines...' Song of Solomon 2:15 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Today's verse is one of those Biblical double-takes: <em>what does it even mean</em>? A bit of context for you: in Old Testament times, grapes, melons and other fruits grew on vines. (Matter of fact: they still do!) Without grapes or melons, the people's diet would suffer. So, people in these ancient cultures depended heavily on the growth of these vines.</p>
<p>A little fox might look sweet in Disney cartoons and it might be just an urban pest in cities, but it's actually a serious threat to crops (and chooks!) in the country. Let one in, and then another and a few too many 'fox incidents' means that nobody gets to eat.</p>
<p>So, what are the pesky foxes in your life; small things that seem insignificant but left unattended will one day trip you up? Maybe it's a relationship that doesn't seem to be doing too much damage right now, but that you know isn't right for you. Chase off the fox before the vine is spoiled. Maybe it's a little wardrobe replenishment habit you've formed. Watch it before it turns out to be a crippling debt problem! What little foxes do you need to catch today? Little resentments, habits, or areas of dishonesty nip them in the bud. Do you need to be honest with someone or stop doing something? Put a date in your diary now to deal with it and make that date today!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The... years of abundance... came to an end.' Genesis 41:53 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>When Joseph became a ruler in Egypt, he saw hard times on the horizon. So he '<em>stored up huge quantities of grain... The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food</em>.' (Genesis 41:49-54 NIV) Joseph had been warned of a coming famine, so he acted responsibly in the years leading up to it.</p>
<p>The hard truth is that many of us are not so responsible. Take money, for instance. We probably don't need half of the small things we buy but we buy them anyway. We've heard somewhere that we're supposed to give ten per cent of our money to God but, hey, we excuse ourselves by thinking that's just for the people who've got the big bucks... and, anyway, if you gave ten per cent you'd have nothing to buy your small things with, right?</p>
<p>Jesus isn't necessarily looking for set figures or budget breakdowns. He's more concerned about your attitude. He commends a widow for giving a few cents to the church offering because he knows her attitude is right. He challenges the Pharisees for giving buckets of dollars because He knows their hearts are wrong. Consider your attitude to money. It is meant to be a blessing to you and to others. God doesn't want you to hoard the blessing for yourself but to share it responsibly with others, just as Joseph did.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Don't be jealous or proud, but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves.' Philippians 2:3 CEV <br /><br /></p>
<p>Without 'bit-part' extras in films the story cannot be told. Often Christians who are digging in and serving God or helping other people are compared to bit-part extras. But it doesn't sound ideal, does it? Where's the joy in that, when you could be the star? Why do we bother serving? Well, let's rein it in for a second; there's no point in serving if you dont know who you're doing it for or why!</p>
<p>Firstly, <em>serving takes attention away from yourself and towards God.</em> This isn't about God being vain, but it's about Him being <em>personal</em>, not 'a thing'. God is a person, and He loves it when you do things for Him; simple, really! The act of serving is one of the best ways of redirecting our eyes to Him. Secondly, <em>serving helps you.</em> Self-serving is actually one of the most damaging ways of life: it will turn you inside-out and leave you feeling empty. Serving others causes your character to blossom beautifully, and shifts your heart to point towards God. And finally, <em>serving helps others.</em> It lifts them up in love: opens them more to the love of God, and helps them to see Him more clearly.</p>
<p>So serving is good in God's eyes and helpful for you. There's great joy in it that can't be found elsewhere. Practice the art of the bit-part today. Volunteer to help with a job at church feel the buzz of helping somebody else get the praise because you quietly did your part without considering how it would either benefit you or put you out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Rejoice with those who rejoice...' Romans 12:15 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Paul writes, '<em>Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep</em>.' The second part is easy enough. When your near-perfect best mate has been dumped by the local Romeo or Juliet, it's easy enough to offer a few consoling words. But the first part, '<em>Rejoice with those who rejoice...</em>' well, that's a different scenario altogether. It's harder to feel happy with friends when they get things we wanted and we missed out. When they succeed in a way that we haven't, it becomes tricky to hold to these words from the Bible.</p>
<p>Envy tries every trick in the book to stop you being happy for others. We compare ourselves to others and wonder why God isn't cutting us a break too. Instead of playing the 'poor me' card, why not do as Paul suggests? Maybe today is not your day to be super-blessed. Such is life. But it will come, and wouldn't you want others to be happy for you when that day comes for you? So do the same for them, and '<em>rejoice with those who rejoice...</em>'</p>
<p>It's amazing how much better you can feel when you are simply happy with someone who has been blessed. If you think about them and not yourself, you can enjoy their success too. Try it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Trust in the Lord...' Proverbs 3:5 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>'<em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.</em>' (Proverbs 5-6 NKJ) But what if your path leads through pain, pressure and problems? John the Baptist's did. He didn't deserve imprisonment. After all, he was Jesus' cousin and the voice of God in his community. So he sent Jesus a message asking, '<em>Are you really the Messiah, or should we keep looking?</em>' Rephrased: 'If you're Lord, and you're in charge, 'going on with this prison business?!' It's a question based on unfulfilled expectations. We think, 'Lord, if You're good, how come things aren't working out for me?' If you're in this sort of situation, it's not that God has suddenly turned against you. We don't know a definite explanation of 'why' bad things happen, but we do know that, even in the midst of them, God is on our side. That means He is for you in a very real way, right now. He asks us to trust Him, and trust He knows what He's doing. We can be sure it is in His very nature to turn shocking situations for good. Want an example? How about the cross...? So whatever your circumstances you can say, 'I don't know why this is happening, but I know and trust that God can redeem it, and bring good out of it.'<br /><br /><b><span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot;>SoulFood: 2 Cor</span><span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot;> 9:1–11:15, Luke 2:8–20, Ps 144:9–15, Pr 16:4–7 </span></b><br /><br /><small>word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia. 2013 UCB International Ltd</small><img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=53543&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /></p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My life is worth nothing... unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord...' Acts 20:24 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>You wonder what's up when multi-million recording artists end up overdosed on prescription drugs. Or when footballers who have graced fields around the world finish their lives drowning in alcohol. Or when movie stars bring their lives to an end in hotel rooms. It seems you can have it all and yet have nothing. Sometimes the things we desire most (fame, money, power) are the things most deadly for us. If you want to make your life count, don't think celebrity status will help - sign yourself over to God instead. Root your life in Him.</p>
<p>DL Moody once said, 'Give your life to God; He can do more with it than you can.' Ephesians 1:11 NLT goes further: '<em>Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us in advance, and He makes everything work out according to His plan.</em>' That's the big picture. And it is a <em>big </em>picture! As God's children, we get to build for God's Kingdom. God promises that we will be part of the purpose He is working out in everything and everyone, in all of history. It may not be fame in the world's eyes, but you will truly have success, and treasure in God. So focus on the only profession truly worth giving your attention to - go to Christ, and find out who you are and what you are living for. What skills or talents has God placed in you to work for His Kingdom? Pray that He will do more with your talent than you could ever do yourself.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for [you]...' 2 Corinthians 10:13 GNT<br /><br /><p>Let's get something straight. <em>N</em><em>obody</em> is good at everything and <em>nobody</em> is called to do everything. God has given each of us clearly defined roles in life. Paul understood that his job wasn't to achieve everything or try to please everyone, but to focus on what God had called and equipped <em>him</em> to do: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' You want to be successful? You'll only manage it if you're doing what God wants you to (and, though it's sometimes opposite to the world's definition of success, God's is the only one worth considering in the long run).</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled: Satan will try to rob you of the joy of serving God by getting you to compare yourself with Brainy McSmarts, some celebrity Barbie-lookalike or even, for us Christians, some seemingly perfect super-saint in church. Satan loves pressuring you to fit into the expectations of others. Don't do it! (Insert slow-motion: <em>'Nooooooo...'</em>) You'll always find someone who <em>seems</em> to be doing a better job than you, and you'll become discouraged.</p>
<p>God's calling for your life is completely different from theirs: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' The Bible says: 'Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.' (Galatians 6:4 NLT) John Bunyan, author of the Christian classic, <em>Pilgrim'</em><em>s Progress</em>, wrote: 'If my life is fruitless it doesn't matter who praises me. And if my life is fruitful it doesn't matter who criticises me.' So, just do what God's called you to do!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judges 12-15, Mark 11:1-11, Ps 97, Pr 13:9-10<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Lord, teach us to pray...' Luke 11:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>One person can be crazy joyful for a friend who'd go on <em>Australia</em><em>'s Got Talent</em> dressed up as tulip. Another feels like hiding out behind their knees and twitching with a #awkward.</p>
<p>Turns out we're all different (who knew?!) So then it's good news that God values all types of people and all types of people's prayers. Most importantly He relates to us all in the way that meets each of us. Do you ever feel like you don't know how to pray? Do you spend a lot of time listening to other people pray and then try to pray like them? Well, although there are some principles of prayer that apply to everyone, God will lead each of us individually. He wants to take you just the way you are, and help you discover your own rhythm of prayer. He wants you to develop a style of prayer that maximises <em>your</em> relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Prayer isn't ordering a take-away from Heaven, expecting what we pray for to drop out of the sky in a stay-warm box with extra mozzarella. It's not a lamp that needs to be rubbed for the genie to come out and grant us some wishes. It's a chat with God, the original heart-to-heart, which includes taking the time to also hear what He wants to say to you. A really good place to start is to simply ask Him, just as the disciples did, 'Lord, teach me to pray.'</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Jesus... spent the night praying...' Luke 6:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Do as I say, not as I do' isn't exactly a quality pep-talk. Sadly, a survey revealed that, of 1000 pastors, half admitted that they can go through long periods of time without taking time out to pray. Some preached persuasive sermons about prayer, yet it wasn't a feature in their own life.</p>
<p>We shouldn't look to the religious people in the Bible for the most perfect way to be or how to relate with God. They are human beings with human failings. We need to look at Jesus. What did He do? Jesus woke up before dawn and spent hours in prayer. He even prayed all night. Did it show? Of course it did! Look at the miracles He performed, the lives He touched! It will show for you too if you make it your simple routine to start and end each day with God.</p>
<p>You'll start to find yourself praying throughout the day as things come to you. Talking to Him will come to be simply second nature. Most importantly you'll want to do it, rather than feel pressured to. How would you feel if your boyfriend or girlfriend said they feel 'obliged' to spend time with you. No one wants that. Neither does God. Wait what? Is this God-thing, like, a <em>relationship</em>?<strong><em> </em></strong>Joyce Meyer wrote: 'I realise that prayer is a great privilege, not a duty. I no longer approach God in fear, wondering if He will really hear me and send an answer to my prayers. I now approach Him boldly, as His Word teaches me to do, and with great expectation.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:23, Isaiah 40:9-11, Isaiah 42:1-4, Ps 18:31-35<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Evening [and] morning... He hears my voice.' Psalm 55:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Is it a coincidence that Jesus seemed to pray a lot outside? Here are just a few examples from the Bible. 'Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where He prayed.' (Mark 1:35 NIV) 'After leaving them, He went up on a mountainside to pray.' (Mark 6:46 NIV) 'But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' (Luke 5:16 NIV)</p>
<p>The point is that Jesus knew He needed to be somewhere quiet where He'd feel comfortable to best hear from God. Notice in one of the descriptions of Jesus He was slipping away. It gives the impression of not wanting anyone to notice He was leaving so He could have time alone with God. Time that He knew He needed.</p>
<p>Have you got a favourite place to be with God? You should find one. Somewhere where you know you can switch off and just be in His presence. Maybe you love spending time listening to worship music first or getting creative with the Creator by sketching, painting or making something. Don't be afraid to mix things up with God or have fun finding new places to hang out with Him. The most important thing to God is getting to spend time with you, hearing what's on your heart and you hearing whispers from His heart. God enjoys meeting you where you are, developing a personal relationship with you, and helping you grow to become everything He wants you to be!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judges 19:16-21:25, Mark 11:27-33, Ps 45, Pr 13:13-16<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'He fashions their hearts individually...' Psalm 33:15 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Think about all those confident people who just launch into prayer and make it up as they go. They keep on praying for five minutes, while you're trying to think how to fill out five seconds. You're just not all that confident about how to go about this whole praying business. Praying can be nerve-wracking, especially out loud in front of other people. It can be really intimidating to hear someone pray with the biggest mountain-moving zeal imaginable. And really tempting to think you should copy what they say and how they say it. But prayer isn't about how other people go about it. Instead, God wants to spend time with you, the way you'd naturally talk to Him, and let His Spirit take over in a way that's completely <em>you-nique</em>! When we look out for more of the Spirit and less at our own insecurities, that's when exciting things happen. When we stop following our own rituals or someone else's pattern, we allow God room to surprise us as He takes the lead. 'Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.' (2 Corinthians 3:17 NIV) This relationship, more than any other, needs honesty! When it comes to your faith-relationship, God doesn't care how your holy friends pray, but He's desperate to spend quality real time with you! In John 21:22, Jesus urges Peter not to worry about other people's relationships with Him, but to concentrate on his own walk. The Bible says, 'He fashions their hearts individually.' So when it comes to prayer: <em>Be yourself</em>.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts...' Colossians 3:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>We would be a whole lot more chilled out if we worried less and prayed more! In fact, let's go one better - we would be completely transformed if we didn't worry at all and prayed about everything! Philippians 4:6-7 TLB says, 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything; tell God your needs and don't forget to thank Him for His answers. If you do this you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand... His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest...'</p>
<p>Prayer is an exchange service - you give over your worries or problems to Jesus! You get to let go! 'Let Him have all your worries and cares, for He is always thinking about you and watching everything that concerns you. Be careful - watch out for attacks from Satan... Stand firm when he attacks...' (1 Peter 5:7-9 TLB) Don't listen to the enemy's worry-whispers; not even for a second! The moment you find yourself worrying ask, 'What's the enemy trying to do here? If I give in to these thoughts and emotions what's going to happen?' 'Do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:27 NIV) Know your enemy, and each time he attacks put him to flight by saying what Jesus said to him in the wilderness: '...It is written...' (Matthew 4:4 NIV) When Jesus said for the third time, 'It is written,' we read, 'The devil left Him, and angels came and attended Him.' (Matthew 4:11 NIV) So here's the question: <em>How well do you know God's Word?</em></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 32:29-34:12, Mark 9:1-13, Ps 62, Pr 12:18-19<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to be My disciple musttake up their cross daily...' Luke 9:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>An army lieutenant called his platoon together and said: 'Ok boys, I'm looking for volunteers. Chances are, this mission won't succeed and many of you won't come back. If you're interested, step forward.'</p>
<p>Just about the entire troop took a collective step backwards, leaving one unsuspecting 'volunteer' standing alone. God is not looking for 'involuntary volunteers' like that poor soldier. Jesus said, 'If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily.' He wants people who are willing to leave their comfort zone; to give up their expectations that life be lived on their terms; to sacrifice everything for people who may never know they did it; to pay the price so that God's purposes can be fulfilled. And what's more, He expects us to do it daily.</p>
<p>When Jesus said, 'Whoever does not carry his own cross... cannot be My disciple' (Luke 14:27 NAS), He wasn't asking us to do something He Himself hasn't done. Oswald Chambers said, 'If we are devoted to the cause of humanity we will be crushed and broken-hearted, for we shall often meet with ingratitude... But if our motive is love for God, no ingratitude will hinder us from serving our fellow man.' John says, 'We understand what love is when we realise... Christ gave His life for us.' (1 John 3:16 NLT) Think about how you can show people love today. You may not get thanks, but remember, it's for your love for God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Peter 1-5, Mark 9:14-29, Ps 49, Pr 12:20-22<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... You received the spirit of adoption...' Romans 8:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Did you know that you're a member of a Royal Family? Although it may seem like a bit of a stretch from where you are now, when people accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, they become heirs of the Kingdom! They are princes and princesses, so they won't be without any good thing. It's true! Look it up in Philippians 4:19. What a family you're part of!</p>
<p>It's really important to remember <em>how</em> you were adopted in the first place. It's really important to remember you didn't earn it. It was given freely to you by grace. Can you imagine a couple rocking up to an adoption agency, saying, 'We'd love to take on dear little Joe and Susie, but first: do they have a house, money for education, a ride to school in the morning and clothes to wear every day?' The adoption agency would say, 'Hold on a minute. You're not adopting them because of what they have, but because of what they need: love, hope, a home and a future.'</p>
<p>If you didn't get adopted by your efforts you can't lose it through a poor performance, either. How reassuring is that? And it gets better; you're an heir to all your Father owns. That means you'll never have a need He cannot or will not meet. How good is that?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Obadiah, Malachi 1-4, Mark 9:30-37, Ps 18:1-29, Pr 12:23-24<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[ '... Receive the Kingdom of God as a little child...' Mark 10:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>God can tell us He loves us over and over again, but sometimes we can struggle to believe it.</p>
<p>Many of us had a tough time growing up, and we struggle to imagine God as a perfect parent when all we've known is imperfect ones. But even if you haven't been protected like you should have been, God can reverse what you've been through.</p>
<p>What's it like to become a little child again, to allow yourself the kind of relationship with the Lord that you may have missed; to allow Him to heal and adjust the damaged places of your past? Here's what He told His people: 'I passed by and saw you kicking about...and as you lay there...I said to you, &quot;Live!&quot; I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became...beautiful... I...covered your nakedness. I...entered into a covenant [a covenant is a relationship with an unbreakable promise] with you...and you became Mine. I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.' (Ezekiel 16:6-10 NIV) It's a beautiful image of God stooping down to give special attention to you, to nurture you, and to give you a dignity that no one can take away. He's done that for you. Psalm 51:10 GNT says, 'Create a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.' God will never leave you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1-4, Mark 9:38-50, Ps 18:30-50, Pr 12:25-28<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Motives are weighed by the Lord.' Proverbs 16:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Think you're fooling God? Think He's too busy running the universe to notice little ole you? Nice try. He cares about everything in His creation and He's wearing Creator-Ray glasses (think X-ray on overdrive). And He has direct line-of-sight into your heart. So those secret thoughts, those sly intentions, those ulterior motives, yes, He sees them.</p>
<p>Done a good deed and already looking forward to telling your mates about it? He sees. Sitting in church to boost people's opinions of you, but your heart's far from your Father? He sees. Helping the needy, but really sneakily greedy? He sees it all: name, time and place. Surprise, surprise, God sees right through the falsehoods.</p>
<p>The Bible is full of people, including some of the amazing Bible heroes, messing up just like this. Check these verses for some examples: King David, guilty (2 Samuel 11). The nation of Israel, guilty (Isaiah 1:10-17). Peter, guilty (John 18:15-27). And there are a whole heap more.</p>
<p>Take a good look at your heart. God does. Are the things that drive your thoughts and actions things that make the Father's heart sing over you with joy? Or have you allowed a Grand Canyon to open up between you? Wake up and smell the burning of His Creator-Ray-vision - it may cut deeper than youd like. This boils down to nothing more than keeping your relationship open and right with God, and it is definitely easier said than done. Set serious time aside today to ask Him where you need to get right with Him again. Write down the answers He shows you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 23:15-22, Acts 2:1-18<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['The righteous choose their friends carefully...' Proverbs 12:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>Friendship is wonderful, but some friendships can be tricky affairs. If only there were a set of guidelines we could follow, some wise advice to help us know how to have the best friendships.</p>
<p>Proverbs 27 has some helpful tips on discerning the best relationships possible. 'Wounds from a sincere friend are better than many kisses from an enemy.' (Proverbs 27:6 NLT) That's a telling trust tip. '...When disaster strikes, you won't have to ask your brother for assistance.' (Proverbs 27:10 NLT) True friendship means you don't even have to ask - nice!</p>
<p>But what about when things turn sour? The prophet Jeremiah was dismayed at how his people treated each another. He went as far as saying, 'Beware of your friends; do not trust anyone in your clan. For every one of them is a deceiver and every friend a slanderer. Friend deceives friend and no one speaks the truth.' (Jeremiah 9:4-5 NIV) Not feeling the love, eh? Another prophet Isaiah is not much more positive: 'Don't put your trust in mere humans. They are as frail as breath. What good are they?' (Isaiah 2:22 NLT)</p>
<p>The point of today's reading is that it is good to be wise with your relationships. God's Word says it, and were strongly agreeing! Sometimes it's no bad thing to remember that God's the only one we can 100% rely on; and that actually, living that out is likely to improve your friendships rather than weaken them! It's good to remember that good friendship is a two-way street. Have a read of Colossians 3:12-14 to self-check how you relate to others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judges 1-3, Mark 10:1-12, Ps 88:1-9a, Pr 13:1-3<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... If [you]...overdrive them...[they] will die.' Genesis 33:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>Esau and Jacob were pretty different brothers with a very rocky relationship history. They were getting together to celebrate a record number of years without having a go at each other.</p>
<p>Esau had a bit of a just-do-it attitude, telling his brother and his family: '... let us go...' (Genesis 33:12 NKJ) However, Jacob held back, knowing the family he had brought with him needed to rest: 'You go on ahead!' ... He explained his reasoning to Esau: '...The children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me... if the men should drive them hard... the flock will die... I will lead on slowly at a pace... the livestock... and the children, are able to endure...' (Genesis 33:13-14 NKJ) Jacob wasnt snubbing his already-strained relationship with his brother for no good reason, he was being realistic about his own people's abilities to cope, he was keeping things in balance. Jacob refused to take on too much (even if it seemed the best way forward at the time) and risk neglecting his family and straining the weaker ones who depended on him.</p>
<p>The Bible says: 'Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others too.' (Philippians 2:4 NLT) People are God's priorities. What about you? Are you being wise with where you put your energy? Are you moving too quickly to spend proper time with your family or with your friends who need you? Or are you the sort who likes to push things along (not that that's always wrong!), and right now you're pushing someone too hard? Maybe it's time to wise up?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judges 4-6, Mark 10:13-22, Ps 88:9b-18, Pr 13:4-6<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... They could not dwell together.' Genesis 13:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Abraham and Lot were close partners in business. Then a problem arose: '...<em>Their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. And there was strife between the herdsmen...'</em><em> </em>(Genesis 13:6-7 NKJ) So Abraham said, <em>'Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right...'</em> (Genesis 13:9 NKJ) They realised the time had come to go their separate ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes friendships or relationships are only for certain seasons in your life and *newsflash* that's actually ok. The fact is, people change because of their experiences and the things that life throws at them. You may find that what was once a natural fit is a bit of a struggle now, doing more to damage you both than it is helping either of you.</p>
<p>Need some Bible tips on how to shape a good friendship? Here are five. (1) Proverbs 12:26 NIV - '<em>The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.'</em><em> </em>(2) Proverbs 13:20 NIV - '<em>Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.'</em><em> </em>(3) Proverbs 14:6-7 NIV - <em>'A mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning. Stay away from a fool for you will not find knowledge on their lips.'</em><em> </em>(4) Proverbs 22:24-25 NIV - <em>'Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared.'</em><em> </em>(5) 1 Corinthians 15:33 NIV - <em>'Do not be misled:</em> <em>Bad company corrupts good character.'</em><em> </em>So, how are your friendships looking? Today, ask God's opinion on them. Pray with your Bible open next to you, ask Him and listen.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.' 1 John 5:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>What the devil thought was his biggest victory - the death of Jesus - was actually God's greatest triumph! Victory over death! 'Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?' That's God 1, devil 0. God's won and we're on the right team. You don't have to win or come up with all the answers on your own or in your own strength. If you find yourself doing that you may not yet fully trust your Dad in Heaven to 'win' for you.</p>
<p>David said, 'Through You we push back our enemies; through Your name we trample our foes.' (Psalm 44:5 NIV) Faith is only as valuable as the thing it's placed in, and our faith should be in a God who never fails. Fact: we invest our lives where we invest our love. So: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind.' (Luke 10:27 NIV) Jesus said, 'I have given you authority to...overcome all the power of the enemy...' (Luke 10:19 NIV) Paul said, 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.' (Romans 8:35-37 NIV)</p>
<p>Believe the truth about who you are in Christ. Know that you, through Christ, are fully equipped and in a place to overcome.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judges 9:34-11:40, Mark 10:35-52, Ps 129, Pr 20:25, Ecc 5:4-6<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... Stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for [you]...' 2 Corinthians 10:13 GNT</p>
<p>Let's get something straight. <em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>N</em><em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>obody</em> is good at everything and <em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>nobody</em> is called to do everything. God has given each of us clearly defined roles in life. Paul understood that his job wasn't to achieve everything or try to please everyone, but to focus on what God had called and equipped <em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>him</em> to do: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' You want to be successful? You'll only manage it if you're doing what God wants you to (and, though it's sometimes opposite to the world's definition of success, God's is the only one worth considering in the long run).</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled: Satan will try to rob you of the joy of serving God by getting you to compare yourself with Brainy McSmarts, some celebrity Barbie-lookalike or even, for us Christians, some seemingly perfect super-saint in church. Satan loves pressuring you to fit into the expectations of others. Don't do it! (Insert slow-motion: <em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>'Nooooooo...'</em>) You'll always find someone who <em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>seems</em> to be doing a better job than you, and you'll become discouraged.</p>
<p>God's calling for your life is completely different from theirs: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' The Bible says: 'Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.' (Galatians 6:4 NLT) John Bunyan, author of the Christian classic, <em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>Pilgrim'</em><em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;>s Progress</em>, wrote: 'If my life is fruitless it doesn't matter who praises me. And if my life is fruitful it doesn't matter who criticises me.' So, just do what God's called you to do!</p>

<title><![CDATA[Why Have Courage?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[why-have-courage]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Ever been in situations where courage just comes naturally to you? Usually, you're more likely to take heart and go for it if there's likely to be a worthwhile outcome to a situation.</p>
<p>Look at all the amazing things the disciples did in the book of Acts. Where did they find the motivation to preach to hostile crowds and face prison, beatings and rejection from their families? Obviously they knew that Jesus had their back. But it must be more than that! Here's the core of the matter: they knew that having the courage to do great, faith-inspired things would draw them so much nearer to Him their friend and companion, the God of the universe. They felt so moved to step out for Him that all other things faded in comparison. Wanting to honour God and to get closer to Him in relationship were things so precious to them that they would do anything short of sin to gain them. There's no other reason for courage in the Christian walk than these.</p>
<p>God's both behind us and before us - He's set us free so that we can have the courage to go to Him, and He stands ahead beckoning us towards Him in glorious relationship. Let's pluck up the nerve to take a risk for Him. Trusting in Him to come through for us, and then seeing Him do so, is a deep and satisfying interaction. It's like nothing else. Having courage and faith is pointless without anchoring it in Jesus - engaging in relationship with Him is the point of it all. If that's something you haven't done yet, perhaps now is the time!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 25-27, Mark 8:1-13, Ps 44:9-16, Pr 12:10-11<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go...' Matthew 14:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you find yourself in the middle of hard times or trouble, do you sometimes think, 'I must have done something wrong - perhaps I've missed God's will and He's punishing me'? No. Troubles can come from all over the place and usually have nothing to do with our wrongdoing or God's punishment.</p>
<p>Think about Jesus' disciples caught in the storm at sea. The disciples weren't in the storm by disobeying, but by obeying Jesus; not by rejecting God's will, but by embracing it. The Bible says, 'Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go...' - and they obeyed. Doing the right thing is not always the easiest thing. It can often mean going against the grain of what everyone else is doing or thinking by staying away from what's popular, easy or selfish. When that happens, here are some helpful lessons from the disciples' experience: (1) Obedience doesn't mean there won't be storms along the way. The disciples had just witnessed Jesus' handiwork with the loaves and fishes - you'd think they'd be bursting with faith. But when fear comes knocking, faith can take a nosedive. Jesus had told them He'd meet them on the other shore yet they forgot His miracle-working power and His promise and gave in to anxiety. God may not solve your problem in the way you want, but you can be sure He will show up in the middle of it. (2) Having fear doesn't mean you're a failure. It's just a reminder that you're human, and, like the disciples, you've forgotten Who has the power and Who's in charge. And these are lessons that transform your trial into triumph.</p><br /><br />SoulFood Mothers Day: Gal 5:22, Luke 19:11-26, Ps 36:5-9, Heb 10:19-23<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was... buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.' Matthew 14:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>There's a great little saying that goes like this: 'When you can't trace His hand, you can trust His heart.' It's a good thing to remember when you feel that God might have abandoned you. We can't always see precisely what God's doing to work all things together for good. But we are called to, walk by faith, not by sight. (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJ)</p>
<p>Where was Jesus while the disciples were freaking out on the water and fear was sloshing into their hearts? Actually, He was up a mountain praying for them. He wasn't taking a siesta. At every stage He was their mediator and their need meet-er and He's ours too. 'He always lives to intercede for [you].' (Hebrews 7:25 NIV) Can you imagine Jesus praying to the Father for His fear-filled mates in the boat? And can you imagine the Father refusing to answer His prayers? Never! 'The Spirit Himself intercedes for us...' (Romans 8:26 NIV) With both Jesus and the Holy Spirit talking to the Father on your behalf, your victory is guaranteed. (2) Between the command to 'Go' and your safe arrival on the other side, there's often a crisis. Jesus told them to cross to the other shore, but before they got there they were well shaken. What's shaking your life today - loss, guilt, loneliness, money problems, illness, addiction, rejection? When our faith is low and our fear high, we cry, 'If only I had (or hadn't)... If only I could...' Learn to trust God. It's not over until He says so. And He hasnt!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 28-29, Mark 8:14-26, Ps 44:17-26, Pr 12:12-14<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'God is... a very present help in trouble.' Psalm 46:1 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Picture it one more time - a boat lashed by huge waves, 12 frightened disciples who thought they were going under. They forgot to look for Jesus to rescue them. Yet as the night advanced and things looked hopeless, '...Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.' (Matthew 14:25 NKJ) Did they rejoice? No, their fear intensified and they said, '...It's a ghost!' (Matthew 14:26 NKJ)</p>
<p>Your fear can distort your perceptions and make you see the answer as just another problem. Often what appears a threat is actually a blessing about to be revealed. Look to Jesus in your time of fear; when He takes away the lesser it's always to give you the greater.</p>
<p>Very often, God's best requires facing something you fear. Jesus called Peter to come to Him. Deciding it was safer in the storm with Jesus than in the boat without Him, Peter took the plunge. But there's always a moment after you step out in faith when you hear, 'What if Im not up to this?' Peter heard it, and the waves began to engulf him. Panicked, he called and Jesus immediately rescued him. Peter wasn't drowning; he was learning and growing! When you walk by faith, even your failures will lead to success. So step out with Jesus; He won't let you drown. Rely on God more today. Do something today that's way out of your comfort zone - maybe it's offering to pray for someone's healing or giving your testimony.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Proverbs 16:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>It seems like too good to be true, doesn't it? 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Now, it doesn't say, 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed at once.' <em>Or without any effort on your part. Or without any mistakes along the way</em>. God didn't say you wouldn't stumble. He just promises to pick you up when you do, dust you off, correct you when you need it and keep on keeping on with you. 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly... Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.' (Psalm 37: 23-24 NLT) So don't get bent out of shape when things don't work out perfectly - by God's grace, you're still heading towards the goal He's helping you achieve. Remember: God can bring good out of bad situations. Out of the ashes of a disaster, He can create astonishing beauty. (That's one of the reasons why He's God!) 'God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.'(Romans 8:28 NLT) So, don't give up if you're hitting struggles and setbacks. Success awaits those who do not give up!</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Be it known...that we will not...' Daniel 3:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>All through life you'll come across people who will try to control you. Their threats can sound real, and the consequences of ignoring them, intimidating. Look at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their commitment to God landed them in a fiery furnace hotter than the inside of a volcano. But it also promoted them to a place of huge blessing and influence. Their story in Daniel 3 teaches us that in a real test of character the outcome is not in your hands. You make the choice to do what is right before God and leave the consequences to Him. It's a trial by fire, but it's a fire of refinement, and on the other side of it you come out stronger. Each time you do the right thing, choosing to walk rather than escape the path God has called you on, you enter a new level of freedom. And as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego discovered, three things happen: (1) You are set free from the 'Nebuchadnezzars' who claim to have control over the outcome of your life. (2) You are set free to say 'no' to those who would try to use and manipulate you. (3) You are set free to serve your all-powerful King and say 'no' to all the other pretenders who really have no power over you at all. In that moment you not only gain insight into who you are, but more importantly, Whose you are. And God will do one of two things: develop you in the fiery furnace or deliver you from it. He may even do both!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Be it known...that we will not ...' Daniel 3:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>Wonder what the final thoughts of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were as they were carried towards the furnace? Perhaps there were a few last flashes of doubt as they were dragged to the ovens. Did Shadrach think, 'Nobody else is risking martyrdom - why should I?' Or what about Meshach? 'Better a live dog than a dead lion. If we stay alive, maybe we can do good for God and for others?' Possibly Abednego wavered as the heat began to warm his cheeks, 'Where are You, Lord?'<br /><br />Doubt, reason, self-pity can all impinge on our journey of faith, rightly or wrongly. But what's so commendable about this situation is that neither logic, nor emotion, nor circumstance could separate these Hebrew boys from their conviction in God. They were prepared to die for what they believed.<br /><br />If you want a faith that goes down in history (whether that's earth's history books or Heaven's scrolls!), you'll need a priority list that has 'God' written at  Number 1. God must be the ruler of logic, fear, situation, danger - the lot. These guys put their faith on the line in the public domain with everyone watching. The result: a whole nation turned its heart back to God.<br /><br />Paul said, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:13 NKJ) So if the spotlight ever turns on you, do you want to be able to stand strong with God? Those who answered 'yes' had best get ready for the flames. In your prayer times today, ask God to increase your capacity to grow and your capacity to cope.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['David inquired again of God...' 1 Chronicles 14:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Picture this: the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army holds a phone to his ear. The enemy's closing in. Fighter jets are tearing through the sky. Battleships are moving in. And still the Prime Minister refuses to act. 'Prime Minister, this is a red alert,' the head of the army bawls into the phone. 'If we don't fight back now; Australia will be enemy-occupied territory. When do you want us to issue orders to attack?' 'Not yet,' a cool-headed PM replies. 'Then when?' There is a pause, as if the PM is listening to a higher power. 'When you hear the sound of leaves rustling in the treetops - then you will know it is the moment to move. Then and only then, give the signal!' </p>
<p>Yeah, right! Yet David does almost exactly this in 1 Chronicles 14 (check it out for yourself). So attuned to God is this giant-slayer that he is willing to ignore all danger signs in favour of an odd piece of strategy, dreamed up through prayer. David gets his victory because he will not make a move without first consulting God. David waited upon a sound. He knew the voice of God so well he could recognise it in the movement of mulberry bushes. David put faith over logic. He knew God would not fail him - the real question was, would he fail God? </p>
<p>Bottom line: When God speaks (compare His words with the Bible to check it sounds like Him!), no matter how bizarre the request, follow it through. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Hebrews 2:10 CEV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Pain is a learning experience. A friend cheats on us, an illness steals our youth, a parent abandons us - none of us escapes pain. Even 'Jesus...had to suffer before He could learn what it really means to obey God.' (Hebrews 5:8 CEV) </p>
<p>Philip Yancey writes: 'God understood physical pain, having designed the marvellous nervous system that warns against harm... In thirty-three years on earth Jesus learned about hardship, rejection and betrayal. And He learned too about pain: what it feels like to have an accuser leave the red imprint of his fingers on your face...to have a crude iron spike pounded through muscle, tendon, and bone. On earth, the Son of God learned all that.' </p>
<p>Jesus took His degree in suffering. A lone man abandoned by His friends, nailed naked on a cross - at one point He even feels abandoned by God. Everything He has lived for seemed lost. And when we cry at the storm clouds, 'God, where are You?' we know Jesus has been there too. By joining us on earth, Jesus gave visible, historical proof that God hears our groans and groans along with us. Suffering isn't the last word, resurrection is. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Hebrews 2:10 CEV<br /><br /><p>The angel of death passed over every home smeared with lamb or goat blood. Yet that was specific to that particular story in the Bible (find it in Exodus 12). Cancer doesn't skip your house just because there's a 'Shalom' sign hung on the wall. Debt doesn't leave you alone just because there is a Christian fish sticker on your car bumper. Weekly attendance at church doesn't send suffering an 'excuse me' note. The best of us will have our dose of pain. It's part and parcel of the ride. </p>
<p>Jesus gives Peter a verbal slap-on-the-wrist when he suggests that Christ should not suffer, 'Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block...you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men...If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself...take up his cross.' (Matthew 16:23-24 NIV) Harsh words. But let's not be surprised when misery knocks on our door. Jesus has promised it. God uses suffering to make us more Christ-like. 'It was good that I had to suffer in order to learn Your laws.' (Psalm 119:71 GWT) Remember, it's by His wounds we are healed (Isaiah 53:5) and by His weakness that we are made strong.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Keep your conscience clear...' 1 Timothy 1:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Paul insists we know the difference between right and wrong. No matter what advantages there are in twisting our sense of right, Paul warns us to stay God's side of the fence. He lays it on the line to Timothy: 'Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.' </p>
<p>Now, a captain doesn't set out to wreck his ship. But if he falls asleep at the wheel or takes his eye off the compass, he will end up on the rocks anyway. The question is not, 'Can I get away with it?' No, the question is, 'Can I live with it afterwards? How will it affect my confidence before God? How does He feel about it? Who am I trying to please?' </p>
<p>In Romans 14:23 NLT, he gives another warning: 'But if people have doubts about whether they should [do] something, they shouldn't [do] it. They would be condemned for not acting in faith before God. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.' After all what good is it to receive everybody's respect but not deserve it? Keep your life clean and clear before God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cross-examine me, O Lord...' Psalm 26:2 TLB<br /><br /><p>There's a story about a guy named Bill. He phoned his boss and said: 'I believe you're looking for an experienced, talented, hard-working manager for your office. I'd like to apply for the position.' The boss replied, 'We already have someone in that job and he's excellent. By the way, your voice sounds familiar. Do I know you?' The guy replied, 'It's me Bill; I was just checking up on myself!' </p>
<p>Just like Bill, you need to check up on yourself regularly. You need to invite God to cross-examine every detail of your case, scrutinise the facts, expose any corruption and get to the truth, no matter how deep He has to dig. </p>
<p>When we invite the Holy Spirit to scrutinise us, He makes us aware of the stuff that doesn't add up. The dirty secrets we'd like to keep dead and buried rise to the top. Confronted with our darkness and sin, we have some options: to justify why we did it or to ask God to deal with it. </p>
<p>The Psalmist prayed: 'I have tried to keep Your laws and have trusted You without wavering. Cross-examine me, O Lord...test my motives and affections too. For I have taken Your loving-kindness and Your truth as my ideals.' (Psalm 26:1-3 TLB) It may not be nice facing up to our sin but it certainly benefits us. Confession opens up forgiveness. And forgiveness sets a prisoner free: you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Proverbs 16:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>By now, you've probably been warned a few times about the perils and pitfalls of making a bad decision. And that's wise.</p>
<p>But sometimes paralysis - just sitting there and not making that all-important decision - can be just as risky. Picture a donkey standing between two bales of hay, unable to decide which one to eat and afraid of making the wrong choice. Eventually he just starves to death!</p>
<p>So how can you avoid being an ass? (1) <em>Stop trying to please everybody</em>. 'Fear of man is a dangerous trap, but to trust in God means safety.' (Proverbs 29:25 TLB) Once you know God's will, don't be thrown off track by others. (2) <em>When God is on your side, you'll succeed</em>. Fear of failure can stop you going places but fear is just an emotion. God's Word, on the other hand, is unshakeable: 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' (Proverbs 16:3 NIV) (3) <em>Stay in tune, stay on track</em>. As long as you keep close to God in prayer, your steps can't fail. 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.' (John 8:12 NIV) So pray!</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.' Romans 10:17 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Millions of people around the world foolishly depend on horoscopes for their daily dose of wisdom. They see the Bible as old and outdated and so would rather put their trust in an unknown group of people who'll interpret the movements of exploding spheres of gas zillions of kilometres away to advise them on whether they'll have a good or bad day.</p>
<p>Trust a bunch of strangers or turn to God? Tough choice! There is so much wisdom in the Bible and you don't even need special training (although that's a good idea too). You can start simply by opening it. In it you'll find the stories of God's dealings with people throughout history. It's a book that has repeatedly proven helpful in grounding, correcting and inspiring countless people for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The latest celebrity songsters may have the odd clever sound byte, but will we be combing the lyrics of pop-stars for life guidance in two thousand years time? True, the Bible is longer than the average song. But, did you know it is possible to read the entire New Testament in a month by reading just nine chapters every day? No more excuses - get stuck into your Bible!</p>
<p>Here's a helpful checklist: (1) Find a translation that floats your boat. (2) Don't use it as a lucky dip - have a systematic plan. (3) Follow the plan but don't have a guilt trip if you miss a day. If you start SoulFood today, you'll have read your whole Bible in a year. (4) Expect that God will speak to you.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...To equip God's people to do His work...' Ephesians 4:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>'The church is full of hypocrites besides, it's your relationship with God that counts.'</p>
<p>While it's true that, ultimately, your relationship with God is what counts God has put His Spirit in each of us, and as Christians, we are given the amazing gift of partaking 'in the divine nature.' (2 Peter 1:4 ESV) Part of what that means is that when Christians gather together, we experience the presence of Christ by being a part of His Body. Yup - the Bible's straight up about calling the Church 'Christ's Body'. And God tells us plainly to 'love Me, love My Church'. That's because the Church is the God-chosen, God-inspired, God-lived-in plan for the world.</p>
<p>If you think you're too good for the Church, you may have some serious pride issues to talk to God about. The word 'Church' is today's version of the Greek word 'ekklesia' in the New Testament: <i>assembly</i>. That means <i>meeting</i> <i>together as a group</i>. It's hard to assemble on your own - imagine how disappointing <i>The</i> <i>Avengers</i> would've been if only <i>Captain America </i>turned up! God works through us as a people. Everyone plays their part. When the disciples faced a hungry crowd who'd spent the day listening to Jesus, they were a bit put out when Jesus sent the ball back into their court saying, '<i>You </i>feed them.' (Mark 6:37 NLT) It's the same for your church. If there are needs in your church that aren't being met, why not try and meet them yourself! Your leader's job is to, 'equip God's people to do His work and build up the Church, the body of Christ.' (Ephesians 4:12 NLT) So roll up your sleeves and get stuck in - you are the Church!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Therefore, pray...Our Father in Heaven...' Matthew 6:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The disciples genuinely wanted to get close to God, but they didn't always know how. However they did know Jesus would hold the key. Their request has left us the most beautiful prayer ever. (1) <em>'Our Father in Heaven.'</em> When you say, 'Father' you're acknowledging that you're 'family', that you have a special relationship with God which entitles you to go to Him at any time, confident you're loved, welcomed and assured of His favour. When you say, 'in Heaven,' you can go no higher. You're putting your request to the ultimate source of goodness, grace, mercy, provision, protection and authority. What a privilege! (2) <em>'Hallowed be Your name.'</em> (Matthew 6:9 NKJ) Whatever you do today, whether in thought, word or deed, let it honour God. People should be able to look at your life and want to become acquainted with the One you serve. (3)<em> 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.'</em> (Matthew 6:10 NKJ) Each time you choose to say no to yourself and yes to God's will, you demonstrate to a watching world what it means to live as a citizen of His Kingdom. Note the words, 'as it is in Heaven.' Is anyone in Heaven fearful or doubting? Stubborn or disobedient? Critical or negative? When you come across something that's contrary to God's will, you have the authority to rise up and say, 'If it's not done and approved in Heaven it has no place in my life here on earth.' The one thing Satan hopes you never discover is that you have the God-given authority to restrict his movements in your life.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Give us this day our daily bread...' Matthew 6:11 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Fresh bread mmm... that lovely smell that wafts from the bakery... Jesus taught, 'Give us this day our daily bread.' Notice the word 'daily'. That's because you can't fight today's battles on the strength of yesterday's bread. In the wilderness God's people were only permitted to collect enough manna for one day. If they tried to collect more, it rotted. It's wonderful to talk about what God did yesterday and what He's going to do tomorrow, but all you've got is today.<em> 'Give us this day our daily bread.'</em> What God's provided for you today is what you need to stand up to the challenges you face. This prayer is an expression of faith. The very act of asking shows you believe God's got what you need and that He cares enough to provide for you. It says, 'I don't need to go to anybody else but You, Lord.' So turn off your phone, computer and TV, shut the door, get down on your knees, approach God in faith and pray, 'Give me what I need for this day.' God knows what you need, you don't! And He'll provide for you today so you'll be able to handle whatever life throws at you.</p>
<p>If people start getting on your nerves for no apparent reason or you start having all sorts of mood swings or you find yourself living by <em>feelings</em> instead of <em>faith</em>, it's probably because you're not eating right. It's time to go back to your Source and say, 'Lord, I've come for my daily bread.'</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgive us...as we forgive...' Matthew 6:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>So far, so good with our trip through the Lord's Prayer. We've reminded ourselves that God is our Father and He wants what is best for us. We've thought about being dependent on our heavenly Father as He provides bread for us both physically and spiritually. And today Jesus asks us to think about speaking well of the people who have crushed and stamped on our hearts. </p>
<p>Sorry, run that last one by us again, Jesus? Surely you mean us to pray for God to send a lightning bolt to zap our enemies, right? Surely there's a typo in your words, 'Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors'? We can live with the first bit - we've run up enormous debts against God, but He forgives us. But what's that about me forgiving that vermin who's ruined my life? Are you serious?! </p>
<p>Jesus majors on extending mercy to those who don't deserve it. After all, where would we be if God held a grudge? So Jesus wants us to practice letting go of our grudges. There is no resentment in Heaven and God wants us to start living like that now on earth. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you forgive the person who has wronged you. If you're feeling even braver, ask God to doubly bless them - that really is what Jesus loves!</p>

Matthew 6:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Our last look at the Lord's Prayer starts with a question: What do you pray when temptation is crawling up your collar? Answer: 'Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one...' (Matthew 6:13 NKJ)</p>
<p>It's not God who dangles the carrot of temptation: we have certain pulls and desires within us, and Satan wants to jump on them. Therefore we pray for God to save us from ourselves and to deliver us, or rescue us, from the evil one's exploitative traps. Here's the good news then: if we bring our weaknesses to God, not only does He work on our behalf; in the process we get closer to Him.</p>
<p>Paul had this one sussed: 'I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) Paul actually boasts - yes, boasts! - about his weaknesses: '...to keep me from being puffed up with pride...I was given a painful physical ailment, which acts as Satan's messenger to...keep me from being proud...' (2 Corinthians 12:7 GNT) You'll often find a weakness attached to strength, acting as a governor to keep you from becoming boastful or running ahead of God. Gideon chose 32,000 men to fight the Midianites, but God reduced his numbers to 300 (see Judges 7). Why? So that Israel would know it was God's power and not their own that saved them.</p>
<p>Your most painful area of weakness CAN become your area of greatest strength: so, pray into it, hard, and watch yourself walk more and more closely with God at the same time.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...No man ever spoke like this Man!' John 7:46 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The power of words: words can be like a mask you hide behind; words can set a spark in someone's heart; words can cut a scar into another; words can comfort; words can destroy; words send the tanks in; words sign the peace treaty; the world turns on words. It's no surprise then that John starts his Gospel off referring to Jesus as the Word of God. </p>
<p>Think for a second about the power of Jesus' words: ordinary uneducated fishermen sparked a revolution that is still unfolding today because of these words; monks would spend all night by candlelight turning over these words in their minds; slave-traders would unlock shackles at the force of these words; cathedrals, paintings, frescoes, poems, plays, books and films would shoot into existence inspired by these words; the Salvation Army would create a blueprint for the modern welfare system stirred by these words; alcoholics put down bottles, cancers pack their bags, addicts bin their needles - and all because of Jesus' words. </p>
<p>History shows that words change people. And words can change you too - if you let them. Which of Jesus words are your favourites? Journal them or write them in a place that you'll return to, and open yourself up to being changed by them. Then when you need inspiration, a pick-me-up, comfort, healing, truth or encouragement - choose one of those highlighted diamonds from the mind of Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have...put a wall of protection around him.' Job 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Job was at his wit's end. His body was in excruciating pain with scabs and broken flesh where disease had eaten away at him. He was exhausted from the sleepless nights when dark thoughts raced around his mind. Grief weighed down like a stone on his chest. His marriage was in tatters, his children all dead when they'd gone to a party and the roof had collapsed on them. </p>
<p>He'd obeyed God all his life. Surely that should have counted for something? Why was God punishing him? It didn't make sense. God had always protected him previously. But the situation was so bad, death couldn't be any worse.</p>
<p>At last, seemingly long overdue, God stepped into the picture, armed with healing and restoration. Finally, the breath of resurrection blew into the room. </p>
<p>And the same promise is for you when your world crumbles around you. When your mind, your health, or your relationships are attacked, the pain is raw and real. But it's only for a time. God won't allow more pain than you can possibly endure. Just when you think it's impossible to take any more, the breath of resurrection will blow into your room. God's promises are true. 'He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.' (Psalm 147:3 NIV) And... 'Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.' James 1:12 (NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he struck three times, and stopped.' 2 Kings 13:18 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Let's start with an unusual story from the Old Testament. A prophet of God came to the king of Israel who, at the time, was worried about losing in battle. The prophet told the king to get some arrows and strike the ground. Strange instructions! But the king gave up quickly: 'He struck it three times and stopped. The man of God was angry with him and said, &quot;You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated [the enemy] and completely destroyed it.&quot;'(2 Kings 13:18-19 NIV)</p>
<p>What's going on in this story? This message is simple: <i>How</i> you do something is as important as doing it. The means to an end are as important as the end itself. </p>
<p>What does this mean for us? God's priorities haven't changed, He desires obedience in every area of our lives. He is gracious with us, but it is in our best interests to listen to His instructions. And His instructions are simply this - to live our lives in love. Paul wrote, '...if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.' (1 Corinthians 13:2 ESV) If we live in love, we take the time to think deeply about the most Christ-like way forward. Love puts people first, above projects, above goals and tasks. It thinks about the means, not just the end. So, if you're worrying, or tempted to do something half-heartedly - stop! Take a step back and think about God's priorities. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This is the day the Lord has made.' Psalm 118:24 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Whatever happened yesterday, it's gone. It's finished. Whatever happens tomorrow is null and void because you're not there yet. Today is a brand spanking new day that God has made for us to enjoy. You can live your life in a whole new way by sticking with this attitude: scrap two days from your mind - yesterday and tomorrow - and just focus on today. </p>
<p>What's right in front of you today? Who can you bless? Can you learn patience, gentleness, kindness from your experiences, even in the next few hours? Will you look closely at what's in front of you each day? If you do, maybe you'll see familiar situations and people in a new light. You might find yourself starting to understand how you can make a difference. You'll even find that living the right way today takes care of a surprising amount of tomorrow. That old exhortation to 'seize the day' simply means taking a careful look at what's around you, who's near you, and what situations you're already involved in. Invest time and character into them, and you won't go to bed feeling like you've wasted the day. Look to help those around you, and look to God to help you with it; but don't be tempted to waste the day in couch potato land which, let's face it, usually leaves you feeling limper than warm lettuce. </p>
<p>In 1 Samuel 3:9 NLT, Eli told Samuel to say the most basic of prayers, 'Speak, Lord, Your servant is listening.' Pray that prayer, and focus on what God has to say to you today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I desire to do Your will, O my God.' Psalm 40:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here's one thing you can be sure of: God wants you to spend a large amount of time helping and blessing people. How could He not? Jesus, who had the best possible relationship with the Father, didn't just pop down to earth to complete His mission and scoot off. No, His journey to the cross followed on from a life of tremendous love and grace focused on others. We are called to live the same way. </p>
<p>Jesus said, 'If any of you wants to be My follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow Me. If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for My sake, you will save it.' (Matthew 16:24-25 NLT) </p>
<p>That's a tricky calling, and Christians can be easily distracted from it. It is possible to focus only on our own dreams and visions - the danger there is that if we go too far that way, we will puff up our ego, promote our self-importance and nothing more. Dreams and visions aren't worthy of your life if they don't bless others, and even a good dream can get in the way of valuing others. So, don't start with goals and targets. Focus first on loving God and loving others. Trust that God's a great driver with a great destination in mind for your life. He knows better than anyone what you've got to give and how best to use it. So while you're on that journey, <i>love</i>. This might mean scaling back on some of your commitments, or things you do often, in order to focus on God's 'first things first'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>No matter where an Australian embassy is located, the building and land it occupies is classed as sovereign to 'Australia'. Each embassy is a tiny Aussie outpost in a foreign country. Inside the embassies, government officials are on hand, ready to help out Aussie citizens living locally or to act on behalf of the Australian government in its international relations. When a foreign nation's leader summons the local Aussie ambassador for a meeting, that leader is talking to the official representative of the Prime Minister of Australia, and the Australian government. Ambassadors 'represent' in a very big way.</p>
<p>When we are 'in Christ', we are an example of Christ. That's big. There should be something different about us. Of course, we're a work-in-progress for Christ-likeness, so we're not the finished article yet. But we are supposed to represent Him, just like an ambassador. That means when people interact with us, we are the local representation or ambassador for Jesus. That's a huge responsibility and should mean people see a difference in the way we live and the way we behave. </p>
<p>When Paul says, 'be an example,' he is basically saying, 'When you talk about Jesus, people should actually see Jesus. Not just hear words <i>about</i> Him. Then they'll desire to know Him and be pulled to Him. When you talk about faith, the evidence of it in your life should be so compelling that they want to live by it.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in...speech...' 1 Timothy 4:12 GNT<br /><br /><p>It's all fine and dandy to be told to 'be an example'. But how, and where? Let's break it down over the next few days and look at a few different areas. We'll start with our speech.</p>
<p>Your words give voice to what's going on in your heart (see Matthew 12:34). And once the words have been said, there's no taking them back - spoken words are out there like a stubborn stain on our clothes and 'sorry' doesn't always work like <i>Vanish</i>. You may need to rebuild and repair the trust in your relationship. That can take time. </p>
<p>The Bible says: 'May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to You, O Lord.' (Psalm 19:14 NLT) This means that there should be a clear path from your transformed heart to your mouth. So chew on your words and figure out the taste of them before you let them out your mouth. Think them over. Christ's words brought life; do yours? Will your words swing towards war, or peace? </p>
<p>Sometimes we can be 'generally' good but fall down in our dealings with one or two specific people. If there's someone in your life you need to 'tame your tongue' around, study the book of Proverbs about the power of words. Try Proverbs 21:23, 25:23, 29:20 for starters. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in conduct...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>How we act tells other people just who we're listening to. Look at the story of Noah in the Bible. He set about building an ark of mammoth proportions to save his family and all the species living on the earth. All around him were people who thought he'd utterly lost it! Still, he chose not to listen to them. He carried on listening to God, and his actions eventually saved the lives of his whole family. </p>
<p>But that wasn't the end of the story. Noah's character really shone through immediately <i>after</i> the flood. The first thing he did when it was all over was to build an altar to the Lord to show how grateful he was. An altar, even before a home. He gave thanks before doing anything else. We all have homes, we're provided with food, air, and a ground to walk on; but many of us don't even make time to say thanks to God.  '...all our busy rushing ends in nothing.' (Psalm 39:6 NLT) So let gratitude shape the way you live your life. The Bible says, 'Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.' (Romans 12:2 NLT).  Jesus tells us that our life is filled with examples of God's care for us. (See Matthew 6:28-34) </p>
<p>Everything beautiful begins with God. Every good thing in your life has its start in Him. Recognise the gifts from God in your life. There is enough time today for you to give Him thanks. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in love...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In all honesty, it's hard to find all people lovable, all the time. Disillusioned with people? We all can be, and that's simply because people are difficult.</p>
<p>A pastor of a big church tells a story of a time when he was stuck in a lift with a very drunk, vomiting man. Eager to get out of the situation as fast as possible, the pastor made his escape and walked back to his room, all the while mentally criticising the guy. But that night, God spoke to him about it. He said, 'You laughed at him, but I loved him enough to die for him.' Ouch. Relying on our willpower to love others isn't enough, because it will fail us, and those around us. We're left with no other choice here - we must connect to God's source of love. The same love that died for 'the least' and 'the worst', and treated them as human beings, not things. 'Love means doing what God has commanded us, and He has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.' (2 John 1:6 NLT) Matthew 5:43-44 shows us the radical way Jesus asks us to treat people: <i>love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you</i>. Ask God to speak to you about specific people in your life and pray for the ability to live this out towards them. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in spirit...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In New Testament times the religious people would often look down on the non-religious, thinking they were beneath them.  </p>
<p>It's upsetting to be treated with contempt, and that's how Jesus' disciples felt when they were turned away from a Samaritan village, just for being Jewish. As Jesus' nearest and dearest, you might have expected them to respond with humility and forgiveness. Not quite - the story in Luke 9 records the disciples asking Jesus for a vengeful jet of fire from Heaven! </p>
<p>But Jesus fired this back at them: 'You do not know what...spirit you are of.' (Luke 9:54-55 NKJ) They thought they were doing what God would have wanted, or at least asking for something to please Him. But they weren't. Jesus told them they were missing the mark big time. So we too should take a closer look at how we respond to people. Do we want immediate vengeance if we're insulted? Are we really responding with God's Spirit? God's Spirit is one of unbroken forgiveness, unusual kindness, and wide, wide mercy. It always focuses on the good of others. And it has the bigger picture in mind, too: Jesus said, 'Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake. Rejoice... your reward is great in Heaven.' (Luke 6:22-23 NKJ) It's difficult to instantly love your enemies but we can start by including them in our prayers.  </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in faith...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It can be easy to sit back and switch off your critical faculties in your uni lecture or even at church and automatically accept every word being said is true. <i>'They're the experts, they've written the textbook, they're in the pulpit - they must know what they're on about, right?'</i> </p>
<p>But who and what do you ultimately put your faith in? As much as we should respect our God-given leaders, we should never assume they are right all the time. Every human makes mistakes, and your lecturer or pastor should be the first to admit that for themselves! Our faith comes from Jesus. So we ultimately put our faith in Him<i>, </i>not a human being. If we're unsure about something, we have the right to go back to God, read the Bible and check it out. It's ok (in fact, it's very good!) to question things that don't seem right to you - if you keep praying to God and talking to wise people, what is true will stick. </p>
<p>The Christians in the city of Berea didn't just take Paul's word for it, they 'received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.' (Acts 17:11 NKJ) Let's do this! Sermons and books are important, but God's Word is our ultimate benchmark. So, whenever you hear something in a lecture or sermon you're not sure about, make a note of it in your journal and check it against the Bible. Get into the habit of 'searching the Scriptures' and weighing up what you hear.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in purity...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'So I bought this t-shirt with <i>Purity</i> written in gold, this silver ring that says <i>Say No To Lust</i> and this amazing worship CD called <i>Pure Praise</i> which just makes me want to meditate on God's pure love for me and my new found purity in Him. I'm now pretty much totally purified. Pure pure pure. Only problem is, when I left the shop my eye and my mind wandered off again...' </p>
<p>We can put on or buy a whole heap of stuff to make us feel pure, but really we are pure only by Jesus' blood. Nothing else. Living in this truth, we need to set our minds on all that pleases Him. Regular Bible reading, particularly in the New Testament, helps us pin down the things we need ask God's forgiveness for. 'Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is.' (Romans 12:2 NIV) Don't let yourself separate the spiritual challenge from the physical challenge in that verse: this is a whole-life transformation; it's about every bit of you. It describes the change in you, and should change all of you. Ask God to show you where you're still fitting into worldly patterns and praise Him for His transforming power.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Nor give place to the devil.' Ephesians 4:27 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In every person's life Satan is looking for opportunities as he lurks behind the scenes trying to take centre stage. And just like the pantomime villain, Satan himself has many disguises. It says in the Bible he can morph into 'an angel of light.' (2 Corinthians 11:14 NKJ) But whatever appealing things Satan may offer up on his platter, his endgame is always the same: 'to steal and kill and destroy.' (John 10:10 NIV) Destroy what? You name it: peace of mind, destiny, relationships... </p>
<p>Satan may be waiting in the wings of our lives, but the good news is you have power and authority to resist him and rest in the victory over him that Christ has won. How? In three ways: (1) Don't fear him. 'The Lord will keep you from all harm11 - He will watch over your life.' (Psalm 121:7 NIV) Throughout the New Testament, it says we are 'in Christ'. For Satan to get to you, He needs to get through God first! (2) Don't give Satan room. Laying down the welcome mat for him to wipe his feet in your thought life won't help. Sinful thoughts usually come before sinful actions. So, just as you have been placed 'in Christ', be sure to remind yourself that Jesus is living inside of you. Keep close to Him in prayer. (3) Take charge of your actions. Choose a verse to learn by heart, so that when sinful thoughts come to mind, you make a habit of replacing them straight away with ones fit for our King. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Always abounding in the work of the Lord.' 1 Corinthians 15:58 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Abounding is an old-fashioned word, but it simply means 'overflowing'. Outside of our life in Jesus, we are abounding with sin. There are no boundaries there, we rule by our own impulses and desires. We are kings of our own private jungles, rather than living and working for the King of Kings. </p>
<p>If that felt like a trip down memory lane for you, it wasn't meant to make you feel guilty, but grateful. It's good to remember how far you've come since Jesus took over your life, and keep in mind where God has brought you to. Because what was His solution for your sin? Abounding grace: 'Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.' (Romans 5:20 NKJ) Amazing. Really, <i>amazing.</i> God welcomed you into His amazing family with open arms rather than an angry heart, and showered you with love and blessings.</p>
<p><i>What should be my response to that?</i> How would you react if you were welcomed into a warm, kind family? Sit down. Rest. God's deepest desire is not that you run around serving Him (He doesn't need you to!), but that you would let Him love you. When you live like that, in His abounding grace, you'll then naturally want to 'abound in the work of the Lord'! You'll be able to serve '...enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.' (1 Corinthians 15:58 NLT) So today <b><i>serve</b></i> in an enthusiastic response to His love. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not worry...' Matthew 6:31 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'Don't worry, be happy!' isn't always the most practical piece of advice. But imagine if we could actually exterminate worry from our minds completely. It must be possible for us not to worry, because it's a command from Jesus: 'Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life.' (Matthew 6:25 NIV) And God doesn't set us up to fail in this instance. Quite the opposite - in these sorts of things, He sets us up to be conquerors. </p>
<p>So here's a practical step to help you along. If we're going to quit our worrying, we can't just leave a gaping hole where worry has been. The secret is to replace it with God's Word and turn our worries into prayers. If you've said or done something that you really regret and wish you hadn't, what should you do? </p>
<p>The answer is to pray for forgiveness, while trusting that God can work all things for good. He promises to do that, and also to help you learn from it. For example, if you're worried about having said something you shouldn't, instead of letting your worries tumble on and on all day, pray that God will prepare that person's heart for the next time you see them, and ask that it can be mended. You'll come out of it all a wiser person, and you might even get a better friendship out of it. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus was...tempted...' Matthew 4:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Here are two questions answered in the story of Jesus' temptation. </p>
<p>Question 1 - <i>Are some people immune to temptation?</i> Well, if Jesus was tempted, we've got no chance of getting away from it! Temptation is just one of those things that comes with being human. But Jesus did overcome it, and so we can too. The answer is not just to pray for it to go away, '<i>Lord, please take away all temptations so I can merrily skip from moment to moment, with nothing ever getting in the way!'</i> No, Satan used all manner of ways and means to tempt Jesus, and you'll get the same treatment. Being tempted doesn't mean you're not in the will of God. It may mean that Satan (or his cronies) is nipping at your heels to stop you. So, 'Put on the full armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.' (Ephesians 6:11 NIV) </p>
<p>Question 2 - <i>When are you most likely to be tempted?</i> Jesus was tempted just after His baptism, where Heaven opened and God publicly announced the arrival of His Son. If God appears to be moving in your life, don't think you've suddenly got it all together - that could be the perfect moment for the enemy to move in. Rather, sudden and unwanted temptation may be a sign you are growing closer to God! After the devil tried and failed to defeat Jesus we read, 'Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee...' (Luke 4:14 NKJ) And you will too! As you read the story of full story Jesus' temptation in Matthew 4, notice the importance of knowing Scripture like Jesus did.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each one is tempted...' James 1:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Satan took a special trip out into the wilderness to tempt Jesus to obey him. He even used the Word of God to attack three 'hotspots' of human nature: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Need</i>: 'If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.' (Matthew 4:3 NIV) This taps into one of our biggest fears - that if we don't look after ourselves, no one else will. Jesus had been fasting for forty days. Satan went straight in for what he hoped would be His biggest weakness. (2) <i>Protection</i>: 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: &quot;He will command His angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands.&quot;' (Matthew 4:5-6 NIV) This hits another fear: will God protect us? The truth is laid out in the Psalms: '...in the day of trouble He will keep me safe in His dwelling.' (Psalm 27:5 NIV) (3) <i>Power</i>: 'The devil...showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. &quot;All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from Me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.'&quot;' (Matthew 4:8-10 NIV)</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with wanting our needs to be met, wanting protection, or being in a position of authority! God is sovereign over it all. But what <i>is</i> dangerous, is looking for them from other people and other places, rather than from God alone. Jesus' response to temptation (Matthew 4:1-11) is to always bring His attention back to God and that's a pattern for us to follow. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life...' 1 John 2:16 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Lust is not confined to just a <i>sexual</i> thing. <i>Lust</i> can describe anything we are obsessed with - anything that consumes our thoughts in a way that's not holy. It can be broken down into three categories: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride. 'When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (lust of the flesh), that it was pleasant to the eyes (lust of the eyes), and a tree desirable to make one wise (pride), she took of its fruit.' (Genesis 3:6 NKJ) </p>
<p>Lust of the flesh is a desire for anything you'd throw all your money away on, take for your own gain or would rob your integrity. Lust of the eyes is about wanting such a visual feast you abandon any self-control. Dwell on that desire too long and by the time you're thinking clearly, you could be saying goodbye to valuable relationships and opportunities. Pride is when we look at ourselves rather than God for success - when we're right and everyone else is wrong, when we blame others rather than taking any responsibility. </p>
<p>So those are three very different kinds of temptation, and our strategy should always be the same: bolt the doors; don't be tempted to take a peek. The life God has for you is broader, better and kinder to you. But you won't see it if you're stuck in temptation. Sometimes we need to go as far as setting up physical boundaries to stop into losing to temptation. For example, could you set up an accountability buddy to receive emails of what you've been looking at on the internet? (www.x3watch.com has a paid (or free) email accountability system.)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Is anything too hard for God? It can be easy for your head to answer 'no', but try asking your heart what it thinks. It's not what your mind says, but what you actually <i>do,</i> that proves what you believe.</p>
<p>When God decided that Moses would lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, Moses never questioned God's ability, he just questioned whether God could do it through him. What was God's answer when Moses complained that he wasn't an articulate speaker? 'Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.' (Exodus 4:12 NIV) There's far more He wants to do through you than what you've already experienced. Your future can be bigger - so much bigger.</p>
<p>The problem is we get attached to methods which worked in the past. So we keep going back to them. But by always looking to the familiar, we limit God. He's much greater than any proven method, and He's never predictable. Jesus is known as the Living Word for a reason. God wants to whisper in your ear things you've not yet heard or seen, so have high expectations of God, and respond with faith to what He tells you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Imagine a house fire. Every object you once treasured is now crumbling ashes, lost forever. Can you imagine that kind of devastation? Paul describes our day of judgment before God to be like this: 'Fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.' (1 Corinthians 3:13-15 NIV) </p>
<p>Are you holding on to things on earth that can't possibly remain in Heaven, for the sake of looking good or impressing your friends? God gave us the inbuilt capacity to disobey Him but remember, that means you're in danger of experiencing great loss instead of great reward one day. </p>
<p>In the New Testament, Paul says this about his life: 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day.' (2 Timothy 4:7-8 NIV) That's a much greater reward than any appreciation or approval we can get from those around us! Today's passage from 1 Corinthians gives us a good mental picture of getting our priorities in order. Often what we value most is what we spend most of our free time on. Does this match up with what God says we should value?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.' Philippians 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you're not moving closer to your dream, maybe you're not pursuing it tenaciously enough. It's not necessarily about working harder at the same things, but more about being willing to change. Change what? (1)<i>Your thinking</i>. Are you telling yourself you can't succeed? Do you talk about yourself and what you're doing with words like &quot;I can't...&quot; or &quot;I'm not...&quot;? Afraid to get started, or afraid to take the next step because you don't have everything you need? You need to change your words and break the cycle of negative thinking. (2) <i>Your perspective</i>. Do you have a short-term way of thinking? Are you expecting success in days, weeks, or months? The greater the assignment, the longer it's likely to take. So recalibrate your expectations and create a new timetable. Otherwise, you'll be banging you head in frustration and defeat. That's not God's will for you. Paul's desire was '...that I may finish my race with joy...' (Acts 20:24 NKJV) God wants you to experience joy in the pursuit of your goal. (3) <i>Your ways</i>. How are things going in your personal life and at home? Are you ready to deal with the habits and hang-ups that stand between you and success? What steps can you take today to bring you closer to your dream - no matter how small? Author and publisher Robert Collier says, 'Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If another believer is overcome...help that person.' Galatians 6:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>It's ok to confront somebody you believe is in the wrong, but it's not ok to do it with a self-righteous attitude. When the church leaders insisted a woman '...caught in the act of adultery' be stoned (John 8:4 NLT), Jesus replied, '...let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone.' (John 8:7 NLT) Ouch! Lisa Harper writes: '...have we appointed ourselves the &quot;moral police&quot; to justify examining the blemishes in everyone else's behaviour? Is our ultimate goal to help restore prodigals, or do we have a hidden agenda to elevate ourselves by condemning those around us?... I've been confronted twice by other Christians, the first was a red-faced stranger who was furious with me for wearing knee-high leather boots with a short skirt to her church. She called me a &quot;Jezebel&quot;. The second was a good friend who tenderly pointed out my pride in a specific situation. The name-calling left a bruise on my soul; the compassionate rebuke turned me toward the forgiving arms of our Heavenly Father.' God alone has the perfect combination of holiness and mercy to stand in judgment of the human heart. The Bible says, 'If another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.' 'The only One who was worthy to condemn us, chose instead to pardon us. Before you to confront someone who's messed up, remember you too are only saved by grace, so make sure all your words come from an honest, compassionate and humble heart.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Run in such a way as to get the prize.' 1 Corinthians 9:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>William Arthur Ward wrote: 'Believe while others are doubting. Plan while others are playing... Decide while others are delaying. Prepare while others are daydreaming. Work while others are wishing. Save while others are wasting. Listen while others are talking. Smile while others are frowning... Persist while others are quitting.' If you're always comparing yourself to everybody else, you'll never fulfil your potential. </p>
<p>Paul talked about life being like a race, and how we should 'run in such a way as to get the prize.' Who are we competing against? Ourselves, really. Each person who has put their faith in Jesus can receive the prize. That's good to know because there's always going to be someone faster, stronger and smarter than you. And when you feel like you can't go on, remember that God isn't just at your finishing line, He's running your race with you too. The Holy Spirit is our own personal trainer. </p>
<p>Three important pointers for running the race of life: ()<i> Get going.</i> Starting anything is often the toughest part, but don't be put off. ()<i> Push yourself.</i> Our culture loves leisure time, but too much of it may mean we achieve nothing. ()<i> Don't give up.</i> It matters both how you start and the way you finish, so don't stop short when you're on to something good! If you've got ll the gear but no idea, read 1 Corinthians 9:25!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A gentle answer deflects anger, but harsh words make tempers flare.' Proverbs 15:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan... all these countries seem to have scored poorly in the delicate art of handling conflict. But are we any better? It's worth considering how we handle our own pressure cooker scenarios. Is it a case of pot, kettle, black? </p>
<p>Most of us don't naturally choose to have enemies. The main reason people get deleted from our friend list is because of the way we deal with conflict, or handle differences of opinion. A verbal pounding might seem a fair reaction when a person is doing your head in, but it won't do yourself or the situation any favours. Even if you think you're in the right, hang fire and take some deep breaths. </p>
<p>First, look at the situation through the other person's perspective. Get right into their shoes. And secondly, think through exactly what it is you want to say. Each day can throw things up that could make your blood boil, but Jesus says: 'Let me teach you...I am humble and gentle at heart.' (Matthew 11:29 NLT) </p>
<p>You probably won't nail it in your first peace-keeping mission, but commit to keep learning as the same sort of situations come back around. That's your route to diffusing the bomb rather than setting it off.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil.' 1 John 3:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Over the next few days, we're going to be looking at the basic fact that Satan is defeated. There's no reason to hide behind the sofa at the mention of the 's' word, and we'll find out why.</p>
<p>Satan is real - but he won't be announcing himself in your living room in a red catsuit with a pitchfork. And throw far from your mind the 'good god of light' and 'bad god of darkness' model that paints Satan as an equal and opposite power to God. Satan holds some power. But he is <i>not</i> God. And it's important to understand that God has once and for all annihilated Satan's dominion. He loses. God wins. It's not even close - it's more comparable to an elephant trampling a worm. </p>
<p>Satan's greatest weapon is your ignorance of God's Word. That's why he will fight you over Bible reading more than most other things. Jesus said, 'You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' (John 8:32 NIV) The truth itself doesn't set you free; it's 'knowing' the truth, standing on it in times of trouble and trusting God to do what He has said, that empowers you not only to survive Satan's attacks, but to triumph over him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' John 8:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>First words matter. They often tell us what matters most to someone. For babies it's usually 'Mama' or 'Dada'. God's first words (in the Bible) are significant too and show us what matters to Him: 'Let there be light.' (Genesis 1:3 NLT) To God, light really matters, and if you're His child then it should matter to you too.</p>
<p>But sometimes we prefer the dark. After all, keeping things hidden can be so much easier in the dark. We can say things are fine when they're not. Satan loves the dark because it's harder to spot what he's up to there. His favourite thing is sin brushed under the carpet where it can fester and grow. A pure white sheepskin rug doesn't mean the floor underneath is perfect; there could be a stain you're trying to hide.</p>
<p>Satan is referred to in Scripture as 'darkness' and Jesus as 'light'. (Acts 26:18) Darkness and light don't mix. Jesus' life on earth shone so bright even the most religious people couldn't handle it. He wants you to shine too, but that means letting go of the darkness. He wants to reveal the darkest parts of your life so you can walk freely in the light. The moment the light moves in, the darkness has to move out. So your first priority is not to conquer Satan, but to move closer to Jesus; to line up your will and your word with His will and His Word. When you understand who you are 'in Christ', you are more than a match for the devil and he can no longer control your life. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.' Hebrews 2:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Some people hate heights. Some are scared of snakes. You might fear drowning. But behind all these (what seem like perfectly reasonable) fears is fear of death itself, and most people have it. </p>
<p>But it doesn't have to be that way. One reason why the Gospel really is 'good news' is that when you believe in Jesus, what happens when you die isn't an issue. Satan's all about stealing, killing and destroying. It might have seemed like his mission was accomplished when Jesus died, but not even death could rule Jesus. He rose again three days later! And, 'Does the Spirit of the one who brought Jesus back to life live in you? Then the one who brought Christ back to life will also make your mortal bodies alive by His Spirit who lives in you.' (Romans 8:11 GWT)</p>
<p>Paul went even further, saying that he was not only not afraid of death, but trusted God completely with it! 'Living means opportunities for Christ, and dying - well, that's better yet!' (Philippians 1:21 TLB) Paul hadn't lost the plot, he was sold out for Jesus and had an unparalleled confidence that meant death was just another step closer to Jesus. He was living out a win-win situation! You can be in that win-win situation too! Check out the inside back cover.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their authority. With the cross, He won the victory...' (Colossians 2:15 NCV)<br /><br /><p>If you've ever asked, 'Who am I?' then being a Christian should answer that question for you. You are a son or daughter of the Most High God. And you were made in the image of God. Satan is jealous and would love to rob you of your identity and drag you down to his level. </p>
<p>When you accept Jesus into your life, not only does God rescue you from darkness but He calls you His own. You'll discover who you are and how you're meant to live your life. With Jesus, you can even do greater things than Jesus did! (John 14:12)</p>
<p>See what Jesus told the disciples about their status, when they returned from a mission trip buzzing with excitement: '&quot;Lord, even the demons obey us when we use Your name!&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; He told them, &quot;I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning! Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you. But don't rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in Heaven.&quot;' (Luke 10: 17-20 NLT)</p>
<p>When you know who you are 'in Christ' (check out Ephesians 2:4-7), you don't have to fear Satan - he's been defeated!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The serpent...asked the woman, &quot;Did God really say you must not eat...?&quot;' Genesis 3:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>Satan's no doormat. His first strategy is to make you question and doubt God. Then he'll use your power of reasoning. 'That part's not relevant,' he'll mock. 'That was written to a specific culture, you don't have to listen to it now.' He'll do what he can to get you to hold Scripture at arm's length - he might even cherry-pick bits of the Bible as part of his ploy. If he can, he'll rob you of your confidence in simply trusting God. </p>
<p>When Satan's got under your skin, you can justify all sorts of things that are actually wrong. The lies he'll tell will sound like the truth. The very fact you're entertaining the conversation with him is dangerous. But don't go to war with Satan armed with the last segment of James 4:7, 'Resist the devil', without going through the training ground of the first segment, 'submitting yourself to God'.</p>
<p>You won't hear from a talking snake, but Satan's subtle messages are thrown at us 24/7 in all sorts of ways, including the media and the education system. Sometimes sneaky, sometimes outright, lies and temptations will be pumped at you everywhere. Even the people around you might be saying, 'Whatever makes you happy! So long as you're not hurting anyone.' This is a pretty dangerous lie, so watch out. In everything, remember - if Jesus has already won your heart, the devil can't make you do anything. Take a moment to pray Psalm 51:10-13 as a prayer of commitment and surrender to God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I searched for someone to stand in the gap...' Ezekiel 22:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>JA Wallace said, 'Prayer moves the hand that moves the world.' So let's give prayer its rightful place in our lives - first place! In the book <i>Glorious Intruder</i>, Joni Eareckson Tada writes about a woman called Diane, who suffers from multiple sclerosis: 'In her quiet sanctuary Diane turns her head slightly on the pillow towards the cork board on the wall. Her eyes scan each thumb-tacked card. Each photo. Each torn piece of paper, carefully pinned in a row. The stillness is broken as Diane begins to murmur. She's praying. Some would look at her, stiff and motionless, and shake their heads, &quot;What a shame, her life has no meaning.&quot; But Diane is confident, convinced that her life is significant and that her labour of prayer counts. She moves mountains that block the paths of missionaries. She helps open the eyes of the spiritually blind in South East Asia. She pushes back the kingdom of darkness that blackens the alleys and streets of the gangs in east LA. She aids homeless mothers, abused children, despondent teenagers, and dying forgotten old people in the nursing home down the street from where she lives. Diane is an intercessor! She has heard the call of God, &quot;I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land.&quot; So Diane is on the front lines advancing the Gospel of Christ, holding up weak saints, inspiring doubting believers, and delighting her Lord and Saviour.' Are you 'standing in the gap' for someone? If not, go for it! Your prayers will move God and He will come through for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Rise up...take courage and do it.' Ezra 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Accelerating into the night sky, showering vibrant colours and erupting with sound - fireworks are fantastic, but they fade fast. We can be like fireworks, when God wants us to be more like fires. </p>
<p>If you're more 'firework' than 'fire that works', it's worth asking yourself what's going on. Great ideas and visions can quickly burn in our hearts, but without the courage and commitment to see things through to completion, you won't have the finished article. Just like the metal used to make the wings of an aeroplane, you'll be put through stress testing. When turbulence hits, do you find you're more <i>coke can</i> than <i>jet fighter</i> grade aluminium?</p>
<p>Tests and trials might freak you out, but one of their main aims is to spur you on from where you're at and what you know. Besides, an honest assessment is not a bad thing. God knows you well enough to know that you will fall, but He also wants you to bounce right back up again. 'The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again.' (Proverbs 24:16 NLT) Stay committed, in spite of the difficulties. Ralph Waldo Emerson said: 'Whatever course you decide upon, there will always be someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires courage.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came...in a vision...' Genesis 15:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Abraham is often used as a great example of faith, and rightly so. He was no spring chicken when he heard God speak to him, but he quickly got with God's programme and, a few hiccups aside, followed Him obediently. After all, God said, 'All the families on earth will be blessed through you.' (Genesis 12:3 NLT) That's quite a statement!</p>
<p>Maybe you feel like God's not interested anymore. Maybe you're thinking, 'Did I hear You wrong, God?' Perhaps you've posted an 'out-of-bounds' sign on some dreams you once had, or hopes you had for your future. Before shutting off from God, check how your own attitude lines up. Here are a few thoughts on breathing life back into lost hopes: </p>
<p>(1) Don't be too narrowly idealistic. Going to God with a shopping list of wants isn't what prayer is all about. Assuming things will pan out one way then throwing a hissy fit when they turn out another isn't going to impress anyone. Know that He is always close to you no matter what way things turn out. (2) Keep dreaming. Every day brings new possibilities, so don't close yourself off from new stuff just because it doesn't fit with your plan. (3) Thank God for the little successes, even if they're baby steps. (4) Make personal growth your goal. The only way to fulfil a big vision is to grow with it. The bigger the vision, the bigger you have to be to achieve it. What is God revealing to you in your current situation? How can you grow? The greatest reward of pursuing a vision is - who you become as a result.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Only the things that cannot be shaken will remain.' Hebrews 12:27 NCV<br /><br /><p>Ever had those days when everything goes wrong? When the world seems to gang up on you and you start to wonder if there's a huge target painted on your back? You try dialling up for God but there's no answer. The line seems busy. Soon enough, you're feeling some shots of discouragement - they're like daily arrows of frustration that wear you down and steal your joy.</p>
<p>Satan's like a terrorist specialising in guerrilla warfare. He knows he'd lose big time if he went against the forces of Heaven, so he singles out individual believers. The question is, how do you stand firm when 'everything that...can be shaken' is shaking? Well, for starters, Isaiah says, 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You...' (Isaiah 26:3 NKJV) If Moses had focused on his circumstances, he'd never have had peace standing between the Red Sea and the Egyptians. His peace came from knowing he was right where God wanted him to be. But peace itself isn't the goal; peace is a by-product of knowing: 'How great is Your goodness, which You have stored up for those who [honour] You...' (Psalm 31:19 NIV)</p>
<p>Sometimes God allows shaky times in order that we would draw faith from Him. Ask God to give you strength to endure.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.' Psalm 23:1 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it?' (Luke 15:4 NLT) Can you recall when you were that one lost sheep? Do you remember when Jesus found you? Where would you be without Him?</p>
<p>Eighty percent of Jesus' listeners made their living off the land. Many were shepherds living in the countryside with their sheep. No flock ever grazed without a shepherd and no shepherd was ever off-duty. When the sheep wandered, the shepherd found them. When they fell, he picked them up and carried them. When they were wounded, he fixed them up. Sheep aren't clever; they don't think for themselves and they probably invented the game 'follow the leader'. They need a shepherd to lead them to '...still waters.' (Psalm 23:2 KJV) They have no natural defence - no claws or sharp teeth. They need a shepherd with a big stick to protect them from predators (Psalm 23:4). They have no sense of direction. They need someone who knows the way to lead them '...on paths that are right...' (Psalm 23:3 NCV) So do we. We tend to get swept away in we should have avoided. We have no natural defence against our enemy who goes about as a '...roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NAS) And finally, we lose our way, don't we? No doubt about it, we need a shepherd. Not a cowboy to herd us, a true shepherd to lead us - and aren't you glad we have one looking out for us every minute of every day. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Trust in the Lord...' Proverbs 3:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>'Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.' (Proverbs 3:5-6 NKJ) But what if your path leads through pain, pressure and problems? John the Baptist's did. He didn't deserve imprisonment. After all, he was Jesus' cousin and the voice of God in his community. So he sent Jesus a message asking, 'Are you really the Messiah, or should we keep looking?' Paraphrased: 'If you're Lord, and you're in charge, what is going on with this prison business?!' It's a question asked from unfulfilled expectations. We think, 'Lord, if You're good, how come things aren't working out for me?' And it feels so much worse when you've been trying your best to faithfully serve Him. </p>
<p>If you're in this sort of situation now, it's not because God has not suddenly turned against you. Zapping you with suffering is not His response to your actions. We do not know a definite explanation of 'why' bad things happen, but we do know that even in the midst of them, God is for you, and that means He is for you in a very real way, right now. He asks us to trust Him, and trust that He is doing something with everything that happens. We can hope that He will do something good too, because it is in His very nature to turn awful situations for good. Want a good example? How about the cross... So you can say, in suffering, 'I don't know why this is happening, but I know that God can redeem it, and bring good out of it.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who works out everything in agreement with...His...will.' Ephesians 1:11 AMP<br /><br /><p>A bored Christopher Wren was skimming stones across a river when, to his astonishment, he looked up to see each stone had magically fallen into place to erect a church. Lo, St. Paul's Cathedral was born! Michelangelo was mindlessly vandalising a slab of marble when a passerby pointed out its uncanny resemblance to King David. Amazing! Neil Armstrong had fallen asleep at the wheel. Imagine his surprise when he woke up on the bright side of the moon!</p>
<p>No, none of these historic events happened by chance; they were all the result of the finest planning and careful attention to detail. Should it surprise us then that the architect, artist and pioneer of the universe should has thought very, very carefully about His creation? And you - yes, <i>you</i> - are a part of that.</p>
<p>Psalm 139 argues a pretty good case for God having you in His mind's eye long before your dad met your mum. Maybe you've been made to feel like you were an accident. It's nothing to God. It doesn't even enter His view of you. Regardless of the circumstances of your birth, God is always more than able to achieve His plan for you. He brought you into being because He loves you. God didn't cut and paste you into His creation - you were always in His heart.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...trouble produces patience.' Romans 5:3 NCV<br /><br /><p>Storms come for a reason. They also come for a season. Discover the reason and grow wiser. Outlast the season and grow stronger; but never quit! Chuck Swindoll writes: 'Somebody needs to address the other side of Christian life, if for no other reason than to uphold reality. We need to be told that difficulty and pressure are par-for-the-course. No amount of Biblical input, deeper life conferences or super-victory seminars will exempt you from struggle. God promises no bubble of protection. Ask guys like Job, Joseph, Daniel and Paul, and you'll become acquainted with an ancient word that has almost disappeared in this generation of splashy, always-grinning, a-miracle-a-day spirituality: <i>perseverance</i>! I know of no better partner to dance with when you're doing the three-steps-forward and two-steps-back number. It's in the tough times that true character is forged, the life of Christ is reproduced in us, and our flimsy theology is exchanged for a set of convictions that enable us to handle things rather than trying to escape them. It's when the bottom falls out and life tries to pound you into a corner of doubt and unbelief, that you need what perseverance produces: (a) a willingness to accept whatever comes, knowing that by God's grace you'll win and come out stronger (b) a determination to stand firm while those around you are falling or running away (c) insight to see the character-developing hand of God in it all. Without that, we stumble and fall and God is grieved. With it, we survive and conquer and God is glorified.' So, don't quit - instead ask God for the patience to help you as you wait.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord has made them both.' Proverbs 20:12 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Two sisters: one puts her feet up, laughing loudly, talking the night away with the guest. The other diligently sticks to the kitchen, making sure there's soup in the pan, bread in the oven, drinks in cups. And yet it is Mary, the chatterbox, who is commended by Jesus for doing the right thing, not Martha.</p>
<p>To the untrained eye Martha is closer to God; after all she <i>is</i> being servant-hearted, generous and accommodating. Mary seems to have just dropped herself on the sofa. But Jesus sees through appearances. He knows who is close to Him and who is just going through the motions. 'The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord has made them both.' You can fool others with a Christian mask, and you can even fool yourself with it sometimes, but the eye of the Lord sees things as they really are.</p>
<p>Matt Redman penned the lyrics, 'I've filled my time with preparations / Worn the cloak of endless serving / Though this is a part of loving / Some things can grow cold...'  It's not always the massive fall from grace or ten-storey high sin that wrenches us from Jesus. Sometimes, disguised in our endless serving, we can be light years from His presence. If that's you, resolve to take off your Martha make-up and be more like Mary, spending time at the feet of Jesus. Refresh your heart in Christ.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go and be reconciled...' Matthew 5:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says 'Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander.' (Ephesians 4:31 NLT) But how? Sometimes the only way to get over your hurt feelings is to seek reconciliation - getting back the relationships you might have lost. And if you are willing, God will help you do it.</p>
<p>A college professor, teaching on the weight of unforgiveness, asked each of her students to bring a sack of potatoes to class. For each person they refused to forgive, they had to select a potato and write the date on it beside that person's name. Then for a month, without fail, they had to carry that sack of potatoes with them everywhere they went. After lugging those sacks around for a while each student began to recognise how much weight they were carrying, the amount of energy it took to focus on their bag, and that they had to be careful not to leave it in the wrong place. Eventually, as the potatoes began to rot and stink, they realised that getting rid of them was the only sensible move.</p>
<p>Jesus' thoughts on forgiveness go like this: 'If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not, they are not forgiven.' (John 20:23 NIV)<i> </i>He also taught us to pray: 'Forgive our sins as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us.' (Luke 11:4 CEV) If that prayer makes you uncomfortable, do something about it! Take time alone with God and ask Him for the strength to forgive that someone who has been weighing you down.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Just say a simple...no.' James 5:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Question one: Your pastor asks you to consider joining the frisbee community outreach team. Do you... (a) Go straight to the frisbee shop. Hey, if the pastor has asked you, the Lord has spoken, right? (b) Tell your pastor you'll get back to him after you've weighed up the commitment and prayed about it.</p>
<p>Question two: Your best mate has been out partying all weekend, and now finds herself with no coursework to hand in. She texts you, asking to copy yours. Do you... (a) Email her the essay you've been working on for the last month. The Good Samaritan could learn a thing or two from you. (b) Explain that you won't be pressured into doing something compromising. For some reason, always saying 'yes' can seem like the Christian thing to do. We want to be good witnesses and let our light shine. But Jesus didn't preach, 'blessed are those who blindly say &quot;yes&quot; without thinking it through.' The Bible says, 'Let your no be [a simple] no, so that you may not sin.' (James 5:12 AMP) You're not a shining light if you're burnt out from saying yes to everything. Sometimes 'no' is the right answer. It's not always easy but, if you don't say 'no' to the things outside your gifting and call, you'll end up investing too much time and energy in what seems urgent, and neglect what's important.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He prayed that he might die...' 1 Kings 19:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Elijah had just stood up to the prophets of the god Baal and the goddess Asherah. The people had gathered on Mount Carmel to watch the contest: in one corner, Elijah and, in the other, 850 of Baal and Asherah's prophets. The result was a knockdown victory for Elijah: fire from Heaven had come in answer to his prayer. The false prophets were totally defeated.</p>
<p>Enter, stage right: one very miffed monarch. You know the sort. She's the type they used for a model for all the wicked queens in fairytales. Except that Jezebel was very real. And so nasty that when she tossed a death threat Elijah's way, he folded completely. He was so scared he ran as fast as he could for the desert and begged God to let him die.</p>
<p>His focus had shifted from God to his circumstances. The moment we start to dwell on problems instead of God, we too can become overwhelmed like Elijah. Now, God didn't reach a hand through the clouds and instantly smite Jezebel, and neither did He zap Elijah straight to Heaven. Not yet, anyway. Instead God spoke to him in a 'still small voice.' (1 Kings 19:12 NKJ)</p>
<p>Even those with great faith are not always strong. Every Christian, no matter what emotional state they are in, must continually come back to this place of quiet listening to God. What you really need is to meet with that still small voice. Let God whisper to your soul. Today, find a spot where you can be quiet for a few minutes and just be, with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It's an understandable mistake. Jesus' disciples were expecting the King of the Universe to be like the kings of the earth. So they were looking forward to swanky chariots, palatial mansions looking out over the Sea of Galilee, armies of servants to anticipate His every whim (not to mention those friends sitting on His right and His left hand when His Kingdom arrived.) But what did they get? A king who was a<i> </i>role-model of servanthood. A king who said, 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.' Jesus gave up everything to love and serve everyone. That's why He left the glory of Heaven: to pick up the pieces of the mess we've made.</p>
<p>This is not an easy act to follow, but it is the way of the cross we are called to. So why are so many Christians still hungry to be a success in the world's eyes? Why do we want the modern equivalent of the swanky chariot, palatial home and servants on call 24/7?</p>
<p>Jesus said, 'If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for My sake, you will save it. And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?' (Matthew 16:25-26 NLT) Live a life worth remembering, live in Jesus' way: live for others. To live for Jesus means your life is His property and your hopes and aspirations are laid at His feet, so you can instead take up your cross and follow. (Matthew 16:24)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be holy in all you do.' 1 Peter 1:15 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>The young man was down on one knee, the restaurant was dead silent. All eyes were on the flushed girl who drew a hand to her face. 'Would you make me the happiest guy on the planet by setting apart yourself for me? Would you share the rest of your days with me? Would you marry me?' With one quiet 'yes', the place erupted. But as the happy couple walked arm in arm to the restaurant door, the young man stopped, dropped her hand, and made for the young slightly blonder girl at table two. Straightening his tie, he lowered himself to one knee. 'Darling, would you make me the happiest guy on the planet...'</i></p>
<p>How to turn a picture of romance into one of shallowness! Marriage should be an example of a holy relationship, a husband and wife setting themselves apart, putting other options aside, in order to devote themselves exclusively to each other. Our relationship with God should be a holy one. We should remain faithful, not getting down on one knee to every whim and fancy. We should set ourselves apart for God. Spend valued time together, share our hearts, our deepest desires, talk, laugh, journey together. And when the going gets tough, you don't throw in the towel, you work through it. Devoted, passionate, faithful - that's how you are 'holy in all you do'. Sound like marriage? Many of the things important in a good marriage also apply to your relationship with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Walk in wisdom...redeeming the time.' Colossians 4:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There was a time when the concept of adolescence didn't exist. Back in the good old days, parents would school you and marry you off before the age of sixteen. There was no <i>time</i> to be youthful. And yet here we are in the third millennia, Xbox-ed up to our eyeballs, drip-fed with downloads, leisure-time junkies, complaining that there just aren't enough hours in the day for praying or 'making time for God'. We have more time-saving devices (think of your gran stirring a pot of boiled pants with a broomstick next time you drop your clothes in the washing machine) and yet seem to have less time than any other generation.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time you took control of the clock. We easily make time for other things that we are enthusiastic about - we just need to transfer that skill into the everyday with God. Start simple. Instead of dedicating the entire month of March to games, books or DVD boxsets, think about scheduling the odd hour of quiet time. Switching your console off and opening your Bible might not be as complicated as you think. One method might be to put a reminder on your phone for quiet time. That way you can be intentional about spending some time with God. Don't feel guilty if you miss one or two - remember, 'quiet time' exists in order to enrich <i>the rest</i> of your life, not to segment off God into regular small spots. It is good for you. Rather than file away your spiritual life into these set times alone, think about how you can spend quality time with God in order to increase the overall quality of your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach us to realise the brevity of life...' Psalm 90:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Some people know that life is short, and they make their time count. Gladys Aylward, for example. 'Gladys who?' People thought the same about a hundred years ago. Gladys was an ordinary working girl in London, doing nothing particularly glamorous apart from saving her wages. Eventually she saved enough to boat over to China, where she founded her own inn. She took in orphans and risked her life to intervene in prison riots. In 1938, Japanese forces invaded, and Gladys led 94 orphans across the mountains to safety, despite being wounded herself. In the last twenty years of her life, she founded an orphanage in Taiwan, dedicating her last days on this earth to helping the poor and needy. Her life story was so inspirational that Hollywood made a film about her: <i>The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</i>.</p>
<p>Talk about making your life count! Gladys understood what the psalmist meant when he spoke about life being brief. But it wasn't any big, grand, flashy life she embraced. It was quiet, unnoticed dedication and intentional care for others. We need to realise that making our lives count doesn't necessarily mean making ourselves a big deal. In fact, if we make our lives count Jesus' way, it means the exact opposite.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I must work...while it is day.' John 9:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jesus didn't have a watch to keep His eye on the time, yet by thirty-three He'd achieved everything He'd been put on the earth for. How did He use His time so well?</p>
<p>(1)<i> He understood who He was.</i> His 'working day' consisted of teaching and praying and healing; and even in His spare time He was teaching and investing into His friends. Never was a man so busy and yet, He knew what He wanted to do, and everything else fell into place around that. Jesus was happy with who He was. He went to sleep content. Once you discover how God wants you to live, anything not in line with it will be easy to spot.</p>
<p>(2)<i> He knew His limits.</i> The Son of God surely knows no limits, right? Well, Jesus would spend the first part of His day up a mountain in prayer. The Son of God recognised where His power came from. He recognised the value of silence and quiet time with God. If Jesus needed it, how much more should we be thinking through our day on the back of early morning prayer?</p>
<p>(3) <i>He cared for and invested into others.</i> Jesus wasn't working out a business model. He treated people as people. Jesus said, 'I will build My church...' (Matthew 16:18 NKJ) He had a plan, but it would be worked out by trusting other people.</p>
<p>So, the way to maximise your time - keep your life's purpose before you at all times and evaluate each decision in the light of it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have come that they may have life...to the full.' John 10:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes when we achieve the things we strive for, we find they're not very fulfilling. As we look back we realise that our greatest joy was not in the goal we reached, but in the growth we experienced on the way to it. Scientist Koichi Tanaka had this feeling as he worked on trying to create an ion with lasers: 'I failed for weeks and months before I succeeded in making an ion. Why did I continue the experiment? Because I enjoyed it. It was fun for me to come to know something that I had never known before, and that fun enabled me to persist.' That persistence helped him to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<p>You have the potential to make many wonderful discoveries in life, and none greater than what you discover about God, and yourself.</p>
<p>God tells us, 'I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close.' (Revelation 3:8 NLT) Just as Jesus has once and for all opened the door for your connection with God, He will also open doors specific for you, to lead you into paths that are good for you. When you see one of these doors opening from God, jump through it! There's no guarantee it will be a journey free of struggles but, like the scientist, take it slow, notice what God is doing and there will be joy in the journey. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the words of my mouth...be acceptable in Your sight...' Psalm 19:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>What would happen if someone stood up on Sunday morning and swore at everyone in the congregation? It wouldn't be tolerated. A church would hopefully take something of a hard line on this sort of behaviour. Now, what would happen if you casually slipped this into conversation over coffee: 'We really need to pray for so-and-so, I hear that he's cheating on...'? Would our helpfully hypothetical church take the same line on this sort of behaviour? Maybe not.</p>
<p>Gossip can be a tolerated sin in churches. Sin is sin, though. Jesus doesn't tiptoe around careless words, He says they 'come from an evil heart.' (Matthew 15:18 TLB) And there'll be no gain from brushing them under the carpet either: 'I tell you this, you must give an account on judgment day for every idle word you speak.' (Matthew 12:36 NLT)</p>
<p>Gossip can seem like a good thing. After all, when we are chatting, we are getting closer to the other person, aren't we? We're laughing, we're sharing something, we're taking the same side on something, aren't we? But stop and think about the words that are coming out of your mouth. There'll always be someone wanting to draw you into gossip so watch out and  'Let your speech always be with grace...that you may know how you ought to answer each one.' (Colossians 4:6 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Take over the land...flowing with milk and honey.' Deuteronomy 11:8-9 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the super-size West, we have a crisis if there's a two-week chocolate shortage or no breakfast cereal in the supermarket. But imagine what it's like to live in a place where you are completely dependent on your crops growing - otherwise you don't eat.</p>
<p>As slaves in Egypt, the Israelites faced this reality every day. Not particularly famed for its drizzly days, Egypt got its water from the River Nile and God's people had to rely on it for their crops too. Individuals were forced to pump the water by foot every day. Picture the sheer amount of blood, sweat and tears just on an old foot-pump. Contrast that with the life God promises them: 'Go in and take over the land...flowing with milk and honey...not like the land of Egypt...where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot.' (Deuteronomy 11:8-10 NIV) Oh, the relief to be off the foot-pump and into the flow!</p>
<p>Have you been in a place where everything seems like an effort, and you slave away with sweat, blood and tears just to stand still? Well, God promises a day when you will no longer struggle as His goodness will flow into all areas of your life. But this promise is conditional - it's for those who obey God: 'Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land...' (Deuteronomy 11:8 NIV) Obedience may not be your favourite word but it is the key that opens the door of God's blessing.<i> </i></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.' Jeremiah 31:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>How do you deal with the heartbreak, anger and questions of losing someone? Go to Jesus. He has total, endless compassion. You can find Him at the scene of death and grief in the story of Lazarus (John 11). There, we find out a few things about His reaction to grief... (1) <i>Jesus allows us to question</i>. When Lazarus died, Martha asked, in effect, 'Where were You when we needed You, Lord?!' Jesus wasn't upset with her. That's because God's response in these situations is to 'never cease' in love. And Lamentations 3:22 ESV says it is 'steadfast love'. That means it's fixed and never moves. It's more permanent than the oldest stars in the universe. It will be there long after the last light in space goes out. (2) <i>Jesus shows us how to grieve.</i> 'Jesus wept', not because He was powerless, but because He was human and had human emotions. He was our example. Working through grief isn't a problem to simply get over, it's seriously important for the soul. So feel deeply, relate honestly, stay open to healing. </p>
<p>Some people get through their grief faster than others; sadly, some never do. But you don't have to be one of them! God said, 'I will turn their mourning into joy. I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.' God can reframe your past and give it meaning. He can help you to look back with gratitude, then forward with confidence. How? By transforming painful memories into powerful motivators and sources of future wisdom. Ask Him; He will show you how!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He has...conveyed us into the Kingdom of the Son.' Colossians 1:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>The King James Bible says God has 'delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.' The New King James Bible says, 'He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the Kingdom of the Son.' In one version it says we were 'conveyed,' in the other it says we were 'translated.' Both translations are correct; each just gives us a different angle on the truth. Let's look at each: (1) <i>Conveyed</i>. When someone buys a house, a legal document<i> conveys</i> ownership into the buyer's name. 'You were bought at a price; therefore glorify God...' (1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJV) God owns you, therefore He has the right to send you anywhere and ask anything of you. (2) <i>Translated</i>. We translate books from one language to another. As a result the words sound different. Understand this: you are a child of God so start speaking His language! When God's Word says you 'can' and you say you 'can't,' it's an open invitation for Satan to influence you. Your new birth calls for a new language. The Bible says that the power of life and death are in your tongue. So learn to say what God's Word says about each situation you face. This is not easy, and it's not learned overnight. But if you study your Bible each day, you'll get to the place where your first response will be to quote God's Word. When that happens your life will change for the better.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['O You who hear prayer, to You all flesh will come.' Psalm 65:2 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Homework, Facebook, Twitter, TV, PS3, music, sorting the sock-drawer. Now we've given you enough things to do instead of praying, here's one good reason to start praying: to get to know God better.</p>
<p>A pastor of a mega-church admitted that for many years he preached more than he practiced prayer, until one day God pulled him up on it. 'It has been twenty years since I began taking time to pray. My life has been transformed. The greatest fulfilment hasn't been the list of miraculous answers to prayer I've received, although that has been wonderful; the greatest thrill has been the quality of difference in my relationship with God. When I started to pray I didn't know what was going to happen. God and I used to be rather casually related to one another. We didn't get together and talk very much. Now, however, we get together a lot, not talking on the run, but carrying on substantial, soul-searching conversations every morning for a good chunk of time. I feel as if I've gotten to know God a lot better since I started praying.'</p>
<p>Martin Luther said, 'I have often learned more in one prayer than I have been able to glean from much reading and reflection.' Do you want to know God better? The answer is found in prayer. Try setting your alarm clock an hour earlier for tomorrow morning. Keep your Bible next to your bed, and start the day off by spending that first hour reading and praying.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your Father in Heaven [will] give good gifts to those who ask...' Matthew 7:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Some of us have (or had) fantastic parents, and had the blessing of a tip-top start in life. (Thank God for that, right now.) Others of us, through no fault of our own, faced harsh realities from an early age. You may have been through battles that other people your age have no idea about and you may still be nursing your scars. If that's you, it's ok. God's still got you. (And, if you need help, go talk to someone about it.)</p>
<p>Whatever your human parents were like, God is the perfect parent. He finds nothing sweeter in the universe than the moment when you turn to Him. If you're hungry, He'll feed you. If you need healing, He'll heal you. If you're fearful, He'll strengthen you. He won't interfere where He's not wanted, though. If you need something, He wants you to ask. You've got to open up that line of communication. But when you do, nothing in the world will keep Him from giving you His full attention.</p>
<p>'Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me.' (Psalm 27:10 NIV)</p>
<p>Note down your conversations with God in a prayer diary so you can look back and see how God has answered your prayers.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray continually.' 1 Thessalonians 5:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>An enemy army was zooming up, intent on wiping Israel out. So Moses let Joshua in on his battle strategy: 'You go fight them. I'll go up that hill and pray.' (Read all about it in Exodus 17) Joshua might have wondered how effective that would be but, as it turned out, it was only while Moses had his hands raised to Heaven that Joshua's troops made headway. As soon as Moses dropped his arms, Joshua's troops were struck down. Moses eventually had to have help from Aaron and Hur to stretch up his arms toward Heaven and bring the matter before the Lord. However, when he did, the tide of battle shifted. Without God, the Israelites were losing but with Him, it was a different story.</p>
<p>There's a lesson here: if you reach out for God, His power will reach back to you to help you with your daily battles. The flip-side is, it's hard for Him to release His power in your life when you just put your hands in your pockets and say, 'I can handle this on my own.' Instead you may find yourself a casualty on one of life's battlefields. 'At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in Heaven and on earth and under the earth.' (Philippians 2:10 NLT) So, pray - until your arms feel like dropping off! If Moses could ask for help, so can you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him.' Psalm 91:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Ok, the film <i>Bruce Almighty</i> is mainly an excuse for a series of plastic-faced explosions from Jim Carrey, but there's some pretty good sermon fodder in there too. Like the bit about prayer. Bruce keeps hearing voices building up and up. He discovers they are people's prayers waiting for an answer. He tries to answer them individually through email but finds he just can't keep up with the demand. Finally he sets his email to automatically respond to 'yes' for every request. Good idea, he thinks - <i>everybody gets what they want</i>. The film goes on to illustrate the pandemonium this carefree, couldn't-care-less approach to prayer has.</p>
<p>It makes an important point. Prayer is not about having God as your own personal genie in a bottle. Prayer is about living in relationship with God. Prayer is a gift, not a duty. You may think having a boyfriend or girlfriend who always did exactly what you want would be a dream come true, yes? No: the true joy of the relationship would be lost, because you'd have a slave, not a partner.</p>
<p>Prayer is about getting close to God. Yes, sometimes He will give you what you want, but sometimes He won't. Sometimes it will seem like He's not even answering. God is your Father, not your genie, and the time you spend with Him is the point.  'The Lord is close to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth.' (Psalm 145:18 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For we do not know what we should pray for...' Romans 8:26 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Prayer is about working on a relationship with God. And because the God we have is no ordinary friend, there are immense benefits to spending time with Him. If you had Superman as a best friend and your flight to LA was in a nosedive, you'd only need to give him a call and you'd be touching down safely before you could say, 'Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it...'</p>
<p>God always hears our desperate pleas. Sometimes we are so frantic that all we can do is cry out a 000 prayer. He listens to those, too. Those prayers give us instant connection to the One above all emergency situations. 'Also, the Spirit helps us with our weakness. We do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit Himself speaks to God for us, even begs God for us with deep feelings that words cannot explain.' (Romans 8:26 NCV)</p>
<p>The songwriter of Psalm 116 had experience of these sorts of 000 prayers too. He wrote about them there, 'I love the Lord because He hears my voice and my prayer for mercy. Because He bends down to listen, I will pray as long as I have breath!' (Psalm 116: 1-2 NLT) God is above all your panic, and He's on the case before we even know how to pray.<i> </i> 'He hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases Him. And...He will give us what we ask for.' (1 John 5:14-15 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will ask what you desire, and it shall be done.' John 15:7 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In May 1996, ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing 110 passengers. Navy experts tried using special technology to detect the plane's black box, without success. Holding a rope that kept them spaced a metre apart, searchers poked through every square metre of muck. The physical conditions were unbearable. The sun beating down, temperatures in the high 30s, diesel fuel and caustic hydraulic fluid floated in the water, forcing searchers to wear several layers of protective rubber. After fourteen days they'd found nothing. Sergeant Felix Jimenez of Metro-Dade Police was one of the searchers. For fourteen days he'd prayed for the bereaved families and the safety of his fellow workers. But on the fifteenth day as he took a break, suddenly he realised he'd failed to pray for one important thing: that God would help them find the black box. So he asked God for direction, resumed the search, and when he stuck his pole into the water he hit something metallic. He pulled the object out of the muck. It was the black box. Jimenez wrote in <i>Guideposts</i>: 'I thought of the many days we had spent searching for the recorder, how we must have tramped over it many times, and I wondered why its retrieval had taken so long. Amid the low rustle of sawgrass and the call of the wild heron, I seemed to hear the response: &quot;Why did it take you so long to ask?&quot;'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a time for everything...a time to weep and a time to laugh.' Ecclesiastes 3:1-4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nelson Mandela was president of South Africa from 1994-99. Years before, he had been an activist against apartheid (a racist government policy that favoured the rights of white people). For this he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years he was finally released and played a significant part in changing South Africa's inequality and poverty.</p>
<p>Recalling his highs and lows he once said this, 'I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one finds many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.'</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela realised that to change the world for the better you have to accept the rough with the smooth. You have to be prepared to weep and to laugh. You have to accept that there will always be another hill to conquer. For, 'There is a time to be silent and a time to speak. There is a time to love and a time to hate. There is a time for war and a time for peace.' (Ecclesiastes 3: 7-8 NCV) </p>
<p>Always do the right thing - despite how you feel, despite what others may say or do in response. And that, at the end of the day, will lead to fulfilment.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It is finished.' John 19:30 NCV<br /><br /><p>'While Jesus lived on earth...He prayed with loud cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death, and His prayer was heard because He trusted God.' (Hebrews 5:7 NCV)</p>
<p>It happened every year. The Priest would wrestle a young lamb to the altar. He would raise a hatchet high above his head and bury it deep in the animal's neck. Blood would spray across the stone and the people were forgiven for another year. Only this year, a lamb was replaced with a man. And there was no wrestling to the steps of the altar. The angels in Heaven hushed as a soldier raised a hatchet high above his head and buried a nail deep into the hands of the man. And the sky turned black as blood sprayed across rough wood. And on the cross, the Lamb of God was slain. Now there would be no more lambs. And no more blood. And no more sacrifice. And no more would sin be remembered. It happened once and for all. 'For the grace of God (His unmerited favour and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind.' (Titus 2:11 AMP)</p>
<p>His sacrifice on the cross was for <i>you </i>that first Good Friday, two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of history's darkest moment, the disciples would have been stunned. Everything they had given themselves to, their hopes and their plans for reform, had been crucified alongside their agony-stricken, horrifically-wounded Master. He had cried, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?' - the cry of someone overwhelmed by sin, who certainly felt the weight of the sin that separates mankind from God. And now the disciples themselves were lost, leaderless and fearing for their lives. Had they been forsaken, as it looked like Jesus had?</p>
<p>Where was God in all of this? What possible hope was there now?</p>
<p>This was surely their darkest hour. But we know what they didn't.

<introtext><![CDATA['We believe that Jesus died and rose again...' 1 Thessalonians 4:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>John Pritchard tells of a story about an archbishop in Uganda who was killed under the Idi Amin regime. Thousands of Christians gathered on a hill to mourn his passing. But the government refused to give the body back. The people stood around lost. Then the previous archbishop began to read the story of the resurrection. As he read, 'Why do you look for the living among the dead?' a spontaneous shout of praise rose from the crowd. Everyone realised that their leader wasn't a cold corpse in a government morgue but a child of God, safe in the presence of Jesus.</p>
<p>It's the same for us. When Jesus rose again it was not just amazing, not just awesome, but  a bold triumph, a victory! When Jesus rose again, it signalled victory over every trouble life can throw at us, every low moment, every self-esteem issue, even over death itself! </p>
<p>CHRIST IS RISEN! The hymn <i>Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son!</i> is best sung with the broadest beaming grin on your face - God's got you, even through to the other side of death itself. (And all because He loves you!)</p>
<p>Crudely put, 'resurrection' means 'the standing up of a corpse'. Jesus proved there is no corpse when He's around. What does resurrection look like? 'He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, sadness, crying or pain, because all the old ways are gone.' (Revelation 21:4 NCV)</p>
<p>Celebrate! Jesus conquered the grave! Your future, even your death, is secure in His resurrection.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bless those who persecute you...' Romans 12:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>When Jesus preached His 'Sermon on the Mount', He didn't say, 'Love your enemies,' then add a stage whisper to the front row, '...but not you guys. You get a free pass on this one.' No, Jesus' revolutionary new idea was intended for every Christian, to be directed at every kind of person. We might not have enemies in the way the people had back then (think: Roman legions), but we're not off the hook just because our enemies aren't carrying swords or breathing out death threats. We probably have enemies in a different sense (think: people who annoy us, get us down, or oppose our beliefs.)</p>
<p>We're on this planet in order to be a self-sacrificing blessing, even to those sorts of people. You could say that God followers are intentionally 'anti-me'. People are supposed to recognise us because of the way we extravagantly bless others, even those who persecute us. Ok, but doesn't blessing our enemy make us a bit of a walk-over? Well, which is more likely to lead them to Christ, blessing and praying for them, or fighting and keeping our distance from them? It's a severe test of your faith, but in order to follow Jesus, we need to bless others, including those who disagree with you, or rubbish your beliefs, or just plain irritate you. Actually, this isn't a message about other people, it's about sorting your own perspective out. Ann Voskamp said, 'If we only got into the Christ-faith through the door of forgiveness, how can we claim Christ as our home if we aren't people who forgive?' Do we believe in the forgiveness of other peoples' sins, or just our own?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation...' 2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>The thief on the cross became a Christian with his dying breath. So why not spend a few more years experiencing sin while you can, and scrape into Heaven at the last second? That logic is seriously flawed. For one, there are consequences of sin. Was King David forgiven for his sin with Bathsheba? (2 Samuel 11-12) Yes (read Psalm 51) but the consequence of that sin was that their baby died.</p>
<p>Suppose the apostle Paul had  dedicated his life to fast living and prayed a last minute sinner's prayer. He'd still be in Heaven, but the church would be a lot smaller, the Bible a lot thinner. Suppose Mother Teresa spent her time in the casino. Yes, a last dash for salvation would guarantee her place in the book of life, but think of all the thousands of orphans and dying people forever neglected.</p>
<p>The sooner we get on track with God, the more time we'll have for building up an everlasting legacy, and (this is big) finding ourselves ever closer and closer to the living God, <i>here</i>. Because the joy of knowing God - the joy of eternity - doesn't start after you die. More than just the good we can do, walking with God in <i>this </i>life is RIGHT! John 10:10 AMP says: 'I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).' If you've never made your peace with God, know that it is so, so worth it. You can do it now - there's a section inside the back cover to help you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The...Lord has given me...words of wisdom, so that I may know how to comfort the weary...' Isaiah 50:4 NLT <br /><br /><p>James, who wasn't known for mincing his<i> </i>words, tells it like it is: 'A tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. And the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself.' (James 3: 5-6 NLT)</p>
<p>His harsh words might make you want to chop off your tongue, but it is important to carefully consider what we let out of our mouths. So many people don't, and it's no wonder that James describes the sort of careless, insulting language that results as 'set on fire by hell itself!' Let's also focus on the fact that our words can do amazing good as well. Taking a hold of your tongue is more important than all the church meetings you go to (or how many hours you clock in reading the word4U2Day J) Pause each day to pray for guidance, asking God tell you what to say. And He will: TheLord has given mewords of wisdom, so that I know how to comfort the weary. Morning by morning Heopens my understanding to His will. TheLord has spoken to me, and I have listened (Isaiah 50:45 NLT)</p>
<p>Listen, and then speak - as the old saying goes, you've been given two ears and one mouth, which might indicate the proportion of listening to speaking you should do! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever lives in Me...shall produce a large crop of fruit...' John 15:5 TLB<br /><br /><p>It's no mean feat to get a song in the Top 40. But it's when artists get there on a regular basis that they go from 'one-play' to Coldplay. Lasting success over a period of time requires more than one moment of inspiration.</p>
<p>God wants us to be in the habit of being successful too - on His terms. That means caring for the needy, keeping yourself from being polluted by sin, and making time to seek Him regularly. And while He knows that we won't be on top form all the time, He does want us to try to live the best we can, every day. We can't do that in our own strength. That's why today's verse says 'Whoever lives in Me...shall produce a large crop of fruit.' He wants you to live in a way that's obviously Christ-like. Whatever you work at in that way, God does want you to do it well. But more than that, He wants you to do it with Him.</p>
<p>Now, He created the universe without you, so He doesn't need your help in solving the world's problems. But He invites you to the table to let you play a part, through Christ. Carve out prayer time every day and be faithful to it. Try to be kind to those who you would otherwise look past. Be honest with the Holy Spirit, and ask Him to protect your heart from wrong desires. Then you will be well on your way to lasting success! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you...' 2 Corinthians 12:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>The disciples had missed it again. They'd clocked up a few kilometres with Jesus, they had front row seats of Jesus' ministry and they'd seen some amazing miracles. They were feeling pretty good about themselves, and why shouldn't they? They'd made some big sacrifices for Jesus. And, when Jesus was tired after preaching to the masses, it was James and John that He'd chill out with and unwind. So one evening, they boldly went where no disciple had been before: 'Master... we want to sit on the thrones next to Yours in Your Kingdom...' (Mark 10:35-37 TLB) Jesus carefully put them in their place, explaining how God's Kingdom is a topsy-turvy place, 'Among you it is different. Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant. And whoever wants to be greatest of all must be the slave of all. For even I, the Messiah, am not here to be served but to help others and give My life as a ransom for many.' (Mark 10:43-45 TLB)</p>
<p>It's easy to think we'd never be as proud as the disciples were here, but we can quickly lose perspective too. Understanding God's Kingdom isn't rocket science, but it does mean you need to be willing to have heart surgery. Even if 'getting and gaining' might make you successful, it's only by serving Christ that you truly become significant.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will be faithful to you and make you Mine...' Hosea 2:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is God's love letter to you. It's not here one week, gone the next. People who say the three magic words 'I love you,' then fail to live up to it can make us think that God's wired the same way. Because we live among people who disappoint us and let us down, it's easy for us to assume that God works like that. But God is utterly committed to you: '...I have loved you, My people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to Myself. I will rebuild you... You will again be happy...' (Jeremiah 31:3-4 NLT)</p>
<p>Letting God's love filter down from our heads to our hearts means we don't need to look for love in all the wrong places. Nothing about us surprises God or makes Him change His mind, 'Even when we are too weak to have any faith left, He remains faithful to us... for He cannot disown us.' (2 Timothy 2:13 TLB) If we are faithless, He remains faithful.</p>
<p>He says, 'I have called you by name; you are Mine... You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you.' (Isaiah 43:1-4 NLT) You might take your eye off God but He never, ever takes His eye off you. 'There is no one like the God of Israel. He rides across the Heavens to help you...The eternal God is your refuge, and His everlasting arms are under you. He drives out the enemy before you...' (Deuteronomy 33:26-27 NLT) So live in God's love. It's the most secure place on earth!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...At that time men began to call on the name of the Lord.' Genesis 4:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>Prayer meetings can be intimidating. Other people sound so confident and eloquent that you may feel your prayers are not up to the mark. </p>
<p>But the disciples didn't have the first clue about prayer either. There are loads of different ways to pray and God won't give you a hard time for your diction, but finding a framework for prayer could help you start.</p>
<p>First, spend some time just being with your Father, knowing who He is and what He's done. That's the first of three A's: <b>Adore</b>. It's a good place to start because it takes your eyes off yourself. Otherwise, prayer can just be a jumbled mess of personal cares and worries, without ever really looking properly to God. Secondly: <b>Ask</b>. Jesus encouraged His disciples to knock on Heaven's door. There's a place for asking for what we need, and even Jesus needed to get away from the noise and bustle of everyday life to do just that. That leads to the third A: <b>Accept</b>. Jesus prayed for God's will to be done and rounded everything off by looking to His Father again. God loves you perfectly and knows exactly what you can and can't handle at any given time, so you can end your prayers trusting that everything is in its right place. The <i>Lord's Prayer</i> in Matthew 6:9-13 contains this structure, and it all reflects the constant goodness and providing care of God. It is the template Christ gave His disciples when they asked Him, 'Lord, teach us to pray.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Your ears shall hear a word...' Isaiah 30:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>A 'word' from God can bring you the answer you need. God created the world with a word, so imagine what a word from Him could do for your situation. The Bible says, 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &quot;This is the way, walk in it, whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.&quot;' Notice the words, 'Your ears shall hear a word.' But if your spiritual ears are not open, trained and tuned to hear God, you'll miss what He is saying to you. And, if you try and filter what He's saying to you through your intellect so it lines up with your own opinions, you will get nowhere. God gives a 'word' to those who have an open ear - and heart.</p>
<p>When you pray, what are you looking for? A spiritual high, or a time of intimacy with the Lord in which He speaks and you listen? When you read your Bible are you seeking confirmation of your own thoughts, or are you seeking God's will? Imagine what one of God's ideas could do for your life! '...the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits.' (Daniel 11:32 NKJV) If you dream of doing great things in life, get to know God. He will reveal Himself to you through His Word. You'll hear a lot of different ideas each day; some will benefit you, others won't. But when you get a 'word' from God it's like a seed; it has the potential to produce a tree; or better yet, a whole orchard of fruit. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If we love each other, God lives in us...' 1 John 4:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Relationships bring us joy, but they also require effort. Done properly, our ability to communicate is one of the ways God made us to reflect Him.</p>
<p>Even if you believe God's called you to be a recluse in the farthest corner of the world, getting there will require interacting with at least one other human being. And for the rest of us, being part of some sort of team is at the heart of most things we do, so good communication is an absolute must.</p>
<p>Some people are natural talkers, others make good listeners. But whatever category you'd put yourself in; make the effort to improve on what doesn't come naturally to you. Communication breakdown often leads to relationship breakdown. A simple 'How are you?' followed by a period of genuine listening to the response is more than just proving to someone that you care; it could really contribute to a healthy friendship, in turn giving you both a better quality of life. Are you too wrapped up in your own world to give someone else the time of day? We were made for relationships, and good relationships require good communication and good communication requires good listening. So, how's your communication?.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work...' Nehemiah 3:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>When talking about church, one leader once said, 'It's neat and tidy in the graveyard, but it's messy in the nursery.' Despite the chaos, there's no doubt that there's plenty of life in a nursery. So for your church to move ahead it's going to need people who are willing to put some work in.</p>
<p>While rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah wrote, 'The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work.' These guys suffered from two common diseases known as 'convenient commitment' and 'limited involvement'. Which group are you in - the workers or the Nobles? God has a plan for you in your church, and you can do much more than just play your part, you can enjoy the community with the people of God who are there with you.</p>
<p>No matter what church you go to, you'll always find a pick-and-mix bunch - some might be easy to love, and others may 'grow your grace'. But whatever they're like, make sure <b>you</b> are someone who can be relied on. Tomorrow' s good leaders are today's great servants. Getting excited for the summer ball and then not being seen for the next month, isn't the way.</p>
<p>Loads of things demand your attention, but it's only when you prioritise and knuckle down to working with other Christians that your prayers for your church start to get answered. You are the church.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Then you will receive praise, honour, and renown...' Deuteronomy 26:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you had a friend over, you might let them crash on your bedroom floor with a casual 'excuse the mess'. But if the Queen made an unexpected visit, you wouldn't leave dirty dishes piled up in the sink and clothes strewn across the floor. No, you'd give the place a radical makeover! And you wouldn't make her sleep on the floor; nope, it would be the master bedroom. Your goal would be to honour her in every way because her presence had honoured you. Ok, now read this: 'You have declared today that the Lord is your God. And you have promised to walk in His ways, and...do everything He tells you. The Lord has declared today that you are His people, His own special treasure, just as He promised, and that you must obey all His commands. And if you do, He will set you high above all the other nations He has made. Then you will receive praise, honour, and renown...' (Deuteronomy 26:17-19 NLT) When Old Testament priests entered the ministry they went through a rite called 'consecration'. From that moment on they belonged exclusively to God and were committed to obey Him in all things. Ok, so what does any of this have to do with me? Heaps: if you want God to use you, to honour and promote you, you can't marginalise or compartmentalise Him. You must commit yourself to doing His will! And that includes your time, your talent, your treasure, your body, your mind, your spirit, and your <b><i>all</b></i>. God wants 'total commitment'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.' 1 John 5:14 NKJ<br /><br /><p>A preacher once said, 'God speaks through the Bible!' This led to much discussion among the church: 'But God speaks through dreams and visions as well,' said one. 'And He speaks through people too - what about words of knowledge, prophecy and tongues?' pipes up another. 'Hey, didn't he once speak through a donkey?' chips in a third (talking about the story of Balaam in Numbers 22). 'Yes,' agreed the preacher, 'God speaks in all kinds of ways, but there's only one way we can guarantee what we hear from other sources is truly from God - and that's by checking it out in God's Word. God will not say anything different than what He's already told us in the Bible.'</p>
<p>The preacher was right! God speaks truth at all times, and in many different ways, but it will always check out with the principles in Scripture. So if you're struggling to know how best to live your Christian life, don't only copy others or just take advice from sermons; dive into the Bible and hear what God says direct from Heaven (but, here's a challenge, taking verses out of context is an express route to mishearing God! Don't just read the promises of God, study the conditions that go with them and check out the whole passage before you focus on one verse.) God communicates to us in many ways and we can know for sure it's His voice we're listening to if it's there in His Word. God knows what's best for us - it's so important that we listen to Him well. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are...created...to do good works...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>You are unique, wonderful, amazing and magnificent. In fact you are 'God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for [you] to do.'</p>
<p><b><i>Yes, you. Yes. You.</b></i></p>
<p>Right now, God's in the business of training you up, giving you all the right equipment, knowledge, experience, understanding and people you need in your life in order for you to achieve all these good things. He's working on your attitude, your character and thought processes.</p>
<p>We are saved and God 'saved us...not because of anything we did...but because of God's purpose...before time began.' (2 Timothy 1:9 NCV) We are wanted; God '...has given each of [us] a gift from His great variety...to serve one another.' (1 Peter 4:10 NLT) We have supernatural ability to help build the church, 'A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help...' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT) We are on a mission; Jesus said, 'Go and make followers of all people in the world...' (Matthew 28:19 NCV) Don't ever think your life doesn't account for much. You're not just another face in the crowd. Your life has value and purpose, even on the days you're feeling useless!</p>
<p>So, 'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart...since...you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward...' (Colossians 3:23-24 NIV) Can you think of any greater incentive than that moment when you stand in His presence and hear, 'Well done,' for giving it your best shot?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God...will fulfil His purpose for me.' Psalm 57:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>'I can't do anything, I'm totally useless! And they<i> said I was pathetic. Just look at me. I'm hopeless, my life's a mess, everyone would be better off without me.'</i></p>
<p>Have you ever thought or spoken words like this, believing inside that they're true? If so, stop. There is good, wholesome, life-lifting truth that can take the place of these sorts of lies.</p>
<p>Your self-worth is not based upon what you think or what others think about you. The one true authority on your self-worth is Jesus Christ, and since He gave His own life up in order to forgive you (read these words of truth in Luke 5:20), that should tell you just how valuable you really are. And there's more. He doesn't allow the value He's placed in you go to waste; Romans 12:6 NLT tells us; 'In His grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well.' Above all else, He has made you for friendship with Him, and to bring Him glory through that friendship. The Psalmist said, 'I cry out to God...who will fulfil His purpose for me.' So, pray and ask for God's direction. Begin to list your strengths and weaknesses. Get feedback from people who will be honest with you. Once you find your God-given purpose, build your life around it, and '...do it all for the glory of God.' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Always seek to do good to one another and to everyone...' 1 Thessalonians 5:15 ESV<br /><br /><p>A line often quoted from <em>Forrest Gump</em> is... 'My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' People are mixed bags too; they often seem to be more like chocolate seconds than a premium box of Ferrero Rocher. We may all have value in God's eyes (praise the Lord for that!), but we can also be very unpleasant to each other. So when God instructs us to look for the best in each other and 'always seek to do good to one another,' how can you do that, when you feel a person is deliberately winding you up, bullying you or setting out to make your life a living hell? You have to choose to, that's how. It is your decision. The only way to find the best in someone is to choose to look for it. God never asks us to do things that are pointless or bad for us, so when He says to do your best to bring out another person's good qualities, then choose to do it. But it's hard to <em>look for the best in each other, and always do your best to bring it out</em> when you're looking for perfection and focusing on the other person's shortcomings. The Bible also says, 'Love...keeps no record of wrongs.' (1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NIV) So start looking a people through God's eyes and look for the best in them!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 1:1-3:10, Mark 3:7-12, Ps 43, Pr 10:17-18<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['If [your city] prospers, you too will prosper.' Jeremiah 29:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>God cares about your home - not just the building where your family is, but the wider community you're in, right now. Maybe you don't enjoy the place you're living in, but that doesn't mean God has written off your chances of putting down roots and making the most of it.</p>
<p>You might have heard people say things like 'God wants me to move here!' or, 'God wants me to move there!', whether it's to a sunny coastal town, or a city full of opportunities. That's great. Really. God does work like that. But His main concern is that you live <i>fully, </i>in whatever place you are, right at this moment<i>.</i> That won't change your living situation, but it will change how your living situation affects you.</p>
<p>Around 590 BC, many people were taken from Jerusalem to be slaves in Babylon. It was a horrendous situation. Hundreds of kilometres away from home comforts, God spoke to them through Jeremiah, telling them to, 'change your attitude, dig in and make the best of it...pray for peace and prosperity where you live, because when it prospers, you will prosper.' (Paraphrasing Jeremiah 29: 5-7)</p>
<p>God cares about our homes; and when we do our bit to build His Kingdom there, He says things will change for the better. What a promise! The instruction we're given in the Bible is also a beautiful picture: 'Do everything without grumbling or arguing...shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the Word of life.' (Philippians 2:14-16 NIV) If you want to go from surviving to thriving, make the most of where God placed you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I take joy in doing Your will...' Psalm 40:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Why is it that we ask, 'How far can I go in this situation/with this person?' instead of 'How close can I be to God's will?'</p>
<p>For instance, in relationships with the opposite gender, we tend to ask, 'How far can I go before it matters?' when 1 Corinthians 6:18 NLT says, 'Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.' Your sexuality is precious. It's yours - a secret part of you. Messing around with it demeans it. That's why Paul posts a big warning sign, not a list of small print.</p>
<p>And anger. Psalm 4:4 NLT says; 'Don't sin by letting anger control you. Think about it overnight and remain silent.' But how many times have we gone to bed with regret? We don't stop and ask God how we can control our anger, but instead we wade into arguments with both feet. We can also find ourselves giving into temptations too easily, thinking, 'I can't help it.' But 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT says, 'God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.'</p>
<p>God wants you closer than close to His Will, because it's there that you will have greater friendship with Him. Can you, like David, say 'I take joy in doing Your will, my God, for Your instructions are written on my heart'? As believers, God's Word should be so ingrained in our hearts that we want to do what's right, and 'take joy' in doing His will.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Weep with those who weep.' Romans 12:15 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In 1883, poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox was travelling by train to a ball when she noticed a woman weeping. Wilcox crossed the aisle and spent the journey comforting her. When she reached her destination she was in no mood to celebrate. Later, remembering the woman on the train, she wrote a famous poem <em>Solitude</em> which starts: 'Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.' Holly Vicente Robaina says: 'We laugh...play...and celebrate together. Why's it so difficult to cry together? When friends hurt, Christians say, &quot;I'll pray for you&quot;...In some cases God heals and restores, but sometimes there's no miracle - it can be that there's only profound sadness. CS Lewis wrote about losing his wife: &quot;Where's God?... Go to Him when your need is desperate and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double-bolting on the inside.&quot; I don't think Lewis would have been comforted by &quot;God loves you...I'll pray for you.&quot; While it's great to encourage, we need to evaluate our words before we speak. Are we using &quot;encouragement&quot; to ignore somebody's pain?... When we promise to pray for somebody, do we even check on them later?' These are tough questions, but at some stage in your life you will probably be around someone in need of help through grief. Ever wonder why Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb? He could just have told the mourners, 'Everything's ok, folks. God loves you,' and raised Lazarus. Instead He met them where they were, by crying with them.<em> </em>He's our model, when you know someone is in need, visit them, sit with them, listen to them and maybe even cry with them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 8-9, Mark 3:28-35, Ps 130, Pr 10:24-26<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<p>But have you noticed that it's the one thing every human has in common? No matter who you are, or where you're from, everyone goes through it.

In his first letter, the apostle Peter encourages Christians who are being horrifically tortured for their faith. Sadly, pain and suffering have not been far from faithful Christians since the start. But no matter what sort of tough situations we're in, God wants us to help each other through them with real care. Paul frequently includes something like this in his letters: 'How often I pray for you. Day and night, I bring you and your needs in prayer to God...'</p>
<p>Barnabas, another Christian from the Book of Acts, was actually called Joseph. 'Barnabas' was just his nickname. It means 'son of encouragement', so he was probably a fairly good friend to get a nickname like that! When we're going through a hard time we look for those who know what to say, who encourage us. So return the favour and ask God to make you that kind of friend - one who brings comfort and encouragement to others. Do you find it easy to pray for others? Ask God to make you the kind of friend whose presence brings comfort and encouragement.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Share each other's burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ.' Galatians 6:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Are you too caught up in your own problems to help anyone else? We all feel like this sometimes, but it's not a feeling that we're supposed to carry over into a lifestyle.</p>
<p>If you want to live a way that puts others first, you must ask yourself: (1) What am I doing to invest in myself? You can't give what you don't have. Unless you're committed to personal growth you'll have nothing of worth to give others. So, work to 'add to your faith...knowledge' (2 Peter 1:5 NIV) and keep adding! (2) What am I doing to invest in others? Success can cause you to be self-seeking. Although it's good to make the most of your natural talent and work hard, there's always a temptation to ask, 'What can I get from others?' Instead, Christians should be asking, 'What can I give to others?' In the book <em>Come Be My Light</em>, Mother Teresa shares her thoughts about her life and her calling to serve people. 'I don't know what the success will be...but if [we] have brought joy to one unhappy home...made one innocent child from the streets keep pure for Jesus...one dying person die in peace with God...don't you think it would be worthwhile offering everything... for just that one...because that would bring great joy to the heart of Jesus.' Mother Teresa inspired and modelled what servanthood is to the world. But her dream of helping others started small. The way in which you can bless the world around you is to do it - one life at a time.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:22, 2 Pet 3:3-15, Matt 5:39, 1 Sam 25:1-42<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['So we fasted and earnestly prayed...and he heard our prayer.' Ezra 8:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you ever fasted? Many Christians don't understand it, and are left wondering if it is essential to Christian living. But one thing that's very clear from the Bible is that when God asks us to do something, there's always a good reason behind it.</p>
<p>Fasting is not a healthy eating plan or fad diet that's been dragged up from history - it is, admittedly, something of a mystery. We know that it is a spiritual discipline meant to benefit us. As we fast, we recognise our weakness without God's provision, and our total need for God. And then, as we grow closer to Him, it can be a direct way of getting God's attention. (However this doesn't mean you should put yourself in danger. Never fast, if you have a medical condition. And if you have trouble with eating disorders, fasting should always be avoided. We really encourage you to talk to someone older that you trust about a different spiritual discipline other than fasting.)</p>
<p>When Ezra found life overwhelming, he knew God's help was essential, or he'd collapse under the weight of his problems. So he and his friends 'fasted and prayed' (Ezra 8:23). God honoured their commitment.</p>
<p>When we fast, we let God know we are serious about wanting His help. We believe with all of our being that God has the power to change things for the better.</p>
<p>If it is safe for you, consider putting it into practice: fast by skipping a meal or an activity, and use that time to pray for a specific area, person or situation that you're keen to see change.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 12-13, Mark 4:10-20, Ps 103:13-22, Pr 10:30-32<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ sacrificed His life's blood...our sins are now forgiven.' Ephesians 1:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>Is the tight knot of regret a familiar feeling for you? Have the words 'if only' ever echoed around your head? <em>'If only I'd not done that, not said that, not agreed to that!' </em>If you're going through life beating yourself up, or finding it tricky to forgive yourself, listen to this:</p>
<p>'Christ sacrificed His life's blood to set us free, which means that our sins are now forgiven. Christ did this because God was so kind to us.' (Ephesians 1:7 CEV) Let God be God in your life; accept His forgiveness today!</p>
<p>A word of warning: failure to do so could well be seriously detrimental to your health. Your mind and feelings affect your body. Doctors say an attitude of bitterness generates chemicals that affect your vital organs: increase your heart rate, raise your blood pressure, disrupt your digestion, tense your muscles, drop cholesterol into your bloodstream, and reduce your ability to think clearly. All this comes from a life spent rehearsing the past. Science confirms that those who don't forgive themselves and others are more prone to heart attacks, depression, hypertension and other serious illnesses. It points towards a deep truth you'll find in the Bible - bitterness traps people in death, forgiveness leads to life. Start looking ahead. With God's forgiveness comes the wisdom and understanding to not only survive your past, but grow stronger as a result of it. Instead of guilt, choose gratitude. That's not hard to do; just begin to reflect on God's goodness. When you start to look for God's gifts, you'll find lots of things to thank Him for.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 14-15, Mark 4:21-29, Ps 16, Pr 11:1-2<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Praise the Lord...He forgives all my sins...' Psalm 103:2-3 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you've had one, you'll know that computer viruses spell doom. Malicious software spreads throughout your entire system, infects your files and, if not caught in time, can take down your whole system. Ignoring a virus is not an option, as once you have one it continues to damage and destroy, even transferring itself to any other computers it can connect to.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:13 NLT says: 'Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.' Unforgiveness comes naturally to humans. But forgiveness is a gift from God to Christians, to use as often as needed. Without it we're allowing the fast-acting and fast-spreading effects of unforgiveness to run riot.</p>
<p>It's not always easy. We don't always feel like forgiving, it doesn't always appear right, and often we just don't feel like it. Since forgiveness goes against our nature, we must choose to do it by faith. Forgiveness is a gift from God that allows us to relate to each other with real, graceful joy - ask God to help you install it deep in your soul. Search your heart for unforgiveness - of God, of others, of yourself. And ask the Holy Spirit to help you purge it from areas you can't find. Remember: if we live our lives in personal gratitude to God, we will become accepting of His gift of forgiveness, and keener to spread it to others!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 16-17, Mark 4:30-34, Ps 7:1-9, Pr 11:3-6<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good.' Romans 12:21 CEV<br /><br /><p>People are at their worst when they treat each other as less than human. We've all noticed it in society. Ignoring the elderly, disregarding the homeless, prejudice against other races, carefree termination of the lives of unborn babies - attitudes all from the same root.</p>
<p>When we notice an attitude like that crop up in ourselves, it's easy to get disheartened. Maybe we overlook the class weirdo, don't make time for our neighbours when we meet or devalue people who are different to us. Even though we know that prejudice is wrong, a little bit can slip through the net.</p>
<p>First, there is forgiveness. Secondly, although evil will always be present in this life, we can defeat it. God gives us the means. He says, 'Don't just pretend that you love others: really love them. Hate what is wrong. Stand on the side of good. Love each other with brotherly affection and take delight in honouring each other... When others are happy, be happy with them. If they are sad, share their sorrow... Don't try to act big... And don't think you know it all! Never pay back evil for evil... Don't quarrel with anyone. Be at peace with everyone, just as much as possible... never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God, for He has said that He will repay those who deserve it... Don't let evil get the upper hand but conquer evil by doing good.'

<introtext><![CDATA['Learn to serve and...grow strong.' Ephesians 4:12 CEV<br /><br /><p>CS Lewis said, 'Joy bursts in on our lives when we go about doing the good at hand, and not trying to manipulate things and times to achieve joy.' Church isn't meant to be a place where everyone signs up to a serving roster out of obligation - far from it! God wants us <em>all</em> to participate in building His Kingdom, but our desire to do that comes from the inside out, and it can't be artificially planted on us from the outside in. When we serve out of our desire to please God, 'doing the good at hand' for Him, we will find joy. So find the place where you want to serve, and get at it!</p>
<p>Paul writes: 'Just as there are many parts to our bodies, so it is with Christ's body...God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, then prophesy whenever you can, as often as your faith is strong enough to receive a message from God. If your gift is that of serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, do a good job of teaching. If you are a preacher, see to it that your sermons are strong and helpful. If God has given you money, be generous in helping others with it...' (Romans 12:4-8 TLB)</p>
<p>God has given each one of us gifts. So let's use them: 'learn to serve and...grow strong.' If you're serving for any other reason than to please God, it's time to address your priorities. Put 'spending time with God' higher up your list and watch His presence flow through everything else you do.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 20-21, Mark 5:1-10, Ps 144:1-8, Pr 11:10-11<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone think less of you...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>You shouldn't be overlooked because of your age, your gender, your nationality, your education or your financial status. That's not the way that things should work in God's Kingdom. Take the example of Timothy, in the New Testament. Timothy started preaching in his teens. He became Paul's travelling companion, which was no small honour. But in those days, society said you didn't come into maturity until you were thirty, so Timothy wasn't seen as being qualified for leadership. Since Timothy was facing flak for this, Paul wrote to him, saying, 'Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.'</p>
<p>With God, it's not the length of your life that qualifies you to serve Him, but the depth of it. Look at Timothy's credentials! 'From childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures.' (2 Timothy 3:15 NKJ) Timothy had spent lots of time with God and was grounded in the truth. 'I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.' (2 Timothy 1:5 NIV) So Paul writes to the Philippian church and says: 'I hope...to send Timothy to you soon... I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because...he has served with me in the work of the Gospel.' (Philippians 2:19-22 NIV) The right to work in God's service isn't determined by your age: it comes by your experience with God, your growth in grace, and learning from His Word.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 22-23, Mark 5:11-20, Ps 144:9-15, Pr 11:12-13<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ<br /><br /><p>William Wilberforce was born in 1759 in England, the son of a wealthy merchant. After studying at Cambridge, Wilberforce became a member of parliament. But it was meeting John Newton that changed his life.</p>
<p>Before he became a Christian, Newton had captained a slave ship; but God convicted him of the horrors of slavery. He turned his life around, becoming a preacher and hymn writer. In fact, he wrote one of the most famous hymns of all time, <em>Amazing Grace</em>.</p>
<p>John Newton had a massive influence on Wilberforce. In 1787, Wilberforce initiated a campaign to make Great Britain aware of the atrocities of slavery and vote for its abolition. It was a fierce fight, and hard work. Politicians, industrialists, even religious leaders who had their own slaves opposed him. But William Wilberforce never gave up, always aware that the lives of millions of people were at stake. Twenty-six years later, near the end of Wilberforce's life, slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire.</p>
<p>'So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.' (Galatians 6:9 NLT) Wilberforce decided to take up the challenge in today's verse and he changed history!</p>
<p>Watch the film <em>Amazing Grace</em> with some friends - it is a truly inspirational story.</p><br /><br />SoulFood:Gal 5:22, Luke 10:25-37, Eph 4:31-32, Gen 50:15-21<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV<br /><br /><p>William Wilberforce not only enabled the British and American slave trade to be abolished, he was also a catalyst for the world choosing not to ignore - but to take responsibility for - the poor and suffering everywhere.</p>
<p>Earlier in his life, Wilberforce spent his life wining and dining and was touted as 'the wittiest man in all of England.' Looking back on that seemingly successful life, he wrote, 'For the first years I was in Parliament I did nothing - nothing of any purpose.' It was only when he committed his life to Christ that his life, attitude and passion changed and he found His life's purpose. In chasing after God's heart, he saved the life of millions! How much could we do if chose to do the same?</p>
<p>Wilberforce drew close to God, and because of that was moved to act on the sort of things that are close to God's heart. Ephesians 2:10 NIV tells us; 'we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' And what's really exciting is that God 'is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us.' (Ephesians 3:20 NIV) Pursue God, dream big and work very hard - and you could be the change you want to see in the world.</p>
<p>What change for the better would you like to see in our world? Make a short list and be specific. Search the web and find Christian charities that want the same change and discover how you can help too.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[praying-right]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['When you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong.' James 4:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Sometimes our prayers are 'me' centred where we treat God as a genie to be conjured up to fulfil our every wish. Then when we don't get what we want we think He doesn't hear, doesn't care, or maybe doesn't exist. James says, 'You...do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.' Selfishness is at the root of many unanswered prayers. The first 'ask' in the Lord's Prayer is 'Hallowed be Your name', the second 'Your Kingdom come' and the third, 'Your will be done.' (Matthew 6:9-10 NKJV) Our first concern in prayer is supposed to be what God wants, not what we want.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for praying right:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Ask God to slay your sinful nature</em>. Even though we are new creatures in Christ we still wrestle daily with our old nature. And when we're losing our prayers will be hindered. (2) <em>Ask Him to cleanse you</em>. You can't come into God's presence covered in sin; you must confess it and ask Him to forgive you. (3) <em>Ask Him to fill you with the Holy Spirit</em>. The indwelling of God's Spirit enables you to overcome temptation and live according to His will. (4) <em>Ask Him to guard and guide your steps</em>. God's plan for our lives is always better than best. (5) <em>Ask Him to use you for His glory</em>. Make yourself available as a servant with a willing heart to do whatever He asks. Why is this important? Because, prayer gets answered in ways you never imagined possible.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 27-28, Mark 5:31-43, Ps 94:12-23, Pr 11:16-18<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' Romans 12:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>The first Christians knew where they stood. They knew they were different to those around them, not just on the surface, but deep down. They had the Spirit of Christ in them; they'd been transferred from one life to another. Starting from that place, they then made a decision to enter the culture and society around them, bringing God's Kingdom in to affect their world just like yeast works in bread.</p>
<p>What about us? Have we got our perspective settled, do we know God's word? Or are we just made up of the same stuff as the world around us? If we don't get this one down, we'll struggle with questions like: How far can I go in this situation, in this party, with this boy/girl? We wind up going around in circles and never really surfacing into the freedom that God offers.</p>
<p>The Bible says that Christians are designed to '... shine among [others] like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the Word of life...' (Philippians 2:14-16 NIV) Designed to bring calm and peace into chaos, healing over sickness, and Jesus' new life into empty places. Designed to hold the Holy Spirit within us, as a precious gift. To do that though, we must have a new heart. It starts inside. Letting God in, we can live a life that is beautiful, graceful and magnetic but we have to repent, submit, and let Him do the work. So, where do you stand on this issue? Your decisions and actions should always take you closer to God, not away from Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 1-2, Mark 6:1-6, Ps 35, Pr 11:19-21<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not follow the crowd...' Exodus 23:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Mark D. Roberts writes: 'In [high school], a boy named Andrew was the classic nerd: overweight thick glasses skin so white it seemed hed never been outside. One day some of the boys began teasing Andrew and making fun of his appearance I saw the pain in his eyes and knew I should tell the other guys to knock it off. But I saw an opportunity to be aligned with the in-crowd. So I joined in adding my taunts as Andrew began to cry... In my heart I knew I'd done a terrible thing... Sometimes the temptation to follow the crowd is almost more than we can bear. We crave acceptance to such an extent that we do what we know is wrong so others will like us. This is true not only for insecure boys [in high school], but for just about everybody. It's hard to stand up to the crowd.'</p>
<p>Allowing anyone to feel unworthy or unloved is not ok. It's not how Jesus lived and it's not how He wants you to live.</p>
<p>Jesus was never led or swayed by other people's thoughts and opinions. Even His critics acknowledged, 'We know you are a man of integrity... You aren't swayed by [others].' (Matthew 22:16 NIV) When you truly know who you are in God, being desperate to impress an insecure, nasty crowd is a concern that just fizzles out. Knowing His love for you frees you from needing respect from unrespectable crowds. And if you feel like Andrew in the story, praise God that you can run into His love and shelter with a shield all around you to defend you from empty taunts!</p>
<p>You can ask God for strength anytime you need it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 3-4, Mark 6:7-13, Ps 2, Pr 11:22-23<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... You will understand later.' John 13:7 NCV<br /><br /><p>God doesn't just forgive and forget all the sins you know you've done in the past. He's already seen and forgiven any wrong you'll do in the future too. Remember how Jesus washed the disciples feet the night before He was crucified? The disciples struggled to get why Jesus was lowering Himself to one of the muckiest jobs around, but He told them they would understand later. You see, Jesus knew they were going to perform one of the worst deeds of history that very night: He knew they were going to desert Him. By morning they would bow their heads in shame, looking down at their feet, disgusted. And when they did, Jesus wanted them to remember that He had washed their feet.</p>
<p>See? He had given them mercy and forgiven their sin before they knew they had needed it. Stunned by His love, all but one of them would give back their lives in return - by giving everything they had to the Gospel. 'The blood of Jesus, God's Son, cleanses us from every sin.' (1 John 1:7 NCV) Jesus is still in the same business of washing us clean from our sins. And this clean-up is not a future promise but a reality, right now. Max Lucado said, 'Let a speck of dust fall on the soul of a saint, and it is washed away!'<strong><em> </em></strong>Read the story for yourself in John 13. Pay particular attention to Jesus' very human prayer about how He felt about the choice He made.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 5-7, Mark 6:14-29, Ps 37:1-7, Pr 11:24-26<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['[He] redeems your life from destruction...' Psalm 103:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>If you were asked to think of someone who had really let you down or broken a promise, sadly, you could probably think of more than one person. Maybe even people in your family. Turn the tables and you know that you could probably be accused of the same at some point in your life. Good news: <em>God'</em><em>s not like us</em>. The point of the covenant (promise) He's made with us (that's constantly being talked about in the Bible) is that He won't ever leave you, and He won't ever break His promises. That's the case no matter how you feel - God loves you just as much when you can't sleep for guilt as when you're living your life entirely on fire for Him. That's the case whoever has a go at you, whatever situations hit you or whatever seemingly-shaming mistakes you may make. Even when you are in the thick of all that feels wrong in your life, God is working all things in it for good.</p>
<p>He says He does that for all who love Him and are called by Him. Even when you don't realise He's doing it, He redeems your life from destruction Think about all the doors that have shut on you in the past, even those that you desperately wanted to open. Know this. God doesn't keep the best from His kids. It's against His nature as your heavenly Dad. But He may keep you from what <em>you</em> think is your best. He wants His perfect way in your life.

<introtext><![CDATA['... I have found my sheep which was lost.' Luke 15:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>A fun way to remember what's in Luke 15 is thinking of it as the lost property department. But unlike the sort of things you usually find there - worn-out shoes or mouldy Tupperware boxes - all these things are precious. Open your Bible up and take a look. There's the parable of the lost sheep, the lost silver coin, and the lost son. Let's start with the lost sheep story, Luke 15 verses 3 to 7. If you can, give it a read now, and then come back.</p>
<p>This parable shows us two amazing things about Jesus, our Shepherd. (1) <em>We get a real sense of how God values us.</em> It's easy to think that one sheep out of 100 might not be missed. But, just like shepherds would be compelled to track down a single missing sheep, the Good Shepherd was driven by His compassion to find us when we were lost. If you were to be the only person who ever sinned, Jesus would have gone to the cross and died for you! (2) <em>We see that God will go to amazing lengths to save you, because it is His joy to do it.</em> 'When [the shepherd] has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.' (Luke 15:5 NKJ) Jesus doesn't just save you then duck back into Heaven. He keeps you on His shoulders, bearing you up and giving you strength. His promise is, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJ)</p>
<p>If you're feeling lost today - being found is just a prayer away.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:22, Luke 6:27-36, Ex 23:1-9, Rom 12:14-21<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... I have found the piece [of silver] which I lost!' Luke 15:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Jesus' next parable was about a lost coin: 'What woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, saying, &quot;Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost.&quot;' (Luke 15:8-9 NKJ)</p>
<p>Let's bring out some detail in this story! The silver coin is an inanimate object. It had no feelings of being lost; it wasn't concerned about its own welfare. And it was lost, even though it was in the house. This itty-bitty parable is a big picture of people who sit in church and believe they are earning their way into Heaven by being good. They're as inanimate as the coin, not engaging at all with God's Spirit or His Word. But what did the woman in Jesus' story do to find the coin? She lit a lamp, she swept the house, and she searched for it until she found it.</p>
<p>That's what Bible-based teaching will do. He'll shake them loose from their safety and show them they need to be truly found by Him.</p>
<p>Through other hearts on fire for Him, Jesus wants to sweep out the clogging dust of misunderstanding that's in the way of people properly coming to Him. God wants to shine a light on the power of His Word, and show all His children their true value! <em>You</em> could be His chosen means of bringing them back to Him! So tell someone what your relationship with God means to you.

<introtext><![CDATA['... [My] son was lost, and is found.' Luke 15:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Last, but not least, it's the parable of the lost son. In this story the son <em>knew</em> he was lost - he knew his way home. No one came looking for him like the Shepherd seeking the sheep, or the woman seeking her coin.</p>
<p>In this story, after throwing his inheritance away, living recklessly on the best the world could offer, the son finds himself minding pigs. And he's jealous of their food. But in the pigsty he comes to his senses: 'I will go back to my father and say to him: &quot;Father, I have sinned,&quot;... But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him... the father said to his servants, &quot;Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet... Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was lost and is found...'&quot; (Luke 15:17-24 NIV)</p>
<p>The son didn't feel worthy of love, but all the father cared about was that his lost child had come home. And no sin exists greater than the love God the Father has for you. He'll act in <em>just</em> the same way as the father in this story. He will never give you the cold shoulder if you choose to run back to Him. He will always, always, welcome you home.</p>
<p>There's welcoming grace for you today.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 14-17, Mark 7:1-13, Ps 37:25-31, Pr 12:1-3<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Some parents brought their children to Jesus...' Mark 10:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jesus was teaching in Judea and drawing quite a crowd. People were also, 'bringing little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, He was indignant. He said to them, &quot;Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&quot;' (Mark 10:13NIV)</p>
<p>The disciples assumed Jesus wouldn't want to include the children. Instead Jesus was not only keen to allow them in, but to bless them too. We can easily have the same attitude and judgment as the disciples did with people who don't yet know Jesus. We can let our judgments take hold of us and assume that they won't want to hear the Good News because of their bold atheism, drug addiction or whatever.</p>
<p>But the Gospel, the Person of Jesus Christ, is not just for people who <em>you</em> think are fit to hear or most likely to listen. It's not your job to convince; it's your job to share. When we grow closer to Him, His life in us will become more magnetic to those around us. And we'll naturally start wanting to share the Gospel and be more open with people we wouldn't usually give a second look. Remember, often the people who are most passionately against Christianity can be the ones seeking the most, without them or us knowing it. Jesus was busy yet He made time to bless little children. The little children in our lives might be young or young in their faith but we too should look for opportunities to bless!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 18-21, Mark 7:14-23, Ps 37:32-40, Pr 12:4-6 <br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... You are precious to Me...' Isaiah 43:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>Look for love in the wrong places and you'll end up feeling like you've been chewed up and spat out. Even if you feel adored and respected one minute, you may end up feeling discarded and thrown away like old newspaper the next. Perhaps you've actually grown up with that sense of being discarded, unwanted and unloved. Maybe you feel or have felt unlovable.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: that sort of 'love' is a tremendous lie so it's a pleasure to introduce you to someone who sees you with a truer, clearer love. And He sees you as perfectly lovable! More than that, He put you together in your mother's womb, so as far as He's concerned you are a masterpiece. The security and stability in your worth comes from seeing yourself as God sees you. (1) <em>You'</em><em>re loveable to Him</em>, 'You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you...' (Isaiah 43:4-5) (2) <em>Valuable.</em> 'The Son of God, who loved [you], and gave Himself for [you].' (Galatians 2:20 NIV) Jesus gave His life for you so that you could have life and have it to the full! (3) <em>Capable.</em> You are God-made with God-given talents. He's '...given...you...special abilities...' (1 Peter 4:10 TLB) There are things that God has given only to you. And hope that God alone can give you. Turn to Him, and find love. Furthermore, He has '...seated us with Him in His heavenly Kingdom...' (Ephesians 2:6 NIV) So stay in your seat and don't let anybody tell you that your life doesn't matter. It does, because God says so!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Luke 24:50-53, Acts 1:1-11, Eph 4:7-10<br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness...' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>When we feel incapable or not strong enough in our own efforts we can feel tempted to rely on other things to help us through. It's no secret that celebrities often turn to drugs to deal with their constant goldfish bowl existence in the public eye. Jason Donovan, star of the TV show <em>Neighbours</em>, once said that off drugs he just wanted to get away from everyone, but on them he felt like the master of the party. But the 'strength' he found in drugs almost killed him.</p>
<p>When you are feeling weak or unable to cope, God says not only can He cope with it, but that, actually, His strength is perfected in our weakness. So long as we are relying completely on Him. When we feel too weak to resist temptation, Paul's answer is this: 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) Peace in God's strength is actually a choice. We have to listen to Him.</p>
<p>Constantly dwelling on a weakness just reinforces it, whereas applying the Scriptural solution brings results. And the good news is, you don't have to do it alone. God is available to help you. He told Paul, '...My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness...'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'There is another power within me that is at war with my mind...' Romans 7:23 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p>It's a famous story: <em>A suicide note is found at the body of a brilliant doctor. The genius has created a potion which enables a person to behave in ways uncharacteristic of themselves. The potion takes away the things that bind and opens up a new freedom and courage. Except the freedom sets loose a savage. No longer sensitive to the lives of others, the potion encourages wild selfish mood swings and awakens deadly desires. Soon murder is permissible; nothing stands in the way of the selfish desire. It's like a destructive alter-ego birthed in man. The story is Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and at its end, the doctor sees no alternative but suicide - only then will he be rid of his soul's dark shadow, Mr Hyde.</em></p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson's famous dark tale serves as a warning to us about the monster within. Paul is only too aware of our Jekyll-and-Hyde nature, 'I love God's law with all my heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me.' (Romans 7:22-23 NLT) No potion necessary, we all have a wild savage let loose inside us. The trick is to starve Mr Hyde and feed Dr Jekyll. Feed your prayer life; starve your wild thought-life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘You have…put a wall of protection around him.’ Job 1:10 NLT</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Job was at his wit’s end. His body was in excruciating pain with scabs and broken flesh where disease had eaten away at him. He was exhausted from the sleepless nights when dark thoughts raced around his mind. Grief weighed down like a stone on his chest. His marriage was in tatters, his children all dead when they’d gone to a party and the roof had collapsed on them. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>He’d obeyed God all his life. Surely that should have counted for something? Why was God punishing him? It didn’t make sense. God had always protected him previously. But the situation was so bad, death couldn’t be any worse.</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>At last, seemingly long overdue, God stepped into the picture, armed with healing and restoration. Finally, the breath of resurrection blew into the room. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>And the same promise is for you when your world crumbles around you. When your mind, your health, or your relationships are attacked, the pain is raw and real. But it’s only for a time. God won’t allow more pain than you can possibly endure. Just when you think it’s impossible to take any more, the breath of resurrection will blow into your room. God’s promises are true. ‘</span><span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ (Psalm 147:3 NIV) And</span><span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Cambria','serif';&quot;>... ‘</span></span><span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.’ James 1:12</span></span><span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Cambria','serif';&quot;> (NIV)</span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;> <span>‘…No man ever spoke like this Man!’ John 7:46 NKJ</span></span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The power of words: words can be like a mask you hide behind; words can set a spark in someone’s heart; words can cut a scar into another; words can comfort; words can destroy; words send the tanks in; words sign the peace treaty; the world turns on words. It’s no surprise then that John starts his Gospel off referring to Jesus as the Word of God. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Think for a second about the power of Jesus’ words: ordinary uneducated fishermen sparked a revolution that is still unfolding today because of these words; monks would spend all night by candlelight turning over these words in their minds; slave-traders would unlock shackles at the force of these words; cathedrals, paintings, frescoes, poems, plays, books and films would shoot into existence inspired by these words; the Salvation Army would create a blueprint for the modern welfare system stirred by these words; alcoholics put down bottles, cancers pack their bags, addicts bin their needles — and all because of Jesus’ words. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>History shows that words change people. And words can change you too - if you let them. Which of Jesus words are your favourites? Journal them or write them in a place that you’ll return to, and open yourself up to being changed by them. Then when you need inspiration, a pick-me-up, comfort, healing, truth or encouragement — choose one of those highlighted diamonds from the mind of Jesus.</span></p>

<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘… Deliver us from the evil one...’ Matthew 6:13 NKJ</span></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Our last look at the Lord’s Prayer starts with a question: What do you pray when temptation is crawling up your collar? Answer: ‘Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one...’ (Matthew 6:13 NKJ) </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>It’s not God who dangles the carrot of temptation: we have certain pulls and desires within us, and Satan wants to jump on them. Therefore we pray for God to save us from ourselves and to deliver us, or rescue us, from the evil one’s exploitative traps. Here’s the good news then: if we bring our weaknesses to God, not only does He work on our behalf; in the process we get closer to Him. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Paul had this one sussed: ‘I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me.’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) Paul actually boasts — yes, boasts! — about his weaknesses: ‘...</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>to keep me from being puffed up with pride...I was given a painful physical ailment, which acts as Satan’s messenger to...keep me from being proud</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>…’ (2 Corinthians 12:7 GNT) You’ll often find a weakness attached to strength, acting as a governor to keep you from becoming boastful or running ahead of God. Gideon chose 32,000 men to fight the Midianites, but God reduced his numbers to 300 (see Judges 7). Why? So that Israel would know it was God’s power and not their own that saved them.</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Your most painful area of weakness CAN become your area of greatest strength: so, pray into it, hard, and watch yourself walk more and more closely with God at the same time. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘…Forgive us…as we forgive...’ Matthew 6:12 NKJ</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>So far, so good with our trip through the Lord’s Prayer. We’ve reminded ourselves that God is our Father and He wants what is best for us. We’ve thought about being dependent on our heavenly Father as He provides bread for us both physically and spiritually. And today Jesus asks us to think about speaking well of the people who have crushed and stamped on our hearts. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Sorry, run that last one by us again, Jesus? Surely you mean us to pray for God to send a lightning bolt to zap our enemies, right? Surely there’s a typo in your words, ‘Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors’? We can live with the first bit — we’ve run up enormous debts against God, but He forgives us. But what’s that about me forgiving that vermin who’s ruined my life? Are you serious?! </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Jesus majors on extending mercy to those who don’t deserve it. After all, where would we be if God held a grudge? So Jesus wants us to practice letting go of our grudges. There is no resentment in Heaven and God wants us to start living like that now on earth. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you forgive the person who has wronged you. If you’re feeling even braver, ask God to doubly bless them — that really is what Jesus loves!</span></p>

<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Fresh bread mmm... that lovely smell that wafts from the bakery... </span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Jesus taught, <i>'Give us this day our daily bread.'</i> Notice the word 'daily'. That’s because you can't fight today's battles on the strength of yesterday's bread. In the wilderness God's people were only permitted to collect enough manna for one day. If they tried to collect more, it rotted. It's wonderful to talk about what God did yesterday and what He's going to do tomorrow, but all you've got is today. 'Give us this day our daily bread. What God's provided for you today is what you need to stand up to the challenges you face. This prayer is an expression of faith. The very act of asking shows you believe God's got what you need and that He cares enough to provide for you. It says, 'I don't need to go to anybody else but You, Lord.' So turn off your phone, computer and TV, shut the door, get down on your knees, approach God in faith and </span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>pray, 'Give me what I need for this day.' God knows what you need, you don't! And He’ll provide for you today so you'll be able to handle whatever life throws at you. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘Therefore, pray…Our Father in Heaven...’ Matthew 6:9 NKJ</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The disciples genuinely wanted to get close to God, but they didn’t always know how. However they did know Jesus would hold the key. Their request has left us the most beautiful prayer ever. (1) <i>'Our Father in Heaven.'</i> When you say, 'Father' you’re acknowledging that you're 'family', that you have a special relationship with God which entitles you to go to Him at any time, confident you're loved, welcomed and assured of His favour. When you say, 'in Heaven,' you can go no higher. You're putting your request to the ultimate source of goodness, grace, mercy, provision, protection and authority. What a privilege! (2) <i>'Hallowed be Your name.'</i> (Matthew 6:9 NKJ) Whatever you do today, whether in thought, word or deed, let it honour God. People should be able to look at your life and want to become acquainted with the One you serve. (3) <i>'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.' </i>(Matthew 6:10 NKJ) Each time you choose to say no to yourself and yes to God's will, you demonstrate to a watching world what it means to live as a citizen of His Kingdom. Note the words, 'as it is in Heaven.' Is anyone in Heaven fearful or doubting? Stubborn or disobedient? Critical or negative? When you come across something that's contrary to God's will, you have the authority to rise up and say, 'If it's not done and approved in Heaven it has no place in my life here on earth.' The one thing Satan hopes you never discover is that you have the God-given authority to restrict his movements in your life.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.’ Romans 10:17 NKJ</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Millions of people around the world foolishly depend on horoscopes for their daily dose of wisdom. They see the Bible as old and outdated and so would rather put their trust in an unknown group of people who’ll interpret the movements of exploding spheres of gas zillions of kilometres away to advise them on whether they’ll have a good or bad day.</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Trust a bunch of strangers or turn to God? Tough choice! There is so much wisdom in the Bible and you don’t even need special training (although that’s a good idea too). You can start simply by opening it. In it you’ll find the stories of God’s dealings with people throughout history. It’s a book that has repeatedly proven helpful in grounding, correcting and inspiring countless people for thousands of years. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The latest celebrity songsters may have the odd clever sound byte, but will we be combing the lyrics of pop-stars for life guidance in two thousand years time? True, the Bible is longer than the average song. But, did you know it is possible to read the entire New Testament in a month by reading just nine chapters every day? No more excuses — get stuck into your Bible! </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Here’s a helpful checklist: (1) Find a translation that floats your boat. (2) Don’t use it as a lucky dip — have a systematic plan. (3) Follow the plan but don’t have a guilt trip if you miss a day. If you start <i>SoulFood </i>today, you’ll have read your whole Bible in a year. (4) Expect that God will speak to you.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ Proverbs 16:3 NIV</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>It seems like too good to be true, doesn’t it? ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ Now, it doesn’t say, ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed <i>at once</i>.’ Or <i>without any effort on your part</i>. Or <i>without any mistakes along the way</i>. God didn’t say you wouldn’t stumble. He just promises to pick you up when you do, dust you off, correct you when you need it and keep on keeping on with you. ‘The Lord directs the steps of the godly... Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.’ (Psalm 37: 23-24 NLT) So don’t get bent out of shape when things don’t work out perfectly — by God’s grace, you’re still heading towards the goal He’s helping you achieve. Remember: God can bring good out of bad situations. Out of the ashes of a disaster, He can create astonishing beauty. (That’s one of the reasons why He’s God!) ‘God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.’(Romans 8:28 NLT) So, don’t give up if you’re hitting struggles and setbacks. Success awaits those who do not give up! </span></p>

<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>By now, you’ve probably been warned a few times about the perils and pitfalls of making a bad decision. And that’s wise.</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>But sometimes paralysis — just sitting there and not making that all-important decision — can be just as risky. Picture a donkey standing between two bales of hay, unable to decide which one to eat and afraid of making the wrong choice. Eventually he just starves to death!</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>So how can you avoid being an ass? (1) <i>Stop trying to please everybody</i>. ‘Fear of man is a dangerous trap, but to trust in God means safety.’ (Proverbs 29:25 TLB) Once you know God’s will, don’t be thrown off track by others. (2) <i>When God is on your side, you’ll succeed.</i> Fear of failure can stop you going places but fear is just an emotion. God’s Word, on the other hand, is unshakeable: ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ (Proverbs 16:3 NIV) (3) <i>Stay in tune, stay on track</i>. As long as you keep close to God in prayer, your steps can’t fail. ‘</span><span class=&quot;wordsofchrist&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ (John 8:12 NIV) So pray!</span></p>

<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>There’s a story </span></span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>about a guy named Bill. He phoned his boss and said: ‘I believe you’re looking for an experienced, talented, hard-working manager for your office. I’d like to apply for the position.’ The boss replied, ‘We already have someone in that job and he’s excellent. By the way, your voice sounds familiar. Do I know you?’ The guy replied, ‘It’s me Bill; I was just checking up on myself!’ </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Just like Bill, you need to check up on yourself regularly. </span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>You need to invite God to cross-examine every detail of your case, scrutinise the facts, expose any corruption and get to the truth, no matter how deep He has to dig. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>When we invite the Holy Spirit to scrutinise us, He makes us aware of the stuff that doesn’t add up. The dirty secrets we’d like to keep dead and buried rise to the top. Confronted with our darkness and sin, we have some options: to justify why we did it or to ask God to deal with it. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The Psalmist prayed: 'I have tried to keep Your laws and have trusted You without wavering. Cross-examine me, O Lord...test my motives and affections too. For I have taken Your loving-kindness and Your truth as my ideals.' (Psalm 26:1-3 TLB) It may not be nice facing up to our sin but it certainly benefits us. Confession opens up forgiveness. And forgiveness sets a prisoner free: you.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘… Keep your conscience clear...’ 1 Timothy 1:19 NLT</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Paul insists we know the difference between right and wrong. No matter what advantages there are in twisting our sense of right, Paul warns us to stay God’s side of the fence. He lays it on the line to Timothy: ‘Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.’ </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Now, a captain doesn’t set out to wreck his ship. But if he falls asleep at the wheel or takes his eye off the compass, he will end up on the rocks anyway. The question is not, ‘Can I get away with it?’ No, the question is, ‘Can I live with it afterwards? How will it affect my confidence before God? How does He feel about it? Who am I trying to please?’ </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>In Romans 14:23 NLT, he gives another warning: ‘</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>But if people have doubts about whether they should [do] something, they shouldn't [do] it. They would be condemned for not acting in faith before God. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ After all what good is it to receive everybody’s respect but not deserve it? Keep your life clean and clear before God.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘God…made Jesus perfect by suffering.’ Hebrews 2:10 CEV</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The angel of death passed over every home smeared with lamb or goat blood. Yet that was specific to that particular story in the Bible (find it in Exodus 12). Cancer doesn’t skip your house just because there’s a ‘Shalom’ sign hung on the wall. Debt doesn’t leave you alone just because there is a Christian fish sticker on your car bumper. Weekly attendance at church doesn’t send suffering an ‘excuse me’ note. The best of us will have our dose of pain. It’s part and parcel of the ride. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Jesus gives Peter a verbal slap</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>-</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>on</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>-</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>the</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>-</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>wrist when he suggests that Christ should not suffer, ‘Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block…you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men…If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself…take up his cross.’ (Matthew 16:23-24 NIV) Harsh words. But let’s not be surprised when misery knocks on our door. Jesus has promised it. God uses suffering to make us more Christ-like. ‘</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>It was good that I had to suffer in order to learn Your laws.</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ (Psalm 119:71 GWT) Remember, it's by His wounds we are healed (Isaiah 53:5), and by His weakness that we are made strong.</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘God…made Jesus perfect by suffering.’ Hebrews 2:10 CEV</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The Bible says, ‘God…made Jesus perfect by suffering.’ Pain is a learning experience. A friend cheats on us, an illness steals our youth, a parent abandons us — none of us escapes pain. Even ‘Jesus…had to suffer before He could learn what it really means to obey God.’ (Hebrews 5:8 CEV) </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Philip Yancey writes: ‘God understood physical pain, having designed the marvellous nervous system that warns against harm… In thirty-three years on earth Jesus learned about hardship, rejection and betrayal. And He learned too about pain: what it feels like to have an accuser leave the red imprint of his fingers on your face…to have a crude iron spike pounded through muscle, tendon, and bone. On earth, the Son of God learned all that.’ </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Jesus took His degree in suffering. A lone man abandoned by His friends, nailed naked on a cross — at one point He even feels abandoned by God. Everything He has lived for seemed lost. And when we cry at the storm clouds, ‘God, where are You?’ we know Jesus has been there too. By joining us on earth, Jesus gave visible, historical proof that God hears our groans and groans along with us. Suffering isn’t the last word, resurrection is. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘… Be it known…that we will not ...’ Daniel 3:18 KJV</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Wonder what the final thoughts of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were as they were carried towards the furnace? Perhaps there were a few last flashes of doubt as they were dragged to the ovens. Did Shadrach think, ‘Nobody else is risking martyrdom — why should I?’ Or what about Meshach? ‘Better a live dog than a dead lion. If we stay alive, maybe we can do good for God and for others?’ Possibly Abednego wavered as the heat began to warm his cheeks, ‘Where are You, Lord?’ </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Doubt, reason, self-pity can all impinge on our journey of faith, rightly or wrongly. But what’s so commendable about this situation is that neither logic, nor emotion, nor circumstance could separate these Hebrew boys from their conviction in God. They were prepared to die for what they believed.</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>If you want a faith that goes down in history (whether that’s earth’s history books or Heaven’s scrolls!), you’ll need a priority list that has ‘God’ written at #1. God must be the ruler of logic, fear, situation, danger — the lot. These guys put their faith on the line in the public domain with everyone watching. The result: a whole nation turned its heart back to God. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Paul said, ‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.’ (Philippians 4:13 NKJ) So if the spotlight ever turns on you, do you want to be able to stand strong with God? Those who answered ‘yes’ had best get ready for the flames. In your prayer times today, ask God to increase your capacity to grow and your capacity to cope. <span style=&quot;background: lime;&quot;></span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘David inquired again of God…’ 1 Chronicles 14:14 NKJ</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Picture this: the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army holds a phone to his ear. The enemy’s closing in. Fighter jets are tearing through the sky. Battleships are moving in. And still the Prime Minister refuses to act. ‘Prime Minister, this is a red alert,’ the head of the army bawls into the phone. ‘If we don’t fight back now; Australia will be enemy-occupied territory. When do you want us to issue orders to attack?’ ‘Not yet,’ a cool-headed PM replies. ‘Then when?’ There is a pause, as if the PM is listening to a higher power. ‘When you hear the sound of leaves rustling in the treetops — then you will know it is the moment to move. Then and only then, give the signal!’ </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Yeah, right! Yet David does almost exactly this in 1 Chronicles 14 (check it out for yourself). So attuned to God is this giant-slayer that he is willing to ignore all danger signs in favour of an odd piece of strategy, dreamed up through prayer. David gets his victory because he will not make a move without first consulting God. David waited upon a sound. He knew the voice of God so well he could recognise it in the movement of mulberry bushes. David put faith over logic. He knew God would not fail him — the real question was, would he fail God? </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Bottom line: When God speaks (compare His words with the Bible to check it sounds like Him!), no matter how bizarre the request, follow it through. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>‘… Be it known…that we will not...’ Daniel 3:18 KJV</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>All through life you’ll come across people who will try to control you. Their threats can sound real, and the consequences of ignoring them, intimidating. Look at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their commitment to God landed them in a fiery furnace hotter than the inside of a volcano. But it also promoted them to a place of huge blessing and influence. Their story in Daniel 3 teaches us that in a real test of character the outcome is not in your hands. You make the choice to do what is right before God and leave the consequences to Him. It's a trial by fire, but it's a fire of refinement, and on the other side of it you come out stronger. Each time you do the right thing, choosing to walk rather than escape the path God has called you on, you enter a new level of freedom. And as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego discovered, three things happen: (1) You are set free from the 'Nebuchadnezzars' who claim to have control over the outcome of your life. (2) You are set free to say 'no' to those who would try to use and manipulate you. (3) You are set free to serve your all-powerful King and say 'no' to all the other pretenders who really have no power over you at all. In that moment you not only gain insight into who you are, but more importantly, Whose you are. And God will do one of two things: develop you in the fiery furnace or deliver you from it. He may even do both!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>‘There is another power within me that is at war with my mind…’ Romans 7:23 NLT</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>It’s a famous story: <i>A suicide note is found at the body of a brilliant doctor. The genius has created a potion which enables a person to behave in ways uncharacteristic of themselves. The potion takes away the things that bind and opens up a new freedom and courage. Except the freedom sets loose a savage. No longer sensitive to the lives of others, the potion encourages wild selfish mood swings and awakens deadly desires. Soon murder is permissible; nothing stands in the way of the selfish desire. It’s like a destructive alter-ego birthed in man.</i> The story is Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and at its end, the doctor sees no alternative but suicide — only then will he be rid of his soul’s dark shadow, Mr Hyde. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous dark tale serves as a warning to us about the monster within. Paul is only too aware of our Jekyll-and-Hyde nature, ‘I love God’s law with all my heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me.’ (Romans 7:22-23 NLT) No potion necessary, we all have a wild savage let loose inside us. The trick is to starve Mr Hyde and feed Dr Jekyll. Feed your prayer life; starve your wild thought-life. Feed your Bible reading; starve your sin. Feed your values; starve temptation. Spend time with friends talking about the things of God.</span></p>

<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>What are your eyes fixed on? Fame? The trouble with fame is, it’s one big popularity contest. In order to stay popular you have to keep up with the times. But the times change and so do you. You have to change to fit in and you can forget who you are in the first place. Is this why so many celebs end up in a mess? </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Maybe your eye is fixed on money. The trouble with money is, how much is enough? There is always somebody richer; there will always be something just too expensive for you to buy. How much does a rich person need? Answer: just a little bit more. Is this why the saying goes: ‘money can’t buy happiness’? </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Or perhaps your eye is focused on pleasure. The problem with pleasure is, the heart is never satisfied. Thrills promise satisfaction but soon the buzz is gone and the heart wants more, only this time bigger and better. Is this how addiction grows? </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Only with eyes fixed on Jesus can we find what our souls truly crave. God made us so God understands what we need to feel alive — really alive. <b><i> </i></b>‘</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Indulging in luxuries, wine, and rich food will never make you [rich].</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ (Proverbs 21:17 GNT) To be rich in God, we need to fix our eyes on Him and pursue the lifestyle He wants, rather than one of pleasure, thrill and success. ‘Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.’ (Matthew 6:33 NLT)</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;></span></p>

Not even Jesus managed to achieve that. Even after forty days of prayer and fasting, Satan tempted Him. You are as open to attack after a great spiritual experience as you are in your lowest moments. Satan understood Jesus’ assignment and he was out to stop Him from accomplishing it. And he is out to stop you too! But how did Jesus stop Satan in his tracks? With the Word of God! So, which Scriptures have you memorised to help you conquer the tempter when he comes storming against you? What are your areas of weakness? </span><span style=&quot;color: windowtext; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>Don’t be ashamed to admit your struggles to God because remember He knows what it is like to be tempted. Pray for His help to stand strong. Like Jesus, memorise a verse to say aloud when temptation comes your way. (You could search biblegateway.com for suitable passages.)</span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>‘…And they chose…Philip...’ Acts 6:5 NKJ</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>The Bible says: ‘</span><span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>We reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist...</span></span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;> He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ (Acts 21:8-9 NIV) Philip was obviously a family man as well as a God-getting hero. He was the leader of one of the first, fastest-growing churches. He risked his life in the desert. He spoke to thousands from a platform. But the Bible takes time to point out one of his biggest heroic feats: being a good dad. </span></span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>See, with God, people are always more important than projects. What use is your Grammy-winning Gospel album if you’ve trodden on your producer to get it made? What good is your Youth Group if you’ve deliberately avoided inviting the kids from the local neighbourhood? What good are projects at the expense of people? </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>Philip’s diary must have been fit to burst with opportunity, and yet he still has time to nurture his family. And so must we avoid prioritising the latest opportunity over people who need us most. Perhaps your biggest display of the reality of the Gospel today might be phoning your gran, or checking in with ones of the lonely oldies from church. People, not projects, are what it’s about. Neglecting people is never good, spending quality time with someone is. Switching off your phone and giving them your full attention shows you care. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>‘… And they chose…Philip.’ Acts 6:5 NKJ</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>Philip was one of seven men chosen to lead the church in its early days, just after Jesus returned to Heaven. He was off conducting a city-wide crusade when God sent an angel with a message. ‘Head off into the desert. I’ve got a job for you.’</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>The <i>desert</i>?! Philip would have been scratching his head, wondering. He was needed right where he was: people were coming to believe in Jesus and well, you know how it is, Lord! You’ve got to seize the day.</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>But Philip left his comfort zone and stepped out to make some serious history. For on the desert road he met an eunuch who was secretary to the Queen of Ethiopia. The eunuch was reading the prophecy of Isaiah and puzzling over what it meant. And Philip was just the man to explain it. That chance encounter led the stranger to Christ and an entire nation to salvation. All because Philip was prepared to leave security behind and venture to the unknown, step by step with God. ‘</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>So those who suffer as God wants should trust their souls to the faithful Creator as they continue to do what is right.</span><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>’ (1 Peter 4:19 NCV) Are you willing to be a Philip? The courage you need s just a prayer away. </span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve the Lord with gladness...' Psalm 100:2 KJV<br /><br /><p>You know those people who talk themselves up and can't help letting you know how wonderful they are? You can't think what you did to encourage them other than smile and say, 'Hi!'</p>
<p>Paul writes 'You may brag about yourself, but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 CEV) </p>
<p>If your self-worth is based on anything other than God's approval, you won't serve with the right motives. Insecure people worry about how they'll be perceived by others: they hide their weaknesses beneath layers of protective pride. The more insecure you are, the more you need people to serve you, and the more you work for their acceptance. The thing is, if we hold other people's opinions of us above God's, we can stop being obedient to Him because we're too worried and stifled by what other people think. No wonder Paul writes, 'let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.' (Hebrews 12:1 NIV)</p>
<p>Free yourself from being trapped by concern over the thoughts and opinions of others. Make it easier on yourself and let your heart be glad to be released. Serve the Lord and every day make time to worship Him and pray. It is God we need to serve with gladness and we start by serving others!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>‘Watch out that no…bitterness grows up...’ Hebrews 12:15 NLT</span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>Jesus knew that one of His closest friends would betray Him. Perhaps Judas wasn’t in it entirely for the thirty pieces of silver. Perhaps he was just frustrated that Jesus was healing the sick and feeding thousands of people when He could have been challenging the might of Rome. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;>But if he was, Judas got it all wrong. He and Jesus were travelling on two completely different paths. The Messiah didn’t whip up a crowd of angry rebels from the streets into an uprising to oust the Romans. Instead, Jesus walked a solitary trail to the cross. And there was no sign of bitterness from Him. He didn’t call on the disciples to take revenge for the injustice done to Him. He didn’t pounce on Peter for turning chicken before the rooster crowed. He didn’t press the delete button on Thomas’ doubts. Jesus knew His destiny and no bitterness, betrayal or doubt would throw Him off course. </span></p>
<p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;>There’s a lesson for us. When friends turn their back on us, colleagues doubt us or other people blank us, stay on the track God has laid out. No swerving off on Resentment Road or Sour Taste Street. If there’s someone you’re holding a grudge against, ask for God’s help to forgive, and the power to let go. The Bible says ‘Get rid of all bitterness… Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.’ (Ephesians 4:31-32 NLT) </span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['What the law was powerless to do...God did by sending His own Son.' Romans 8:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>God is good, God is in control, God desires to be in a relationship with us. But - and it's a big BUT - if we're not properly sorted in that relationship with God, we're in big trouble!</p>
<p>That's because we all do wrong and fall short of God. We sin. Some sins are bigger and some are smaller. But a fall from God, whether it's big or small, is a fall from the highest height in the universe. We've hit rock bottom, all of us - no matter how good we think we are. That's the state of humanity, and it isn't pretty. We're scrabbling in the dirt, living our lives without God. So where do we go from here?</p>
<p>There is a way back. To scale back up the height we've fallen takes more than the most colossal effort. It would take a human being with more than a good track record. It would take someone perfect. The question posed by Christianity is: 'What if that person existed?'</p>
<p>'God loved the world so much that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him may not die but have eternal life.' (John 3:16 GNT) A friend at <em>word4U2day</em> HQ tweeted recently, 'Jesus came not to rub it in, but to rub it out.'</p>
<p>You have a problem. But. You are forgiven. Jesus' offer is right off the 'too good to be true' scale, but it needs a response from you to make it real in your life. You have to let Him sort your problem out and now is the time.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith without deeds is dead.' James 2:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>If one of your friends told you that his mum was seriously ill and he was scared about the test results, would you say, 'I'll keep my fingers crossed for you?' It's the thought that counts, but we all know that's a bit pointless, really. 'By the power of these nimble digits, let the results be OK!' </p>
<p>Likewise, if you say, 'I'll pray for her' and then never give it a second thought, why bother even saying that you will? James (Jesus' half-brother, with a book of his very own in the New Testament) says there's no point to our faith unless we do good deeds. He gives this example: 'Does merely talking about faith indicate that a person really has it? For instance, if a person comes upon an old friend dressed in rags and half-starved and says, Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed, but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.' (James 2:15-17 NIV) A read through the book of James (it's not long) will help you understand how we should live out our faith in our words and deeds! </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I chose you...to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last.' John 15:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus told His disciples that they were branches - remember the reading way back on November 18? Jesus was saying that we are the branches and He is the vine. If a branch isn't attached to anything it can't produce any fruit. (In fact, Jesus goes as far as to say, 'apart from Me you can do nothing' in verse 5). Wondering about what fruit your life will bear? It's only through your relationship with Jesus that you can find out who you really are, whether you're a Galatians 5:19-21 (rotten fruit) or Galatians 5:22-24 (super fruit) kind of guy or gal, and the extent of how you can use your God-given gifts. Your strength and success is in Jesus. </p>
<p>That's not the end of it, though. We all know that not all of the 'fruit' we produce would get God's tick of approval. Some branches need to be cut down - pruned. God even can take away things in your life which are an investment in your security or self-esteem. This can feel like God is hacking away at you rather than looking after you. But God is preparing and shaping you for greater things to come. Here's a thought, how does your relationship with God compare with the one Jesus talks about in John 15? (This chapter also tells you plain and simple 'Jesus loves you'.)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God ...will fulfil His purpose for (you).' Psalm 57:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>What might seem to be Plan B to us is no surprise to God. He's seen it all - people throughout all of history have been making a mess of Plan A and then wondering what on earth to do next with their life. </p>
<p>'What if I mess it up?' we ask. 'What if I get in the way of what God wants to do in my life?' The Father of all creation is big enough to deal with your mess. He's creative enough to make a masterpiece out of the second-rate ingredients we offer Him. It's right there in the Bible: 'And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.' (Romans 8:28 NLT)</p>
<p>It doesn't say that He works all things for good when you're on your 'A' game or on your best day. No, the Bible says, '...He makes everything work out according to His plan.' (Ephesians 1:11 NLT) That means He's seen it all coming, and what might seem to be Plan B to us is, somehow...still...Plan A for God! </p>
<p>God will ultimately work all things for good - but what about the way we start? In Matthew 6:10 NKJ Jesus prayed, 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.' That's a great prayer to start your day. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Would you ever accuse someone of something you would excuse in yourself? Never?</p>
<p>While confronting David over his sin with Bathsheba, Nathan the prophet told the king a story about two men. A rich man with many sheep and cattle and a poor man with only one lamb. When a guest came to the rich man's house for dinner, he took the poor man's lamb. 'David's anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said, ...the man who has done this shall surely die! And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb...because he had no pity. Then Nathan said to David, You are the man!' (2 Samuel 12:5-7 NKJ)</p>
<p>You see, the story Nathan told had David's name written all over it. It broke though the pride that was blinding David to his sin. David finally repented and got right with God.</p>
<p>We can very easily do the same. We can slam others for spreading gossip on Facebook but relish telling close friends juicy secrets we've heard. We're quick to condemn politicians and public figures for dishonest dealings even while our own affairs are not exactly whiter-than-white. Sometimes, like David, we don't even notice we're doing it. We need to keep watch over our hearts and make sure our hands are clean of hypocrisy. Scholars believe David wrote Psalm 51 ('Create in me a pure heart, O God...') at this time. His words are a powerful example for us of how <em>'a man after God's own heart'</em> repents.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Once upon a time, as the famous fable tells, there was a contest between Wind and Sun. They fought to see who could remove the coat of a man walking down a street. Wind had no doubt about its ability, so it simply blew great gusts of air down with all its strength. But it hadn't thought ahead - the man felt Wind billowing around him, and pulled his coat closer around himself. Sun looked down and took its turn. It shone lovely warm rays down onto the man, and shone and shone. Eventually, the man became too warm, and he gladly removed his coat to enjoy the sunshine! Where Wind had tried to use brute strength to force what it wanted, Sun worked persuasively, drawing the man towards what it wanted. </p>
<p>God is like that with us. He won't force His will on us, but will work with us. He loves us as we are right now - every part of us - but He wants to grow us, and develop us into healthy children of His. Ever wondered what people mean when they talk about being in a 'relationship with God'? Well, that's it!</p>
<p>What's your response to that sort of love? Don't just rely on word4U2day for your 'daily God intake'. Let God's Holy Spirit in on the action too. When we allow ourselves to be led by His Spirit, we enter a real conversation with God. 'Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.' (James 4:8 ESV) The more we give Him time and the more we draw near to hear His voice, the more we'll come to realise there's no friend closer. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Here's a healthy bite of truth to chew on: 'For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 8:38-39 NIV)</p>
<p>Salvation doesn't stop at the cross. Jesus came back to life and will always intercede for us; will always, in effect, be 'saving' us. The love of God to man shown through Jesus is always trustworthy, total and never unsteady. These are amazing verses. It's so important to let the goodness of this good news cancel out any shame and guilt that may stop us from running back to our heavenly Dad to repent when we've messed up. The enemy will try and keep you away from God by telling you that you are no longer fit to be in His presence: 'You're not good enough. You're not worthy.' The truth is, we never were. It's only by Jesus' blood that we are made holy enough in the first place. We pray to God in Jesus' name and it's by His name that God answers. That's why we can come boldly. We need to keep coming back to this truth - it's where our faith starts and ends.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>When we sin, it doesn't 'just happen' - like we tripped over a rock in the road. Sin in our lives doesn't come out of nowhere. The Bible says, 'Temptation comes from the lure of our own evil desires. These evil desires give birth to evil actions, and evil actions lead to death.' (James 1:14-15 NLT)</p>
<p>Sin starts in the mind - when we allow our thoughts the freedom to roam as they please. What we feast on in our minds always affects the rest of us too. Being tempted is <em>not a sin in itself</em>, but choosing to give over to it in fantasy or action is. The Bible says: 'Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.' (Romans 8:5 NIV)</p>
<p>Healthy bodies need healthy diets. So let your mind feast on the good stuff: 'Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.' (Philippians 4:8 NIV) God is able to show you the areas of your thought-life that need to change. Let Him show you the core of why you're being tempted.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />word4U2day <i>(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)</i> is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we saw the importance of keeping our thought-life in check because sin often enters our lives through temptation. But there's another area where our thoughts can cause us to sin: the failings of other people.</p>
<p>When people upset us or let us down, it's easy to dwell on how much they've hurt us. But all that hanging on to past resentment does is churn away at your insides and infect future relationships. We end up passing on our hurt to other people, rather than forgiving and moving on.</p>
<p>God said this, through Paul: 'Don't sin by letting anger control you. Don't let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil... And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, He has identified you as His own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour. Instead, be kind to each other, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.' (Ephesians 4:26-32 NLT)</p>
<p>Forgiveness can seem impossible. 'Why am I the one who has to do all the work? They're the one in the wrong!' we say. But forgiveness comes from God, and we can't force ourselves to forgive. Rather than wait until you feel in a forgiving mood, turn to the source of grace and second chances - God. He alone will give you the ability to forgive. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>There's quite a bit in the Bible comparing the Christian life to running a race and physical training. Maybe that doesn't motivate you - maybe the first things that come to mind are flashbacks of awkward PE lessons with ungainly arms, sore legs and the ultimate humiliation of finishing last!</p>
<p>Either way, there's an important point here: 'Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.' (1 Corinthians 9:24-27 NIV)</p>
<p>PE lessons aside, the motivation should be clear - if you're serious about Jesus, you need to be serious about disciplining yourself to pray and read His Word. That's the way you'll get the life He promises. The Bible says, 'If you refuse to learn, you are hurting yourself. If you accept correction, you will become wiser.' (Proverbs 15:32 GNT)</p>
<p>What discipline needs to be in place so you can run your race better? Deciding over and over to be a better person isn't hypocrisy. It's how we become mature. So, if you're struggling to spend time with God and pray every day, try getting up earlier, and make it a practice - like a muscle, it'll become easier the more you do it. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>If we're honest, we'll admit that we mostly like to stick at doing the things we're already good at. We cling to what comes naturally to us because it's what's known; we're comfortable with it and can ace it every time.</p>
<p>So here's a question: if that's how you're living, how much are you relying on God? By always sticking to what you know, are you actually downsizing your life from a royal palace to a tiny hut? </p>
<p>God had a mighty plan for Moses: he was to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. Moses never questioned God's ability to do this, but he did question his part in it all. In response to this plan, Moses blustered about and told God that public speaking wasn't his forté. God's reply was simple, but incredible. He said, 'Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.' (Exodus 4:12 NIV) </p>
<p>Then, while Moses allowed himself to be 100% fully reliant on God, spectacular things happened. Give God the space in your life, and He will build something amazing. If you pray He will help you to keep your expectations high - and show you the areas He wants you to take risks for Him. </p>

<p>We may need to wake up. There are members of our church family around the world who are being severely persecuted for believing in Jesus, and we must remember them in our prayers, just like we remember to include our family, friends and people who don't yet know Jesus. </p>
<p>In countries like North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, Christians are denied the right to practice their faith; secret police monitor worship gatherings and Christians are personally threatened with punishment, imprisonment and even death. Yet amazingly, the underground church continues to grow - fast. Paul, writing from prison himself, put it like this: 'Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured.' (Hebrews 13:3 NRS) Why not pray right now for all those suffering for the name of Jesus? Pray for their physical protection, endurance, and for God to speak through them. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I can die content...I have seen the Saviour.' Luke 2:29-30 TLB<br /><br /><p>It was a very different day. Simeon had been waiting for it a long, long time. He'd been at the Temple for years - watching, hoping. Perhaps he thought that he'd been mistaken. That he'd heard wrong. The heavenly promise he'd received was late, so late he was wondering if it was ever going to come. Probably not in his lifetime anyway. </p>
<p>Most people would have dismissed him as nice but a little bit quirky. Honestly, who could believe that one day an old bloke like Simeon would come face to face with God? That sort of thing didn't happen these days. Who did Simeon think he was - Abraham, the only man ever called 'Friend of God'? Or Moses, the man whose face glowed when he spent time in God's presence?</p>
<p>Yet Simeon's devotion paid off. All those early mornings, late nights and long days he'd spent in the temple looking for the face of God were worth it the moment he spotted a teenage girl holding her newborn baby. The Holy Spirit whispered to him that here was the answer to the promise. At long last, Simeon could go to his grave knowing he'd once nursed the Messiah in his arms. God's salvation was on its way -  and it was so close, he could cradle the Saviour to his chest. </p>
<p>Christmas Day is about God making His Son known to the likes of Simeon, and to the likes of you and me. Salvation is here. And you can touch it. You can hold it. You can be face to face with God - if you want it. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Well done, good and faithful servant...' Matthew 25:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>A young man vowed not to get married until he found the perfect lady. Finally, he found her. But then he discovered she'd vowed not to get married until she found the perfect young man. Last we heard, neither of them is married! </p>
<p>If you bury what God's given you, don't expect a 'well done' when you meet your Maker. Waiting until everything is arranged perfectly can rob us of stepping out and trying stuff. Maybe you know the parable of the talents; if not, you can read it in Matthew 25. The first two servants who invested what they'd been given got a 'well done' from the Master. But the last servant, who buried his talent... he got totally slammed. 'Sir, I know you are a hard man... I was afraid I would lose your money, so I hid it in the earth and here it is.' (Matthew 25:24 NLT) </p>
<p>This guy didn't have a balanced or true view of his master - he made him out to be a hard and harsh. The task seemed too hard, so he didn't bother. God is perfect and entirely holy, but He also understands you're not. God will meet you where you're at, and work with you from there. Don't let the fear of failure rob you of your future and what might be. If you're weighed down with fear or paralysed by a quest for perfection, ask a friend to pray with you: for freedom from those burdens.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>According to Psychology Today, more people say they have cheated on their marriage partners than on their income tax returns or expense accounts. Nearly half say that if they scratched another car in a car park they would drive off without leaving a note, even though 89 percent agree it would be wrong! Maybe our question shouldn't be, 'Why does God demand that we always tell the truth?' but, 'Why do we tolerate all these lies?' Jeremiah weighs in: 'The heart is deceitful above all things...' (Jeremiah 17:9 NIV) Much of the time, the bare truth makes us squirm. </p>
<p>At the age of three, when Mum asked, 'Did you hit your little brother?' we knew that honesty had its consequences. So we learned to think, 'Um, well, it's not really lying if I say...' We learned to cover things up. 'Did I hit my baby brother? That all depends on how you interpret the word hit. I mean, sure, I made contact with him, but would a jury consider it a hit? Everything is relative, you know.' We say, 'Did I hit my baby brother? Yes, Mum, I did. But it's not my fault. Had I been born with nonaggressive chromosomes and had you not permitted me to watch television, it would never have happened. So I can say I hit my brother, but the fault isn't mine. I'm just a victim of nurture and nature!' Yeah. Right! The Psalmist said, 'You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.' That's the truth about the truth.</p>
<p>'Half-truths' will drive a wedge between you and your family or friends. Maybe today's the time to fess up and sort it out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>It's all very well saying we should tell the truth all the time. But sometimes the truth isn't quite as impressive, or as shocking, as we'd like it to be. So we touch it up a little - just a little exaggeration here and there - to make the story a bit better. No one gets hurt, right?</p>
<p>Not so. In the book of Acts, Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of property and gave a portion of the money to the church. But they lied, claiming the land sold for the same amount of money as they gave (see chapter 5). That little white lie resulted in their deaths. 'Whew!' you say, 'I'm glad God doesn't strike people dead today for lying!' Well, maybe. Little white lies can bring slow death:</p>
<p>(1) In your friendships. Lies undermine trust between friends. Over time, the damage might go beyond repair. (2) In your conscience. Because a second lie is always easier to tell than the first. (3) In your usefulness to God. God says if you are honest in small things He will trust you with greater things (Matthew 25:21). </p>
<p>If you've dug yourself into the 'little white lie' sort of hole, there is a way out. Repent before God then go and make it right.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow Me, and I will make you...fishers of men.' Mark 1:17 NAS<br /><br /><p>Simon and his brother Andrew were happily getting on with the day-to-day fishing business. But Jesus had a different plan for their day: 'As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net...for they were fishermen. Come, follow Me, Jesus said, and I will make you fishers of men. At once they left their nets and followed Him.' (Mark 1:16-18 NIV)</p>
<p>Simon and Andrew left what they knew and what was comfortable to follow Jesus for a whole new life. Notice how these guys left their nets at once. There was no deliberation or conferring between them, no phone-a-friend or ask-the-audience. They just up and left their nets. They walked away from their trade, their security and their way of life. There was something about Jesus that they couldn't resist.</p>
<p>Jesus' mission was (and is) to restore an entire creation gone out of control by sin. It takes courage to join Him in a mission of such Biblical proportions; to care for the needy, to resist sin, to 'fish' for people to join in God's new life. Can you take a leaf out of Andrew and Simon's book and leave your (safety) nets behind? If you can, the mission comes with a warning: it will take you far out of what is comfortable to you.</p>
<p>Wherever God is calling you to - caring for the downtrodden and poor, evangelism, or a time to get closer to Him - have the courage to follow Him. He'll take you by the hand and lead you there.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Rise up; this matter is in your hands...take courage and do it.' Ezra 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ezra was a priest who took courage and took charge by leading the people of Judea and Jerusalem out of their sin before God. They'd broken God's commandments and as a people were full of guilt and shame. </p>
<p>Ezra didn't have a clue what to do at first, so he got vulnerable with God: 'While Ezra prayed...weeping and throwing himself to the ground in front of the Temple of God, a large crowd of people...gathered and wept bitterly with him.' (Ezra 10:1 NLT) We can take a lot from this reaction! Faced with a whirlpool of disobedience that he couldn't see a way out of, Ezra flung himself on the mercy of God in front of His people. </p>
<p>Sometimes when we make mistakes, our first reaction is that we don't want to go anywhere near God or church. We don't want to go before a holy God, in His holy house while we're dressed in dirty clothes and reeking of sin. Ezra got it right by flinging himself before the King of Kings. </p>
<p>He didn't stop there, though. Ezra then got up and took action against sin by instructing the people how to start living right. Have the courage to fling yourself on the mercy of God, then get on the offensive against sin by living out God's best for you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a greater power with us than with him.' 2 Chronicles 32:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>If the pathway to success were well lit it would already be crowded. All progress begins with one question: 'What needs to be done?' And somebody needs to be asking that question - why not you? The future belongs to those who have the courage to ask that question and the faith to hang in until they discover the answer. When the obstacles look too big and opposition seems too strong, stand on this Scripture: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged...for there is a greater power with us than with him.'</p>
<p>What are you seeing that needs to be done? Maybe your group of friends is stuck in a rut of bickering, simmering resentment or unforgiveness. It takes initiative to step in and get things sorted in a Christ-like way. Perhaps you see a gap in your school or workplace - an opportunity for evangelism, outreach, or peace-bringing. That empty space can be filled with your creative, God-honouring solution. It might not be comfortable. It might mean being unsettled. But take courage.</p>
<p>And take the opportunity to be creative. If there's a lack of something in your life, it may be that God has something more profound for you than the 'normal' solution could provide. Remember - there is a greater power with us than in the world! </p>
<p>If God reveals a need to you it usually means He's asking you to do something about it. So start with prayer and go from there! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Forgive whatever grievance you may have against one another...' Colossians 3:13 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>New Year, new start, right? Well, as the clock ticks over to midnight, why not leave all your 2012 hurts and grudges behind? Make 2013 a blank screen ready to write new history on, or an empty canvas to paint your masterpiece on. Do you get where we're going with this? New Year, new start!</p>
<p>Perhaps the festive season brought its fair share of family fighting and best-mate breakdowns... well, today's verse is telling us to loosen that grip on that grudge. Jesus-style forgiveness is on the menu.</p>
<p>Forgiveness doesn't come easy to us grudge-bearers. Philip Yancey says it's unnatural: 'You don't find dolphins forgiving sharks for eating their playmates. It's a dog-eat-dog world ... not a dog-forgive-dog world.' He's right - throwing sharp objects and posting threats on Facebook is what we naturally want to do. But why not do the 'supernatural' thing? Learn a lesson from Jesus, who forgave his killers while they were murdering him.</p>
<p>Lew Smedes famously said, 'To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.' Who is really benefiting from you holding on to that gripe? Your insides are all tied up in knots, your brain is running that argument on constant replay, and your tear ducts are ready for an extra shift at the meltdown factory. You're prisoner to your own grudge. But you hold the key to freedom.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... He will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Sometimes we can wonder if God notices or cares what we're doing for Him. There you are faithfully busting a gut to make youth group happen. Sweating prayers for your unconverted mates. Out of breath from constantly advancing God's Kingdom. And what is God doing? Seems He's got His divine eye on the some other person who's doing next to nothing for Him. The one who's blessed before she's even crawled out of bed. Everything's hunky-dory for her. And here you are without so much as an answered prayer to go on with.</p>
<p>Does it feel like you're merely an acquaintance He puts up with? Someone He humours when He can be bothered? Sometimes we carry this attitude around with us. Luke 14:13-14 NIV hints at why we don't always feel a pat on the back: 'When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.' God always cares when we actively do the right thing. It's just that sometimes the reward will be seen the other side of eternity. Take heart, no good deed gets overlooked by Him. So if you've been feeling overlooked, praise Him that it is just a feeling, and isn't truth. Then praise God that He loves your brother or sister who seems to get all the glory as much as He loves you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... He will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>You know the kind of parent who buys off their children with presents? The sort who're too busy to spend time with the kids, so they lob phones and iPods at them to ease their own guilt. While it's nice to receive the gifts, it doesn't say much for the relationship. It's the same with God. We can throw all our time and efforts into doing stuff for God, but if we're not stopping for quality time together our relationship is dying. The church at Ephesus got told off for this: 'I know your works, your labour, your patience... Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.' (Revelation 2:2-4 NKJ) God loves your all-out efforts for Him, but He does miss the sound of your voice. Don't be too busy to pray.</p>
<p>Jesus told us to love our enemies, do good and hope for nothing in return (Luke 6:35 NKJ) Don't do things for God in the hope of reward. He knows your motives and whether they are right or not, and He will repay you accordingly. Aim to please Him, not people. Doing something to please God is an act of worship. So, make sure your motives are clear. What's more important, being a God pleaser or being a people pleaser?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:3 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Let 'Worry' lord it over you and you'll get, free of charge: (1) Someone to talk things over with at 3 a.m. You'll never come to any solutions or anything useful because Worry just likes to stay up and chat. (2) A personal fitness coach. Worry loves to work that body. He'll try a few moves to increase your heart rate. He'll do some push-ups with your adrenalin. He'll leave you worn out soon enough (but not too tired for those late night chats.) (3) He'll let you see the world through new eyes. The smallest molehill can become Everest through the specs of Worry. And Everest never looked bigger than at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>OR... You can choose to let Jesus be Lord and receive this: (1) Sleep. Talk it over with Him in the evening and the night is yours. (2) Respite. When life is working you too hard, 'Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 4:6-7 NIV) (3) Clarity. Your Everest is Christ's sandcastle: easily kicked in.</p>
<p>So who's going to lord it over you?</p>
<p>When Worry comes knocking on your door try this: write down what's worrying you. Pray about it. Then scribble at the top of your list, '...the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard my heart and mind in Christ Jesus.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord...' 2 Peter 3:18 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>How often do you dodge prayer and reason that you can catch up with God sometime tomorrow? You know you'll have more time then. God wouldn't want you to miss your favourite TV show, would He? Or delay updating your Facebook status? Surely He knows it's unrealistic to expect that your only desire is to spend every waking second with your Lord and Saviour in intercessory prayer.</p>
<p>We can make excuses, but spiritual growth doesn't happen by osmosis. It doesn't just seep into us because we're Christians.</p>
<p>You don't fall in love with somebody by ignoring them. Perhaps you've never felt especially close to God because you've never spent time alone with Him. Why not start right now? The Psalmist wrote, 'My heart has heard You say, Come and talk with Me. And my heart responds, Lord, I am coming.' (Psalm 27:8 NLT) Start out by disciplining yourself to spend a little time with God each day and soon you'll find your whole being is craving more and more of Him. Steve Holmes writes that, 'Prayer is a gift God gives, not a duty God commands.' Time spent in prayer with God should reflect that fact. Prayer is a relationship, disciplined prayer is the act of putting appointments in your diary to make time for that relationship.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'In due season He will honour you with every blessing.' Psalm 37:34 TLB<br /><br /></p>
<p>You remember it vividly. One minute someone was praying for you, the next it was as if God Himself was next to you, topping your heart to the brim with dreams and ambitions. Everything in that moment made sense. The struggle to find out why you were put on this earth was over. It was all clear. God had a purpose for your life, tailor-made for you.</p>
<p>And then nothing. The feeling faded and everyday life kicked in. And here you are now wondering did God let you down or have you slipped up? What went wrong? Has God lost the blueprints? Why isn't He playing ball?</p>
<p>Truth is, God can't lie. And what has been promised will come to pass. It's just often there is a wait. And how you choose to wait is going to determine your happiness levels in the meantime. Waiting with frustration is not good for you. Frustration will lead to misery and mistakes and doubt. Waiting with anticipation is far healthier. Waiting on God will draw you closer to Him.</p>
<p>'Don't be impatient for the Lord to act! Keep travelling steadily along His pathway and in due season He will honour you with every blessing...' Psalm 37:24 TLB</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Do not throw away your confidence; it will be...rewarded.' Hebrews 10:35 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Expectant mothers want to keep their soon-to-arrive little bundle of joy wrapped up tight until it's time for a full-term delivery. The more premature the arrival, the more complications are possible. Waiting full term is the ideal for a pregnant mother - could it be the same with God's promises for you?</p>
<p>If God gave you everything He'd promised you now, would you be ready? Chances are there'd be premature complications. It could cause you more heartbreak than waiting for it to go full term. Paul paints the same picture: '...we eagerly look forward to this freedom. For if you already have something, you don't need to hope for it.' (Romans 8:24-25 NLT)</p>
<p>Waiting is part of life. Again, the Bible puts it best: 'Be patient, then...until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.' (James 5:7-8 NIV) Think back to some of the personal promises that God has given to you: Bible verses, pictures, words of encouragement... Remember them, and take time throughout your day to give Him thanks that His timing is right. As the old song says: 'Count your many blessings, count them one by one. And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I delight to do Your will, O my God.' Psalm 40:8 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>Imagine if the French had settled for an 'Eiffel Chimney'. Or Michelangelo had just painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel a nice blue. Or Alexander Graham Bell had decided to just write a letter. The world would be a lot less colourful, wouldn't it? These entrepreneurs didn't throw in the towel the moment the headaches started. They saw the potential, pictured the dream and persevered with the vision.</p>
<p>To keep your dream alive, you need to keep on dreaming. Don't let the waiting fester into frustration. Don't sell the dream short. Don't settle for a bargain bin sort of hope.</p>
<p>George Lucas had a vision to set new benchmarks for sci-fi movies. If the technology wasn't there, he'd invent it. When the impossible started knocking on the door, he and his colleagues would return to the vision: 'We were always dreaming of how it was going to be,' he said.</p>
<p>If he can keep believing in the name of Star Wars, surely you can keep believing in the name of Jesus. The Bible's number one dream-boy, Joseph, didn't let knockbacks steal his destiny. Disowned, trafficked, betrayed and left to rot in a dungeon... he still believed in his initial dream. Read Joseph's waiting game in Genesis 37-45. Take note of the obstacles Joseph overcomes in order to see his dreams turn to reality. Guess what? You might have to do some overcoming too before your dreams turn into reality.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'... endure hardship, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.' 2 Timothy 2:3 NKJ<br /><br /></p>
<p>From the moment you gave it up for Jesus you've been in a battle between your old nature and your new one. And it begins the moment you open your eyes each morning. So, will you hold up or fold today? If you know the enemy's strategy you can have a plan to deal with it. The attack is twofold and today we'll concentrate on the attack from <em>outside</em>. '... If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.' (James 4:4 NLT) That doesn't mean ditching all your unchurched friends, avoiding their activities and becoming holier-than-thou. It does mean being strong so that instead of you being negatively affected, you're a positive influence, like light in darkness. Susanna Wesley (mum of the two boys who founded the Methodist church) said these wise things: (1) 'Whatever dulls the sensitivities of my spirit toward God, or takes the fine edge off my thought of Him, must be ruled out for He is my Lord. (2) Whatever injures and weakens my body, or affects the mastery of it, must be ruled out for it is the temple of the Lord. (3) Whatever adversely affects the clearness of my witness to Jesus Christ before others must be ruled out for it was His parting wish that I should be a witness of Him. (4) Whatever may cause my brother to stumble in his Christian life must be ruled out for that would grieve Jesus.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV<br /><br />Ever find yourself acting as if you're the centre of the universe? It's scary how easily we can live as if 'it's all about me'. Even when we're serving God, our hearts can be pumping with the motivation of wanting to be noticed and admired.
<p>It's the heart behind what we do that's important to God. Paul says this: 'Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant.' (Philippians 2:5-7 NIV) In other words, serving God is about serving others rather than yourself.</p>
<p>What if you feel treated like a servant, bossed around and belittled? Jesus said: 'But I say, don't resist an evil person! If you are slapped on the right cheek, turn the other, too...' (Matthew 5:39 NLT) If you ask the Holy Spirit will reveal times when you have acted or thought like you were better than others. If there's a recurring issue in your life that is preventing you from putting others first, don't worry, that revelation is the first step to victory. The next is to pray.</p>
