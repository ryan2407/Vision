<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We should make plans - counting on God to direct us.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 16:9 TLB </span><br>Get the balance between faith and careful planning. You can't say, 'I'm gonna upgrade from my pay-as-you-go phone to the phattest, sleekest pay monthly on the market', if you ain't got the money. And none of that, 'The Lord will provide'. Is your network really going to send the bill to God? Give everything to God, yes, but not your sanity; you're given a brain for a reason. Walking by faith does not mean walking into oncoming traffic. Trust God to provide, but don't 'blow your budget'. Trust God for safety, but don't try to pull a wheelie round the M60! Trust God for your health, but don't chain smoke for England. Faith in God isn't a 'get out of jail' card; if you can't do the time, don't do the crime. 'Foolish dreamers live in a world of illusion; wise realists plant their feet on the ground' (Proverbs 14:18 TM).Wisdom says do all you can, then trust God to do what you cannot do. Faith and careful planning go hand-in-hand. Dream dreams but keep your feet firmly on the ground. If you want to be a worship leader start practicing your chords and scales. If you want to win the Olympics, put down that bag of Doritos and get out there training. God can do heaps if you've got the faith but He expects you to do your part as well.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Keep watch...you do not know...what day your Lord will come.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 24:42 NIV</span><br>If you've ever gushed and blushed over Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet falling big time in lurrrve in the film 'Titanic', you'll know it all ends tragically as the 'unsinkable' sinks. I bet you didn't know that it could all have so easily ended with Hollywood heroics. You see, not far from where The Titanic was sinking, the ocean liner Californian, was getting a ring side seat of the whole event. The crew hadn't realized The Titanic's flares were distress signals. The radio distress calls were within range - except for one small detail. The Californian's radio operator had dozed off. So on April 12, 1912, without knowing what he was seeing, the liner's second officer watched the real Titanic sink! 
Jesus said: 'People were eating...drinking, marrying...to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing...until the flood came and took them...That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man...keep watch...you do not know...what day your Lord will come' (Matthew 24:38-42 NIV). As a Church, we don't want to be like the Californian's radio operator, having forty winks whilst the world around us is desperately sinking. As individuals, we don't want to be like the people in Noah's day, getting all lairy when big, big change is about to happen. So be warned; keep your eyes peeled, better still, keep your lives peeled!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be sure to do what you should.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:4 NLT</span><br>Any actor will tell you one of the trickiest moments in performing is getting the first line out. Will it be loud enough? What if your voice breaks mid-sentence? What if your mind goes completely blank? Once the play's rocking, the doubts seem to take care of themselves. Sometimes our lives can be a bit like that; we get too wrapped up in the nagging doubts that we stop ourselves from starting. We worry about the things that might happen tomorrow, or next week or in ten years time. James knew this: 'Look here, you people who say, &quot;Tomorrow we are going to a certain town...We will do business there and make profit.&quot; How do you know what will happen tomorrow? For your life is like the morning fog - it's here a little while, then it's gone' (James 4:13,14 NLT). It might be that God eventually leads you to an Oscar for 'Alpha: The Musical'; it might be that God has plans for you smuggling Bibles into dangerous locations, but where have you been placed today? What's cooking on the menu now? The easier you can get to grips with rolling with what you've got now, the easier you'll get to grip with what God asks you to do in the future. So, wherever you're up to at the moment, work out your best use of time and get on with it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Make a careful exploration of...the work you have been given...then sink  yourself into that.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:4 TM</span><br>Successful people don't need a fuse lit under them. Their driving force comes from their God-given purpose within. They live for a cause greater than themselves. If you want a blueprint in 'how to make your life stand up and count', check out what Martin Luther King Jr did.
The United States had a terrible history of treating black people with no value and worth, unfairly forcing second class existences on millions of lives. Like an Old Testament prophet, Martin Luther King Jr took the initiative' becoming the voice of justice, the people's spokesperson, God's messenger. How did he do it? Not by fists, force or ferocity, but with the power of peace, the lesson of love and the grace of God.  Half a century later it's easy to lose sight of the opposition King and his followers faced: they were handcuffed and beaten up, clubbed with sticks, water cannoned, jolted by jailers' cattle prods, many, including King himself, eventually would lose their lives. 
These history makers recognised the time to stand up and be counted, they used their lives to live out God's justice on Earth as it is in Heaven. Jesus said, 'It's who you are and the way you live that count before God...' (John 4:23 TM). Learn from the civil rights heroes; live for a cause greater than yourself. Take up the baton and run.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not be afraid...The Lord...is going before you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 1:29-30 NIV</span><br>Two blooming well obvious things about initiative, and well you know it! 
1) Just do it. Do you suffer from the 'six weeks holidays' syndrome? Remember, when your Maths teacher set you homework to do over the holidays, and week one you stayed in bed 'til dinner, week two you played on the PS3, week four and five were a bit of a blur, week 6... well, its your last week, you may as well enjoy it whilst it lasts! In fact, you let it slide and slide, and now here you are Sunday night before you go back with unfinished homework. Is that you? Does that attitude follow you whatever you do in life? The best way to get rid of something you don't like doing is; to do it! Take the initiative. 
2) You've got to turn the engine on. People who take their driving test and give it their best shot may succeed, or fail. People who don't bother to turn the engine on, just fail. It ain't quantum physics this 'initiative' stuff; anyone who doesn't take initiative is guaranteed to fail! Solomon writes, 'If you wait for perfect conditions, you will never get anything done' (Ecclesiastes 11:4 TLB). It's better to be 80% sure, and start, than to wait until you're 100% sure, because by then the opportunity may have passed you by. Now, what are you waiting for?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Act with courage, and may the Lord be with those who do well.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CHRONICLES 19:11 NIV</span><br>So you thought Moses was the only one who crossed through waters without getting so much as a little toe wet, did you? Crack open your Bible to Joshua 3. One of the last obstacles between Israel and the Promised Land was the River Jordan. But God had a plan. He told the priests carrying the Ark that when they stepped in the river, the waters would roll back. Let's talk 'initiative' again: 
1) Nothing happens until you quit holding back! You can't wait for everything to be perfect. You can't wait until your butterflies go. You must take the initiative. Sometimes, it's only when we step out and move forward that things become clearer. Actually, many problems tend to take care of themselves once we have started to go with the flow 
2) You've got to keep at it. The Jordan River didn't dry up the moment the priests stepped into it. God dried it up 26 miles upstream, so they had to wait till all that water passed by (Joshua 3:14-17). Why did God do it that way? Because He sees the big picture. God planned an opening wide enough for not just one or two people, but for a whole nation (more than a million people) to cross. Is there an obstacle between you and your Promised Land? Trust God, quit holding back, and keep at it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Look at an ant.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 6:6 TM</span><br>Sometimes we can spend too much time twiddling our thumbs waiting for the nod from God to go to China or Africa. Listen: being a missionary is not a career choice, we're called to be alert to God's work wherever we've been placed at any particular time. There really is no time or place like the present for knuckling down and doing the things that pleases God. John Lennon once sang, 'Life is what happens whilst you're busy making other plans'. I wonder how many opportunities from God you've missed in the moment because you've been busy making other plans. Don't waste a lifetime waiting for your big break; be alert to today and take the initiative. Solomon writes: 'Look at an ant...Nobody has to tell it what to do. All summer it stores up food...So how long are you going to laze around doing nothing? How long before you get out of bed? A nap here, a nap there, a day off here, a day off there, sit back, take it easy - do you know what comes next?...a dirt-poor life, poverty your permanent houseguest' (Proverbs 6:6-11 TM). He meant: whatever we do (or neglect to do) catches up with us. God has a brilliant future mapped out for you, but you don't live in the future, you live in the now. So how about making a difference now? Go on; take the initiative.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Whoever loves money never has money enough.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 5:10 NIV</span><br>Sure everyone needs a bit of cash, but don't let it take over your life. Three things that money aint: 1) a best mate. A wad of money might buy you a bit of bling, but it won't be a shoulder to cry on when you're hurting, it won't have you in stitches over the phone, it won't have a kick about with you down the park. Money can buy people, it can't buy friends 2) a ticket to happiness.  So what would you spend your millions on anyway:a fast car; swimming pool for the house; pair of solid gold underpants? You'd soon become bored of your latest new gadget and toy. Jesus knows this, that's why He said, 'Life is not defined by what you have, even when you have a lot' (Luke 12:15, TM) 3) a comfort. Jesus told a story (Luke 12: 16-21) about a rich idiot who thought he had things sussed. He had so much stuff he didn't have enough room for it. Rather than being creative and kind with it, he decides to build bigger spaces to keep it all for himself. That same night he dies, so who ends up with it all? Not him that's for sure. The point is we end up with nowt when we fill up on ourselves rather than God. Bottom line: Aim to be loaded with God not cash.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Diotrephes, who loves to be first.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>3 JOHN 1:9 NIV</span><br>It's an old cliché, but you know when your PE teacher harps on about their being 'No &quot;I&quot; in team&quot;, well, they're right. Cristiano Ronaldo is thought to be pretty darn good at dribbling a ball, but if he was to face a whole team just by himself, he'd get nowhere. It doesn't matter how gifted he is, he still needs forwards to pass to, defenders to mop up mistakes, a keeper for a clean sheet - you get the picture. It's the same with us. Our gifts and strengths fit in with other people's gifts and strengths. The last thing you want in a team is a Prima Donna who refuses to work with others. The early church knew all about that: 'But Diotrephes, who loves to be the leader, refuses to have anything to do with us...Not only does he refuse to welcome the travelling teachers, he also tells others not to help them. And when they do help, he puts them out of the church' (3 John 1: 9-10 NLT). What a muppet Diotrephes was! He wasn't into team play, he was a diva. He wanted centre stage for himself. But 'stars' are insecure; they can't get beyond themselves to work with others. They stay weak in certain areas. Don't be a Diotrephes diva, use your talent as part of a team. Get connected. You'll go further with your church than without.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Lord tested Joseph's character.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 105:19 NLT</span><br>If we can learn anything from Joseph it's that there's no gain without pain. Joseph is a textbook example of putting up with the pain and hanging in there with God. The story begins with a classic case of Golden Child syndrome. Jacob had many sons, but only Golden Child Joseph is given the now world-famous Technicolor Dreamcoat. This, understandably, miffed his brothers good and proper. Later, when he reports an arrogant dream he has had about them, things get rough for the golden one. His brothers leave him for dead, he's sold to people traffickers, then gets banged up in prison for a crime he didn't even commit, and he's pretty much left there, as everyone forgets all about him.  A horrific chain of events sparked off all because he was a bit big headed and stupid as a teenager. Yet he hung in there, and that should give us all hope. Joseph's character was being tested (all the big headedness being booted out of him along the way), with plenty of occasions for him to get the hump with God, but as he keeps on in there his character gets refined. The story ends with all of Joseph's earlier dreams coming true, but that doesn't seem to be the point. The point seems to be that God wants more than to just do stuff through you, he wants to do it in you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>For we are...created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:10 NIV</span><br>Any Strictly Come Dancing fans out there? Yes? Well, then you'll know the importance of keeping in step, not missing the beat, and moving in rhythm. Acts 17:28 says something similar; 'In him, we live, and move, and have our being'. The Holy Spirit is like our dance partner in life, laying down the beat, setting the rhythms, and moving us with grace. Once you start moving your feet in time to the Spirit, nothing is going to matter as much as keeping in step. When the Spirit moves, we move. When the Spirit pauses, we pause. When The Spirit acts, we act. The Bible puts it like this: 'live a life worthy of the calling you have received' (Ephesians 4:1 NIV), meaning: 'don't drag your feet, don't try and do it yourself, walk in step with God'. Any dancers off doing their own thing on 'strictly' are sure to be booted off the show; good movement is about being in tune with each other.  Don't go it alone, only God can direct you in the best way for your life. Listen to His timing, its perfect for how you will move. In the film, Billy Elliot, Billy's dad wants him to be a boxer like him and his dad before him. But Billy knows he's cut out for ballet not boxing. Likewise, only you know (through The Holy Spirit) what God's cut you out for.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He persevered because he saw Him who is invisible.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:27 </span><br>Is God into nutters or what? 1 Kings tells the tale of a widow who lived during a famine, with only enough food to scrape together for one last meal. Yet she was nutty enough to share it with the prophet Elijah. Even though most of her must have been thinking 'I've not even enough for myself', her spiritual sat-nav whispered 'Give what you've got, God will give you back what you need'. She was right, God provided for her throughout the famine. And what about Mr. Nutty himself: Noah. He was the fruitloop who started to build the world's biggest boat bang in the middle of a desert, miles and miles from water, all because his spiritual sat-nav hinted at it.
History is full of nutters, and it seems there's a fine line between nutty and genius: The Wright brothers were crazy enough to believe they could fly like birds, and set the blueprint for the modern aeroplane. Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity ; a genius then? Not when you find out how he did it; by flying a kite in a thunder storm (don't try this at home folks)! All these people trusted their instincts and acted on them. So yes, its official, God loves a nutter, or at least blesses them for their crazy ideas. What might God be showing you that others haven't seen? Check your spiritual sat-nav.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Abraham Saw the Place afar off.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 22:4 </span><br>Girls, you'll understand this - you know when you go shopping for that certain, special something, that 'je ne sais quoi'....you're not quite sure what it is yet, but you'll just KNOW it when you see it! You'll just trust in your retail radar to carry you there. Well, that's what it's like with God sometimes. Listen: 'We have an unction [insight] from God and we know things' (1John 2:20 paraphrase). It's like God gives us spiritual sat-nav. Abraham had it when God sent him to a place he'd never even seen (read Genesis 22). But he still found it: 'On the third day Abraham...saw the place...' (Genesis 22:4). Sorted! There's nothing like the moment you see what you've been looking for and your spiritual sat-nav shouts, 'You have reached your destination!' When there's no way through ahead, sat-nav tells you before you get there.   Have you ever noticed people who see things that are just not there. We call these people one of two things, a prize loon or a visionary (sometimes a bit of both) Visionaries usually end up doing the impossible. Why? Because they've learned to follow their spiritual sat-nav! Jesus followed His every day, through the garden of Gethsemane, all the way to the cross, into the grave and back out again! If He hadn't been tuned in the consequences are unimaginably bad. Thank God He's given you a spiritual sat-nav, learn to use it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 66:13 NIV</span><br>Anna Jarvis was impressed with her mum. So impressed that after she passed away in May 1905 Anna began a campaign to get her accomplishments recognised. One thing led to another and within 3 years Anna and a group of friends had organised the world's first ever Mother's Day service. They thought it would be a pretty popular idea so they booked the biggest venue in town - it held 5000 people - but 15,000 showed up! That was exactly 100 years ago and as we now know the idea really did catch on. 
Pastor Chuck Swindoll thinks mums are impressive too: 'As significant as political, military, educational, or religious figures may be, none compare to the impact made by mothers. Their words are never fully forgotten, their touch leaves an indelible impression...the memory of their presence lasts a lifetime. I ask you, who else has that kind of influence?'  He's right, nobody has the unique ability to shape a life more than a mum. Think about all the little ways over the years of your life that you've been shaped by that loving influence. Sometimes loving from close by, sometimes loving from a distance. At that first Mother's Day service Anna Jarvis showed she had a special window into a mother's heart saying, 'A mother's love is new every day.' So how are you going to show your appreciation for that love today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:20 NIV</span><br>Some dreams get you into trouble; like when you're caught daydreaming of Shayne Ward out of the Geography room window. Others are plain unrealistic; like when you dream that Pizza Hut have taken over catering in the school canteen. Then some seem plain 100% impossible; yet maybe God has placed this kind of dream in your head or heart for a reason. Strangely enough, it can be the ones that tamper with logic, that defy gravity, that scream 'CAN'T BE DONE!' that God wants you to chase. 
What's bugging you at the moment? What's waking you up at 3am every night with its bright wild idea? What tugs at your heart strings and plays a symphony of goose bumps on the back of your neck? Could it be a prompting from the Holy Spirit?
Test it and see, ask God about it, share it with your youth group leader, do some research.  
Are you dreaming about mission work abroad? Find out about the country, what good organizations already work there. Are you thinking about University? Work at it, even if it seems impossible at the moment. Whether its taking up cross stitching, learning the guitar or bungee jumping from the moon (perhaps not such a good one), check it out before it dies out. When God gives you a dream, He leads you to the resources to help you. Ask God. Keep the dream alive!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>That I may...become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILLIPPIANS  3:10 AMP</span><br>How annoying are couples in lurrrve? They have one topic of conversation: each other. Yuk - their secret whisperings and in-jokes, their long dreamy stares into each others eyes, how they can finish each others sentences off because they know exactly what the other is thinking; somebody pass the bucket, please! Actually, you'd have to know somebody intimately well to do those kind of things. Imagine knowing God that intimately. That's what Paul wanted: '[For my determined purpose is] that I may know Him [that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him, perceiving and recognising and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly and more clearly]' (Philippians 3:10 AMP). What about you? Where's your relationship at? Imagine if your girl only ever phoned you when she needed your help out of a tricky situation, or if your boyfriend never said hello because he was always too busy; how shallow would that be? We'd never dream of treating our better half like that, yet sometimes that's how we can treat God. 
So here follows three quick lurrrve lessons to boost your relationship with God: 1) spend loads of time together. Chat, laugh and listen 2) share what's on your heart. Future, past and present 3)  take the bad days with the good. Work at it, persevere. Get to know God intimately.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Lord said...&quot;What is that in your hand?&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 4:2 NIV</span><br>If you've ever thought 'I wish I had what they've got', you've failed to grasp what you already do have. It's like once, when God asked Moses what was in his hand (Exodus 4:2), all Moses saw was the same old, scabby, walking stick he'd carried around for years. But, that same old, scabby, walking stick became the rod used to dry up a path through the Red sea!  God can take something you've had all your life (which you've always thought of as scabby and old) and use it to do 'out-there things. All you have to do is have the faith to believe God can do it. There's nothing like a bit of faith.
It takes faith to move home to a country you've never even seen; but Abraham did it. It takes faith to believe that by marching around like loonies in Jericho, walls would come tumbling down but Joshua did it. It takes faith to believe a stone in a sling shot could turn your nation into a mighty world power; but David did it. Faith is that crazy, out-there idea in your head, that believes this is not just a scabby, old walking stick, this is not just a slingshot and stone, this is in my hand for a reason. What is in your hand? Give it to God, see what happens?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In every thing give thanks.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSOLONIANS 5:18</span><br>What kind of a future would a murderer, known as public enemy number one, on the run, living in the back end of nowhere, have? Apparently a God filled one, as this pretty much sums up 40 years of Moses' life, and if God can use Moses, despite his well dodgy past, God can certainly use you. You see, sometimes with the past it's best just to get over it. Don't let your history haunt you; get over it! Don't let your hurts rent too much brain space; get over it! Don't take a round the world guilt trip; get over it! Paul writes, 'In every thing give thanks.' In everything? Surely not. Are we to give thanks when a close mate has stitched us up? Are we to be thankful when we're feeling desperately lonely? What about when the bottom has fallen out of our lives; do we say a big, cheesy 'Thanks' then too? Actually, something bizarre happens when we focus on the thanks despite how we're feeling. God meets us, and circumstances may not change, but our hearts do. God loves an attitude of faith. The Bible is full of stories of broken people in nasty situations who come out the other end of it doing pretty amazing things. Don't let situations give you a headache, let them get you closer to God. Give thanks, get God, and get out of the past.

We all know the rest, David triumphed and later became king, but I bet you didn't know the knock on effect he had, check this out: '... then Sibbecai... killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued. And there was war with the Philistines again and Elhanan... killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot; and he also was descended from the giants. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him. These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants' (1 Chronicles 20:4-8 NAS). Now that's a firm you wouldn't mess with! You see, Saul had never touched a giant, so neither had his army. But David was fearless, so his crew was fearless. Why? Because confidence is catching.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not throw away your confidence.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 10:35 </span><br>Three ways to boost your confidence: 
1) Don't put your faith in your threads. It's good to have image; it's essential to know you're made in God's image. You may feel useless but in reality you're priceless. Even if nobody else had ever been born, Jesus would still have died just for you. Why? Because you're worth it!  
2) Bag yourself a good mate, bin yourself a bad vibe. Bad vibes bring you down saying things like 'you'll never do it', 'you're too young', 'you're too stupid', 'you're not good enough'. A good mate is like gold dust. A good mate believes in you despite the odds, building you up, ever ready to share the struggle - bag yourself a good 'un. 
3) Quit comparing yourself with others. So you can't shake your booty like Beyonce or scissor kick like Rooney. Remember God's given you stuff that they could never do. There'll only ever be one you. Only you can achieve what God has planned for you to do since before the beginning of time. Maybe you don't believe in you, but God does and always has. You come fully endorsed by the creator of the universe. 'God doesn't want you to be shy with his gifts, but bold and loving and sensible' (2 Timothy 1:7 The Message) What more reason do you want?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not throw away your confidence.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 10:35 </span><br>Why do we think celebs are so special? Who gave them a double dose of confidence? Who put the kick ass in their attitude? Unlike us mere mortals, were they just born to do it? Actually, it's because they've got expensive PR people working behind the scenes, making them look good. Now, you probably don't earn enough pocket money to hire your own ace PR department, but don't worry, God is well up for the job. God's always working behind the scenes. Check this out:  '... I have learned [during a lifetime of walking with God] the secret of being happy at any time in everything that happens, when I have enough to eat and when I go hungry, when I have more than I need and when I do not have enough. I can do all things through Christ, because He gives me strength' (Philippians 4:12-13 NCV). Paul didn't need some high flying PR guru working behind the scenes, he had Jesus working through him! Knowing that gave him the ability to handle everything that came his way. Confidence is taking your present situation; whatever's in your face, whatever's limiting your life, messing with your head or screwing up your dreams; and then facing the fear and giving it to God. If you think you can't cope, remind yourself who can by reading Philippians 4:12 -13 again.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God determined...the way to bring out his best in us.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 2:7 TM</span><br>Bobby Jones was winning golf tournaments by age 12. But he had a temper. His nickname was club-thrower. An older bloke called Grandpa Bart recognized Jones' talent and his character issues. He said. 'Bobby, you're good enough to win, but you'll never win big until you control that temper of yours.' Jones did master his temper, and went on to win his first Open Championship at 21. Grandpa Bart said, 'Bobby was 14 when he mastered golf, but he was 21 when he mastered himself.' One of the key ways to overcome your issues and grow that much-needed character is to have a clear sense of purpose. So, where do you find your life's purpose? By turning to what God has revealed about life in His Word. By reading about God working in the lives of all those Bible people we find amazing insights into how life works, we see what to avoid, and get clues about what to expect in the future. The Bible says, 'God's wisdom...goes deep into the interior of his purposes...It's not the latest message, but more like the oldest - what God determined as the way to bring out his best in us.' (1 Cor 2:7 TM) His best. That's what God is focused on for you. He sees you from the inside out and wants to help you get into tip top condition.  It's true; God wants you to be buff!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The integrity of the upright guides them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 11:3 NIV</span><br>A writer called Margaret Mead once stated, 'What people say, what people do, and what people say they do, are entirely different things.'  She's talking about the need to have integrity and integrity is an essential part of being buff on the inside. The word integrity simply means 'to integrate, to become one with.' It requires having your values, thoughts, and actions all lined up not zig-zagging all over the place. 
Some people just want to make a 'good impression' but impressions are like shadows; they disappear when a strong enough light is shone on them. Integrity is the genuine article - the more you shine the light on it, the more detail you can see. 
People of integrity always stand out. Author Pat Williams tells of Gandhi's trip to England to speak before Parliament. The Government had opposed India's independence and as a result Gandhi had often been threatened, arrested and jailed. Gandhi spoke passionately for two hours, after which the packed hall gave him a standing ovation. Afterwards, a reporter asked Gandhi's assistant how he'd been able to deliver such a speech without notes. 'You don't understand Gandhi,' he responded. 'What he thinks is what he feels. What he feels is what he says. What he says is what he does. What Gandhi feels, thinks, says and does, are all the same. So he doesn't need notes.' Now, that's integrity!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[It is] better to have self-control than to conquer a city.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 16:32 NLT</span><br>You've seen 'em on the TV, stretching their superbly toned legs on the edge of the track. They're the world's top athletes and every single one of them is buff! You don't get to that level in a sport if you're carrying a pie-belly around with you. But just like getting buff on the outside means the right diet and lots of training - so does getting buff on the inside - building a strong character. An old Greek bloke called Plato said, 'The first and best victory is to conquer self,' and he was bang on. 
If you're serious about building strong character, set high standards for yourself and refuse to lower them. Need a role model? You won't find a better one than Jesus. He said, 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself' (Matthew 16:24 NIV). Every day look for an opportunity to say 'no' to yourself in some small area. Try it; it'll be hard but the payoff will come when you need to say no to yourself in some big area of life. Like saving for a rainy day, you'll have strength to draw on when you need it. Over 100 years ago Henry Parry Liddon observed, 'What we do on some great occasion will probably depend on what we already are; and what we are will be the result of previous years of self-discipline'; and that statement's as fresh today as it was then.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do not let sin control the way you live.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 6:12-13 NLT</span><br>Self-control is listed in the Bible as proof God's Spirit lives in us (Galatians 5:22-23). Without it your life is like a car without any brakes - it may be exciting for a while, but eventually you'll end up in a mangled mess! It's impossible to live a lifestyle of purity unless you're ruthless with those basic flesh-impulses. The Bible says, 'All your lives you've let sin tell you what to do. But thank God you've started listening to a new master, one whose commands set you free to live openly in his freedom!' (Romans 6:18 TM). Every day your body will send you messages that are likely to lead you off in all sorts of random directions. It's not that your body is evil, it's just that your mind is wired to respond to the signals it gets from the surrounding world; a world that's pretty messed up. One Bible boffin writes: 'Life on earth is really nothing more than a string of moments, one after another. And I do not want my testimony for Jesus Christ to be shattered by a single moment of indulging my flesh. I don't want one moment of rage or pride or lust to cast a shadow over a lifetime of walking with my Lord. Frankly, I fear that possibility. And do you know what? I want to fear that possibility. When I stop fearing it, I'm in grave danger.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are those who persevere.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:12 TNIV</span><br>On June 1, 1965, a 13-foot boat slipped quietly out of Falmouth, USA. Its destination? Falmouth, England. It would be the smallest craft ever to make the trans-Atlantic voyage. The sailor, Robert Manry, had been working for a local newspaper but felt 10 years at a desk was enough boredom for anyone. He was afraid, not of the ocean but of all the people who would try to talk him out of the trip. So he only shared it with some relatives and his wife. Out at sea He endured many sleepless nights trying to cross shipping lanes without getting run over by huge tankers. He had no radio and the loneliness led to hallucinations. His rudder broke three times. Storms swept him overboard. Finally, after 78 days alone at sea he sailed into Falmouth, England. Alone on the boat he'd dreamed about what he'd do once back on land. He expected to just check into a hotel, eat dinner, then maybe find out if a journalist might be interested in his story. Then came the surprise! While he was at sea word had spread. To his amazement nearly 50,000 people stood cheering him to the shore! 
One of the Bible's great themes is perseverance - it's what Robert Manry had. No matter how great your calling, your talent or your cause without perseverance you won't make it. 'Blessed are those who persevere.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Though you have built stone mansions, you will not live in them.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>AMOS 5:11 NIV</span><br>You don't have to look far in the Bible to find mention of money. You won't find any Pounds, Euros or Dollars but the stories about both generosity and corruption weave in and out of the pages on a pretty regular basis. The message is loud and clear - God's bothered about what you do with what's in your wallet and He's also bothered about how it gets there. For example, in one bit of the Bible we hear God giving wealthy people a right rollocking for making themselves richer by making other people poorer (Amos 5:11-12) Sadly, by the time the church had been set up nearly a thousand years later it was still going on (James 5). Even sadder still, it's happening in our world today. In fact it's worse than ever. When you're choosing a career path for your life the temptation is there to go for the kind of job that will earn you the most money without asking too many questions about how that money is made. 'Well, when I'm making a big fat wad I'll be able to give loads to the church!' Does God really want dirty money? 
You might not have much cash right now because you might not have much 'earning power' right now, you need to get some qualifications and experience; but even so, make it your goal today to make God happy by earning a living the right way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 132:13 NIV</span><br>Before David became King in Zion (Jerusalem), he had to live in three other places. Each place was a training ground:
1) At home in Bethlehem. David learned responsibility, to earn a living, to support his family, to develop his relationship with God, and to overcome the resentment of others because of God's favour on his life. At home you prepare to handle bigger tasks by being faithful in smaller ones. It's here that your character is developed and your trust is proven.
2) In the cave of Adullam. Living with the misfits and rejects of society David learned to give to other people without expecting anything in return; loving and serving even when his own life was under attack. Your Adullam is where God deals with your selfish motives. Sadly, some of us never make it out of this cave.
3) The Fortress of Hebron. The word Hebron means covenant or promise. It was one of the highest mountains in Israel and there was no easy road to the fortress city at the top; it was uphill all the way. And that's the thing about God's promises, they don't just come about accidentally, you have to push forward with determination to enter into them. 
So where has your journey taken you so far? Which place are you in at the moment? How close are you to Zion?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed is the man who finds wisdom.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:13 NIV</span><br>It's estimated that only one-third of all adults read an entire book after they leave school. Why? Because these people view education as a stage of life, not a way of life. Derr! Every stage of life presents lessons to be learned. Everybody has the choice either to be teachable and continue to learn, or to be closed-minded and stop growing. The Roman statesman Cato is an example of someone who made the right choice. He started to study Greek when he was 80! When asked why he was tackling such a hard task at his age he replied, 'It's the earliest age I have left.' Unlike Cato, too many of us see learning as an event instead of a process.
Another reason that staying teachable is really important is because the things that make you may not be the things that keep you. You have to remain open to new ideas and new revelation. Locked in a Roman dungeon and facing execution, Paul wrote to Timothy and asked him to bring his stash of books (2 Timothy 4:13). It's like he's saying, 'They've locked up my body but my mind's still active - I still have so much more to learn' (2 Timothy 4:13). If Paul, not knowing if he was ever going to see the light of the sun again, was keen to keep on learning what kind of example does that give to us?!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The discerning heart seeks knowledge.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 15:14 NIV</span><br>Besides being possibly the world's most amazing painter and sculptor, Leonardo da Vinci was a genius in every aspect of science too! His notebooks still exist and show how 500 years ago he was dreaming up submarines, helicopters and all sorts of other gadgets. In one notebook he wrote, 'Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigour of the mind.' He was driven by his desire to create and kept on learning and developing ideas until the very end of his life. The good news is, even if you don't have talent like Leonardo you can still go a long way if you have a Leonardo attitude. What was that attitude; Leonardo was 'teachable'. 
Teachability is the hunger to discover and grow. It's the willingness to learn, unlearn, and relearn. If you're talented, you may have trouble when it comes to being teachable. Gifted people sometimes act like they know it all and that makes it hard for them to keep developing. So remember, the most important skill to get is learning how to learn. Try this for the next week; ask people for their advice and deliberately keep your mouth shut when you feel tempted to chip in your own 'expert' opinion. Write down what you learn when you start being teachable by others. You'll be amazed!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The LORD was grieved... and his heart was filled with pain.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Gen 6.6</span><br>Today's the day when a few people will feel very special and a lot of people will feel pretty miserable. One or two people will actually go as far as to send themselves a card so that when it arrives through the letter box everybody else thinks they've got a secret admirer! One way or another, Valentine's Day is an emotional day for everyone. 
Emotions are weird aren't they? Some people always have their emotions hanging out like washing on a line. Other people hide them away where nobody can see. 
One thing's for sure, God made us with emotions. The Bible's full of them! Your mind might jump to Psalms as the 'emotional' bit of the Bible, but feelings run right through it, and not just human feelings. Early on in the story of God and His creation we get the sense that when God made us 'in His image' (Genesis 1:26-27) it involved blessing us with His ability to 'feel'. That sets us apart from all the rest of creation. Yes, your dog might pull a sad face and whimper when you leave the house in the morning but Rover can't understand how it feels to get a Valentine's card, or not! Happiness, sadness, pleasure and anger are all 'gifts' from God, who feels all these things too. But most of all He has given us love, a better love than any human can give.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Run from temptations.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 2:22 CEV</span><br>The ancient Greeks loved hero-stories. One of the most famous involves mysterious creatures called Sirens who lived by the sea. The Sirens sang songs so beautiful that passing sailors who heard it were hypnotized and jumped overboard to their death. The hero Odysseus ordered himself to be tied to the mast and the crew's ears filled with wax to block the music; that way they sailed past in safety. Clever guy that Odysseus! 
Maturity is about being aware of your danger zones and coming up with ways to avoid that danger. Paul said, 'If you think you are strong...be careful not to fall' (1 Corinthians 10:12 NCV). He told Timothy, 'Run from temptations that capture young people...do the right thing.' That's what Joseph did. When his boss's wife tried to get off with him he didn't a) get super-spiritual and try to convert her b) think, 'I'm young, lonely, far from home, and her husband's out of town; maybe just this once' c) hang around to see how strong his will-power was. No, he legged it saying, 'How...could I do such a wicked thing...against God?' (Genesis 39:9 NIV).
The bottom line is this: when you're weak in certain areas you need to steer clear of anything that feeds into them. The Psalmist said, 'You are my safe refuge...where my enemies cannot reach me' (Psalm 61:3 NLT). So, what do you need to avoid?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Friend, do what you came for.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 26:50 NIV</span><br>There's no pain like being stabbed in the back by a friend. But the truth is, God allows certain people into our lives to bring about His plans - even people like Judas, a person Jesus called 'friend'. Before Jesus was betrayed He told the disciples, 'I am not saying these things to all of you... this fulfils the Scripture that says, &quot;The one who eats my food has turned against me&quot;' (John 13:18 CEV). In a bizarre twist of destiny Judas' betrayal kick-started the sequence of events that led Jesus to the cross. You can't always avoid getting hurt. When some doors swing open all you see inside is darkness. Only when you get inside that darkness do you realise that the light you've been given is on the inside. 
Jesus isn't the only one who suffered like this. David poured out his heart: 'My best friend, the one I trusted...has turned against me' (Psalm 41:9 NLT). At times like this you need to know that God will never allow His plans for you to be wrecked by somebody else's actions. He may allow your Judas to go so far, but no further. And in the end, God loves to turn negatives into positives. None of us enjoys pain, but enduring it takes us to places that, taking the bright and easy path, we'd never reach.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Everything got started in Him and finds its purpose in Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:16 </span><br>Today's technology is designed to be more and more 'intelligent', but what if a DVD player could really think? Would it get upset, 'I really want to make toast today?' BONKERS! Design determines destiny. The one who made you also knows what you will be best at. 'So, how can I discover His destiny for me?' you wonder. Listen: 'It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. Long before we first heard of Christ [He] had designs on us for glorious living, part of the overall purpose He is working out in everything and everyone' (Ephesians 1:11 TM). Notice three things here: 1) You only discover your life's destiny through a relationship with Christ 2) God determined your life's destiny before you existed; without your input! 3) Your destiny fits into a much larger destiny. Not too many years ago, a Russian novelist, called Andrei Bitov, was growing up under the heavy communist regime, but God got his attention. He recalls, 'One dreary day while riding the Metro in St. Petersburg, I was overcome with a despair so great that life seemed to stop at once, pre-empting the future entirely, let alone any meaning. Suddenly, all by itself, a phrase appeared: without God life makes no sense. Repeating it in astonishment, I rode the phrase up like a moving staircase, got out of the Metro and walked into God's light.' Are you settling for making toast when you're really a DVD player? Pray today that God, your master designer, would give you a glimpse of your destiny. 'Everything got started in Him and finds it's purpose in Him.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you have many kinds of troubles, you should be full of joy.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:2 NCV</span><br>OK, let's get something straight - there's a big difference between a) having 'many kinds of troubles' and b) getting into lots of trouble. You can't avoid the first category but you can avoid the second! God can, and will, use our mistakes to teach us, but enough trouble will come your way just from 'life'; don't go out looking for more! 
James describes 'many kinds of troubles' because usually it's not one big thing but a lot of little things. We have to deal with health trouble, money trouble, relationship trouble or emotional trouble, it all gets us stressed out. Peter helps to put it all in perspective for us though, saying: 'when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honour on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world (1Peter 1:7 NLT). There's nowhere we can go to escape the trial of our faith. Trying to avoid it is like changing your school so that you might not have to do that exam you're dreading. Well the next school will have exams too, probably harder than the ones in the school you just left, and by switching all you've actually done is get further behind in your studies and preparation. The Word 4U 2day is you can't outrun troubles and trials, but God is with you and He will strengthen you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We see it taking shape day after day-a holy temple built by God, all of us built into it, a temple in which God is quite at home.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:22 TM</span><br>Yesterday we saw that there are times when we need to get one to one with God. But that's not the end of the subject. Like many truths in the Bible this is a coin with two sides. There are other times when we can only experience the fullness of God's presence as we get together with God's people. The place where this happens is Church. When people who all love Jesus gather together to worship, to praise and to share words of encouragement God's Spirit shows up in a powerful way. We grow together and move forward as we stir each other up with His Word. 
The world around us can be messy and confusing, stuff happens that leaves us feeling ragged and raw. We struggle and stumble and sometimes feel like losers, but when we gather with the big family called the Church we're reminded that we're on the winning side. Let's get real; it's hard to celebrate all by yourself! When you have something worth celebrating you text everybody an invite to the party so you can share the joy. Well Jesus is so excited about His awesome victory at the cross that He invites us every week (and even more often if we're up for it) to celebrate what He achieved for us. And celebration is a group activity.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I sat alone because your hand was on me.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 15:17 NIV</span><br>Having your mates around you is a great feeling - but being alone can be even better - when you're alone with God! In fact there are times when it's absolutely essential to make space for just you and God. The life of Jesus shows that over and over again: 1) 'Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed' (Luke 5:16 NIV) 2) 'Jesus... withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place' (Matthew 14:13 NIV) 3) 'he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.' (Matthew 14:23 NIV); God loves to clarify His plans for your life when there's nobody else around. That's because He wants you to be more influenced by Him, than them! 
When God's getting you ready for the next phase of growth He'll beckon you aside, away from the company of others. The great prophets of old new this. Elijah spent the night alone in a cave learning about the true power of God (1 Kings 19). Daniel 'was left alone, gazing at this great vision' (Daniel 10:8 NIV), and Jeremiah wrote: 'I sat alone because your hand was on me.' Learn to understand the difference between being lonely and being alone. When God calls you to spend time away from your mates don't treat it like a detention; it's a special honour! Learn all you can so that you're ready to be a world-changer.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Forgetting those things which are behind.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILLIPPIANS 3:13</span><br>It's impossible to reach your God-given destiny without overcoming your past. If you need inspiration to overcome your life's obstacles, look straight to Jesus. His national identity labelled him as part of a hated minority, people who faced prejudice every day. The stubborn religious leaders refused to listen to his message of love, instead they hounded him as a heretic. One of His closest friends betrayed Him to make himself wads of cash. Ultimately He was classified as 'too dangerous to live' and so was sentenced without a fair trial and died like the worst criminal. And what does He say about His suffering, and ours? 'But cheer up! I have defeated the world' (John 16:33 CEV). 
It seems like the only kind of party some people enjoy being at is a pity-party. And there's only ever one person on the invite list; yourself! Listen, don't waste your time and energy replaying things in the past that can't be changed. The past is over so get over it. That might sound a bit harsh but maybe today's the day you need to hear it. Make today the day you look forward. Get up and get on! God says, 'The plans I have for you...are...good' (Jeremiah 29:11 NLT). That means the best is yet to come!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let us worship God in a way that will please Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:28 </span><br>In John, Chapter 4, a woman with a chequered past, tried to argue with Jesus as to the best time, place, and style for worship. But Jesus made it clear to her that these issues were irrelevant. Where you worship God isn't as important as why you worship God. What you get out of it isn't as important as what you put into it. Listen: 'His worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth' (John 4:24). Worship is your spirit responding to God's spirit, 'Deep calls to deep' (Psalm 42:7). Praise that isn't from deep down isn't really praise at all. You can have a lot of fun when you worship, which doesn't mean you don't take worship seriously. The best style of worship for you is the one that is authentic and enables you to express your love for God without denying your culture and personality. If God intentionally made us all different why would we all be expected to express our love for Him in the same way? There's no one-size-fits-all. You don't glorify God by trying to be something He doesn't need one more of. God wants you to be yourself! The Message Bible really explains this well: 'That's the kind of people the father is out looking for: those who are simply and honestly themselves before Him in their worship' (John 4:23 TM). If your worship is mindless, it's meaningless. Jesus called thoughtless worship, 'babbling' (Matthew 6:7). So watch out for biblical lingo, coz it can easily become tired from overuse. Be creative with your worship words. Expand your praise dictionary. Better to receive 2 specific compliments than 20 vague generalities. Dig deep and give God some creative praise today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I will protect those who trust in my name.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 91:14 NLT</span><br>Not long ago Volkswagen ran a TV advert that showed a city full of people going about their lives. Sitting on top of all the cars, and walking alongside all the pedestrians there are angels busily doing their job of looking after people, cleverly preventing them from having accidents. However, one angel looks bored, he's wandering around aimlessly getting funny looks from the other angels. Only at the end of the advert do we find out why; he person he's looking after doesn't need help because she's driving a Volkswagen Polo! 
People have some funny ideas about guardian angels and stuff like that but that's not the point here. The point is that God Himself takes a personal interest in looking out for you, even when you don't know you're in danger! Psalm 91 says: 'This I declare about the Lord: He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; he is my God, and I trust him. For he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease. He will cover you with his feathers. He will shelter you with his wings. His faithful promises are your armour and protection.'  (Psalm 91:2-4 NLT). These words flow from a heart that has found complete security in God. Yes, the Bible also makes it clear that life will get tough at times but even then there will be no safer place than in God's arms.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do everything written in it. Then you will be...successful.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 1:8 NIV</span><br>People in the Bible, especially in the Old Testament, often refer to God's Word as His law. Why? Well laws govern, guide, and guard us. Without laws all you have is confusion. Imagine living in a world where 100cm no longer makes one metre and 2+2 doesn't make 4. God's Word creates the boundaries within which the world works. When people start operating outside of the limits set by God's Word the result is chaos. Just flick to News 24 and see the proof!  
Once again we can find a lesson here from Joshua. At the time he was taking over the leadership of the nation from Moses, God spoke to him about His law: 'Do everything written in it. Then you will be...successful.' Did you get that, everything. God's laws are not like a McDonald's menu; you can't pick what you like and leave the rest. You have to have the lot! You can't just pick up your Bible and skim over the bits that sound painful or difficult. Paul says to Timothy, 'All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right' (2 Timothy 3:16 NLT) If your life is confusing and chaotic start living by God's laws.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be careful to obey all the law.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 1:7 NIV</span><br>Do you know the story of Alice in Wonderland? At one point she meets the Cheshire cat and asks him: 'Would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?' 'That depends on where you want to get,' the cat replies. 'I don't care much where,' she answers. 'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' the cat responds. People with an 'I don't care' attitude just drift through life like a ball of tumbleweed - they never really put down any roots and its impossible for them to bear any fruit. Joshua wasn't like that. He had a clear sense of direction. Let's take another look at his story.
God said: 1) 'Get ready to cross...into the land' (Joshua 1:2 NIV). The frustrating thing about preparation is, sometimes it takes more time than the actual event you're preparing for. There's an old saying: 'You can claim to be surprised once; after that, you're unprepared' 2) 'Your territory will extend from...' (Joshua 1:4 NIV). You have to know the boundaries that God has set for you so that you don't step outside his blessing 3) 'Be careful to obey all the law...that you may be successful.' Our spiritual values are principles to be lived by every day. They give stability and structure to our inner world. And when that world is in order, we can step out and face anything - in our own shoes!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I will never leave you nor forsake you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 1:5 NIV</span><br>It's a bit of a weird saying isn't it  'filling someone else's shoes'? It's really just code for: 'Listen pipsqueak, so-and-so was a total living legend but to be honest you're a no-hoper'. When you put it like that the only shoes that are gonna get filled are yours - with poo! But this is the situation Joshua found himself in after 40 years serving as assistant to Moses the great deliverer, law-giver and best buddy of Almighty God.  'Do I have what it takes?' Joshua asked himself. 
God must've heard him because the beginning of the book of Joshua is filled with amazing words from the Big Boss to the new recruit. God told him: a) 'I will give you every place where you set your foot' (Joshua 1:3 NIV). God promises success to those who have the faith to take the first step, and to keep walking with Him.b) 'No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life' (Joshua 1:5 NIV). Expect opposition; people will try to get in your way but they can't stop God's promises! c) 'Be strong and courageous, for you are the one who will lead these people...' (Joshua 1:6 NIV). When the job feels too big and you feel too small don't be ashamed to ask God for a word of hope, He'll remind you of His calling so that you can stand in His power.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Giving a gift can open doors; it gives access to important people!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 18:16 NLT</span><br>We often talk about the way that God gives people 'gifts'. When we say this we're referring to certain talents and abilities that a person may have; for instance, you might be able make people laugh by the way you tell stories, but your sister might be a real brainbox. Different people, different gifts. But this Proverb is actually talking about gifts in the touchy-feely sense of the word, in fact, it almost sounds like bribery! Yes, your giftedness will get you noticed, and may give you a head start on others but you need to combine your gifting with generosity. 
How do you feel when someone gives you a gift? You feel special, right? You think, 'Hey, thanks, you noticed me.' Well, that's what this Proverb is getting at. Giving a gift to someone sends out the signal that you aren't only interested in yourself; you're a giver, not just a taker. Haven't you known people who had all the talent they'd ever need, but they never got the big break they deserved? Their talent made them stand out but their lack of generosity revealed their self-centredness. Who wants to give a big break to a person like that? Their talent might be able to push open the door, but their lack of concern for anyone but themselves slams it shut again.
There's a reason they call Proverbs 'the wisdom book'!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY FATHER AND MOTHER WALKED OUT AND LEFT ME, BUT GOD TOOK ME IN. </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 27:10 </span><br>Most of us at some point have lost someone close to us. You might have had a close friend who moved a long way away, or perhaps someone close to you passed away before their time, or maybe your family has felt the pain of a divorce. Going through life without the hugs and support you need can make you really struggle and even find it difficult to understand who you are. When you grow up listening to endless arguments but never seeing affection, it's easy to think that's normal, then in a few years when it's your turn you can't help wondering 'How should I act as a parent, and why do I still feel like a lost child?' David said, 'My father and mother walked out and left me, but God took me in' (Psalm 27:10 TM). How about that! God can hold you and heal your pain. When you're hurting, you can get on His couch and He'll be your 'Wonderful Counsellor' (Isaiah 9:6). When you feel like an orphan, He can be to you an 'Everlasting Father' who doesn't abandon His kids, no matter what. With Him you're always safe and protected, because that's what loving fathers do. You're His child, which means if something's important to you, it's important to Him too! What's more, He can send people into your life who'll be to you, the father, the mother, the brother, or the sister you never had. Listen, 'God sets the lonely in families...' (Psalm 68:6 NIV). Don't be so focused on what you don't have that you miss out on having Him in your life making it better.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO [SHOW]...KINDNESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Peter 1:5-7 NIV</span><br>Have you noticed that the busier you get the meaner you get? That's because kindness (the opposite of mean-ness) is a 'fruit of the Spirit,' it grows in your life as you spend time with God (Galatians 5:22). Kindness doesn't grow as the result of listening to a good preach you downloaded from iTunes. You have to practice it. You have to do what Peter says: 'Make every effort to [show]...kindness.'
One morning William McKinley was riding to his office on a tram. A sick woman got on and couldn't find a seat so she hung onto an overhead strap next to one of McKinley's political colleagues. Pathetically this guy hid behind his newspaper to avoid giving up his seat. Immediately McKinley gave her his seat and took her place in the aisle. Years later when McKinley had become President of the USA this same colleague was recommended for the position of ambassador but McKinley refused. He said, 'If his kindness is of the quality he showed that morning on the tram, I fear what he might do representing us in a foreign land.' The disappointed politician never did find out why McKinley chose someone else for the job. 
What good is it to be really busy if it's all to help yourself? Face it; without kindness what good are all our titles, traditions and testimonies? If you don't know the answer here it is: 'If I had the gift of prophecy and knew all about...the future, knew everything about everything, but didn't love others, what good would it do?' (1 Corinthians 13:2 TLB). So today, make up your mind to practice kindness!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT THINK IT STRANGE CONCERNING THE FIERY TRIAL WHICH IS TO TRY YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4:12 NKJV</span><br>Trouble never surprises God! Everyone He uses will tell you life is pretty much one challenge after another. Listen to how Paul describes the Christian life: 'In everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God. We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind. We have been beaten, been put in prison, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food. We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding, our patience, our kindness, by the Holy Spirit within us, and by our sincere love. We faithfully preach the truth. God's power is working in us. We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defence. We serve God whether people honour us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us. We are honest, but they call us imposters. We are ignored, even though we are well known. We live close to death, but we are still alive. We have been beaten, but we have not been killed. Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything' (2 Corinthians 6:4-10 NLT).
God never promised you that life would be a rose garden but did promise never to leave you, to take you through your storm and use all things for good in the end. When your faith is being tested it actually attracts God's power and brings His grace to your situation! Even Jesus learned through the things He suffered (Hebrews 5:8). So cheer up, you're not losing; you're learning!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>STRAINING TOWARD WHAT IS AHEAD, I PRESS ON TOWARD THE GOAL TO WIN THE PRIZE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:13-14 NIV</span><br>All rubber bands work on the same basis; they must be stretched to be effective! Anybody who has ever achieved anything worth mentioning has been stretched to their limit. There are no exceptions. Loads of people make the common mistakes of thinking that success in life is for clever people or some 'special something-or-other' you just don't have. Well that's rubbish! Success comes when you're up for something, you give it your all and really let yourself be stretched to meet the challenge. Failure comes when you shrink back from it. Now, stretching makes you vulnerable; think about that rubber band when it's pulled really tight, there's always that chance it's going to snap. Is that why you're afraid to stretch? To go where you haven't gone and do something new? Don't worry; you're more flexible than you think! 
In life you'll always have critics. Jesus had them. And He said, 'No servant is greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also' (John 15:20 NIV). Here's a modern example of how the criticism process usually works: Dr Jonas Salk, who invented the vaccine for the terrible disease Polio, got loads of flak from other medical professionals who didn't appreciate for his pioneering work. He found that criticism came in three stages. First they'll tell you, 'It won't work!' Then when you begin to succeed they'll say, 'What you're doing isn't really important!' Finally, after they see that it's important they'll say, 'We knew you'd do it all along!' So don't worry that you're not good enough. Just make yourself available to God and let Him show you what He can do with your life.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD SAID TO ABRAHAM, &quot;WHY DID SARAH LAUGH?&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 18:13 NIV</span><br>Have a little read of Genesis 18:13-14. In this passage we see God tell Abraham that his very old lady wife Sarah is going to have a baby. Not surprisingly Sarah did what any ninety something year old would do if someone said 'you're going to have a baby', she laughed her head off! God didn't really get what was so funny, especially when the following year, just as predicted she did indeed have a baby. After many years of desperation to be a mum and dealing with the fact that she couldn't have kids, when she popped out her son she called him Isaac which means, 'God has brought me laughter' (Genesis 21:2-6 NIV). There's a few things we learn from this. One is that God can do absolutely anything He wants. But another is a little deeper than that. Between the first and the last laugh Sarah went through a gut wrenching time of disappointment and heartache. Her hubby, Abraham, betrayed her to save his own skin and in the process a random King nearly ended up marrying her. Like Sarah you'll also celebrate good times and suffer some bad. Some days you'll feel like you can't go a step further, yet through it all you'll learn to trust God more than you ever dreamed possible. 
Here's an idea: when you share your story with other people don't just tell how you started or where you are today, tell them what God brought you through. The way God brings you through tough times gives Him as much glory as the good times, and chances are other people are having the same problems!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SAMSON PRAYED...&quot;LORD, REMEMBER ME...PLEASE STRENGTHEN ME JUST ONE MORE TIME.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 16:28 NLT</span><br>Have you ever read the story of Samson? It's worth a look. Here's a guy who has a massive weakness which seems to ruin him but in the end God uses him in a way few men have been. His weakness? A woman: 'She pressed him daily...and urged him' (Judges 16:16 NAS). Note the words pressed and urged. Be ready, your enemy will keep trying and all it takes is one moment of weakness to ruin everything. There are doors you should never open. There's an old saying that goes like this, 'Every morning in Africa a gazelle wakens and knows it has to run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa a lion wakens and knows it must outrun the swiftest gazelle or it will starve to death. It matters not whether you're a lion or a gazelle, when the sun comes up you'd better be ready to run!' Peter warns us to be alert because 'Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).
Samson remembered God! It's pretty awesome thing when someone runs back to God, and as always God was there patiently waiting, arms open the whole time. Samson's last recorded prayer was from a prison cell, 'Lord, remember me...please strengthen me one more time.' Was his prayer answered? Yes, and his final moments were used to bring havoc to the enemies of God. Regardless of where you are today or what shape you're in, turn to God. He'll straighten out the crooked places in your life and help you make a comeback!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AS THE CLAY IS IN THE POTTER'S HAND, SO ARE YOU IN MY HAND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 18:6 NLT</span><br>Jeremiah was told by God to go down to the potter's house and see how he made his pottery: 'The jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so [the potter] crushed it into a lump of clay...and started over' (Jeremiah 18:4 NLT). Sounds a bit harsh considering we're supposed to be like the clay. But, the potter crushed the clay in order to make something loads better out of it! Here's the good news: life may have  crushed you but you're still in God's hands! Your family and friends may think you're a waste of space or beyond repair but God doesn't and His opinion is what counts. Your life may seem to be out of control today but in reality you're still on the potter's wheel - being stretched, shaped and moulded. 'As the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand.'
One day a friend of Michelangelo saw him working on a piece of marble he'd found on a rubbish dump. When he asked Michelangelo what he was doing he replied: 'There's an angel inside and I'm going to bring him out.' How good is that? From a rubbish dump piece of reject rock to a priceless work of art. That's what our God does! Hannah said 'He raises the poor from the dust...To set them among princes' (1 Samuel 2:8 NKJV). You're not born qualified; you become qualified by spending time with Jesus. So stay where God has you today and let Him keep working on you. Tomorrow you'll be glad you did.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE MERCIFUL, JUST AS YOUR FATHER IS MERCIFUL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 6:36 NIV</span><br>The award-winning writer Ernest Hemingway tells the story of a father and his teenage son who lived in Spain. Their relationship fell apart and the son ran away from home. After a few years the father began the long journey looking for his boy, and after a long time, he put an ad in the Madrid newspaper as a last resort. His son's name was Paco (a very common name in Spain). It just read, 'Dear Paco, meet me in front of the Madrid newspaper office tomorrow at noon. All is forgiven. I love you.' The next day at noon, in front of the newspaper office there were 800 Pacos all looking for forgiveness! 
Whom do you need to forgive today? Forgive them! You can't have a sorted relationship with God if you have a load of un-sorted issues with other people. Yes, people will hurt us, especially those we're close to. Letting go of hurt (especially when you've been wronged) is really hard to do, but not impossible. We tend to want revenge or at least for everyone to know what really happened. But when you won't forgive someone the truth is it's you that hurts. For one thing, you weren't created to carry the stress that goes with bearing a grudge! Indeed there's a mountain of medical evidence to say that holding onto resentment can actually destroy your health. If you think you'll ever need mercy, show it. Jesus said, 'Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy' (Matthew 5:7 NIV). Is God speaking to you about this? If so, deal with it today. Don't put it off any longer!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD DIRECTS THE STEPS OF THE GODLY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 37:23 NLT</span><br>Has something so painful happened that it's left you feeling scarred and a bit useless? Have you experienced people picking on things about you that's left you very sensitive and insecure? Do you find it difficult to trust people? Ever wonder why God made you that way? If that's where you're at today read these words: 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives. Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand' (Psalm 37:23-24 NLT). Do you believe that? Ask God right now to root those words deep in your heart.
You see, God loves to use people who aren't perfect, which pretty much includes all of us! It's often hard to understand often why God made us that way, yet if you give Him time and a chance you're guaranteed a good reason. When people with big flaws are used for Gods glory, God gets even more glory because they clearly couldn't have done it by themselves. God loves to bless people with flaws they aren't arrogant like those people who think they deserve it. They're usually warmer and much more willing to give others a chance too. They understand that without God they never would have made it. Don't limit what you think you're capable of or what you want to do with your life - just because you're not perfect or not the best at something. God is capable of anything and if you're willing to be used, then you can't possibly begin to imagine the things he has in store for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL BLESS THE LORD AT ALL TIMES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 34:1</span><br>David said, 'I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.' It may sound like a very sweet, Christian thing to say, but is it realistic? Absolutely! A thankful heart really should be a way of life. Did you know that a thankful heart can even save your life? When Jonah legged it from God then ended up in the belly of the whale he told God, 'I will sacrifice to You with... thanksgiving' (Jonah 2:9 NKJV). And when he did God gave the whale a dose of collywobbles and it spewed Jonah up onto the beach! When you're down in the dumps and all hell's breaking loose around you, that's when you need to raise your voice and praise God. When you can still praise God in a crisis, that's real faith. When your lips are full of thanksgiving and praise, even if you're not feeling it, this has a massive effect on your life and builds your faith no end. The reason we can walk by faith and not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7), is because we know that whatever is going on right now, God is working on our behalf. David said, 'Magnify the Lord with me!' (Psalm 34:3). Praise acts like a magnifying glass; it helps you realise that God is much bigger than your problem. Nothing has really changed apart from your focus! Instead of sulking and moping about the problem, your faith is released and you start wanting solutions (we all like a bit of self-pity sometimes) and looking to God for them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:37 NIV</span><br>Yesterday we learned some lessons from Paul's shipwreck experience. Today let's look at getting out of one without losing everything! 
1) Prepare for the storm before you get into it! The wise man built his house on a rock because he understood that life is never smooth, sooner or later a storm will come along (Matthew 7:24). 'For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him' (Philippians 1:29 NIV). Being prepared for a storm will help get you through it. 
2) Stay calm! Panic kills more pilots than bad weather because it clouds their ability to think. In the storm Jesus said to His disciples, 'It is I; don't be afraid' (Mark 6:50). Get your eyes fixed on Jesus and keep them there, otherwise your fear will take over and you'll be all over the place. If you're not looking to Jesus you're either looking at the problem, frantically searching for a solution or looking for other people to support you and sort things out. None of these are going to get you through in one piece like looking at Jesus in the first place. 
3) Never abandon your purpose! They threw their cargo, the purpose for their journey, overboard. Don't do it! Never let go of the plans God called you to because it's these goals that will sustain you through the hard times. Later Paul would write, 'We know that all things work together for good...to them who are the called according to his purpose' (Romans 8:28). So be strong; the storm doesn't decide your future, God does. He's still in charge.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WISELY AND TENDERLY LEAD ME, AND THEN YOU BLESS ME</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 73:24 TM</span><br>Your life is like a voyage. If you want to avoid a shipwreck read Acts 27:12 (NIV) and notice the following things: 
1) They thought they knew best. 'Since the harbor was unsuitable...the majority decided that we should sail on.' God doesn't guide us by the majority vote, He guides us by His Spirit.  
2) They were impatient to get to where they were going. There's not a single verse in the Bible that tells us to hurry up or we'll miss God! In the wilderness Israel learned that when the cloud moves, you move; when the cloud stops, stay where you are and wait on God. 
3) They failed to listen to God's Word. 'But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot' (Acts 27:11 NIV). Be careful, if you look hard enough you'll find someone who just agrees with what you want to do and that can get you into trouble. 
4) They looked to the circumstances instead of God to guide them. 'When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they...sailed. Before very long...The ship was caught by the storm' (Acts 27:13-15 NIV). The idea that if the circumstances work out right it must be God's plan isn't biblical, in fact for many people in the Bible the proof was the total opposite. Sometimes God leads you through the problem, not around it. He'll never lead you anywhere that doesn't require His provision and protection. So if you want to avoid shipwreck ask God to show you the right way, which is His way!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER IN PSALMS, HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS. SING AND MAKE MUSIC IN YOUR HEART TO THE LORD</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>(EPHESIANS 5:19 NIV)</span><br>The Bible is stuffed full of what GOD has to say about the things WE say. Words are powerful, they can big you up or batter you down and how we speak to ourselves and each other makes a difference.  Paul talks about the importance of using the words in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. So why are they so important?
1) Get Real: Check out the psalms and you will find the songwriters are full on with their honesty. They are keeping it real with God and with other people. Check out Psalm 51. Imagine writing a song about how you messed up and then it gets released in the charts, so everyone knows. God loves this honesty and it's good for us for when we are real with Him.
2) Get Close: Hymns and songs help us get closer to God. They can express something that we could just think of or say. God loves to get close to people who are singing or rapping about how much they adore Him.
3) Get the true view: When we big God up through spiritual songs it helps us to see things as they really are! He is our awesome, all powerful Dad, who is in total control of our lives and problems! 
Today most of your words to God and Christian mates will be about friends, family, school, the person you fancy. The more that you use words to big God up the bigger the difference it will make to your day. Don't wait until Sunday, bang on your best Christian CD and let rip!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE MUST BEAR THE 'BURDEN' OF BEING CONSIDERATE OF THE DOUBTS AND FEARS OF OTHERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 15:2 TLB</span><br>Today we're going think about that person in your youth group that winds everyone up. In every group there's at least one real pain. The thing is, Jesus even loves annoying people (which is good news for you eh?)! So, will we love them as sisters and brothers and treat them with respect? In a real family acceptance isn't based on how smart, beautiful or talented you are; it's based on the fact that you belong to each other. 'Be devoted to each other like a loving family. Excel in showing respect' (Romans 12:10 GWT). It's the same deal with your youth group; you are family! 
'But you don't know how annoying they are!'  Ok, but try and put yourself in their shoes and understand where that person is coming from. When you know what they've been through or is still going through it'll help you be more understanding. Sometimes a person's whole attitude and their annoying behaviour can change when they think people are listening to them.  So another part of showing consideration is not downplaying other people's doubts or difficulties. Just because you don't have a problem with something doesn't mean you don't take their problems seriously! People need a safe place to share their struggles and make mistakes without being judged. Oh yeah, and they have a right to expect confidentiality! What's shared in your group needs to stay in your group, and your group needs to deal with it, not go out and blab about it to others. Only in the safe place of acceptance will people open up and share their deepest needs. So show some love this week!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FORGET WHAT HAPPENED LONG AGO! DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PAST. I AM CREATING SOMETHING NEW</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43:18-19</span><br>It's not God who's bringing up your past mess ups and mistakes! His Word says, 'But I wipe away your sins because of who I am. And so, I will forget the wrongs you have done' (Isaiah 43:25 CEV). Satan loves dragging up your past; the Bible calls him an accuser. He will bring up old memories in an attempt to discourage you, saying 'you're no good', 'you'll never change,' that 'God doesn't use people who have done stuff THAT bad'. Don't let him lie to you! The Bible says: 'Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way' (NIV). God has given you a new start. God is going to make a way for you!
By the way, you don't need to keep coming back to God time and time again saying sorry for the stuff you did three days, months, or years ago.  Everyday we need to know that we mess up, we need to decide that we want to change and ask forgiveness, then it's done; God has forgotten it. 
As surely as Pharaoh and Herod tried to wipe out every baby boy in order to get at Moses and Jesus, so satan will do whatever it takes to keep you from reaching your destiny or being the person God created you to be. A big way he does that it to trap you in the past. The battle is always over your future! No matter what your past is like your future is worth fighting for - so rise up and fight!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE ONE WHO IS IN YOU IS GREATER THAN THE ONE WHO IS IN THE WORLD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 4:4 NIV</span><br>Robbie Williams had a teacher who thought he was a 'kid who wouldn't amount to much'.  What must that teacher feel like now? The world-famous author, Rudyard Kipling received a rejection letter after applying for a job with a newspaper, it said, 'Sorry Mr. Kipling, but you just don't know how to use the English language.' After a lifetime of defeats, at 62, Winston Churchill became one of Britain's greatest Prime Ministers. Einstein's schoolteachers described him as, 'mentally slow, unsociable and adrift in his foolish dreams.' By age 46, Beethoven was completely deaf, yet he wrote some of his greatest symphonies without hearing a note. 
Life is about overcoming! You conquer one mountain, and then before you know it you're faced with the next; a bigger one. Remember Peter who denied Jesus in a moment of weakness, and Jonah who ran from the call of God because he was afraid?  We can all mess up or want to give up. In every story of victory there are chapters of defeat. But by God's grace you can overcome! That's why the Bible says: 'The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.' Hudson Taylor, an amazing missionary said, 'Many Christians estimate difficulty in the light of their own resources, thus they attempt very little and they always fail. The real giants have all been weak people who did great things for God because they reckoned on His power and His presence to be with them.' Bottom line: God has got your back, don't worry about failing, worry about what you're going to tell God if you don't even try!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANYONE WOULD COME AFTER ME, HE MUST DENY HIMSELF ...TAKE UP HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>(MATTHEW 16:24 NIV)</span><br>1) Deny yourself: When you became a Christian you put Jesus in the driving seat of your life! He's in control and decides what direction your life is going. We've all heard of back seat drivers, passengers who tell the driver what to do 'Speed up!', 'slow down!'. Don't become a back seat driver to Jesus, saying He's in control but also wanting things your own way. Denying yourself means trusting Jesus knows best for your life and not just going in the direction or speed you think is right! 
2) Take up your cross. In a letter to a church, Paul says: 'I die daily' (1 Corinthians 15:31). Certain things in your life can be handled only one way; dying to them, cutting them off. 'Sin speaks a dead language that means nothing to you...You are dead to sin and alive to God' (Romans 6:11 MSG). If a manager could have the world's best striker join their football team, they would seriously consider selling off their current striker. Jesus wants us to give Him space in our lives each day which means sacking anything that gets in His way or becomes more important. Die to sin but gain Jesus!  
3) Follow Him. It is not God's job to follow you, it is your job to follow Him! When you do, it will cost you, change you, and challenge you. Sometimes you will have a rough ride, other times you will be cruising. You must be willing to follow Him anywhere, any time, under any conditions; that is the deal! Still want to be a disciple of Jesus?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE SHOULD MAKE PLANS - COUNTING ON GOD TO DIRECT US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:9 TLB</span><br>It's said when Christopher Columbus (one of the first European explorers to discover America) set out he didn't know where he was going, when he arrived he didn't know where he was, and when he returned didn't know where he'd been! From time to time we all need help knowing which direction to go; which college or university to go to, should you take a certain job, or whether or not to start going out with that special someone! The Bible says, 'We should make plans - counting on God to direct us.' So how does He lead us? Through: 
1) The Bible: 'Let the word of Christ -the message- have the run of the house. Give it plenty of room in your lives' (Colossians 3:16 TM). One author writes: 'The Bible is to God what a surgical glove is to a surgeon. He reaches through it to touch deep within you.' But that requires reading it, personalizing it, and acting on it. 
2) Prayer and listening for His voice: Jesus said, 'My sheep listen to my voice; I know them and they follow me' (John 10:27 NIV).It can take time to learn to listen not just talk at God, try going for a walk, find a quiet place, give yourself time. Write down what you think Jesus might be saying-does it match what the bible says? Learn to listen. 
3) Get Advice: other people have gone through the same stuff as you, so 'Remember what kind of lives they lived and try to have faith like theirs' (Hebrews 13:17 CEV). Remember your youth leaders, pastors and yes, even parents, were your age once! They can help.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WANTED...TO WRITE...ABOUT...SALVATION...BUT...FELT THE NEED TO WRITE YOU ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jude 3 NCV</span><br>The author Max Lucado writes, 'I awoke early one morning for a meeting...[and] spotted a bag of cookies. Our daughter had attended a bake sale so I thought she must've set them out for me. I ate one...interesting texture...I ate a second...with coffee it made an interesting option. I grabbed a third for the road, and would have grabbed the fourth but only one remained. Later my wife phoned, &quot;Looks like someone's been in the bag.&quot; &quot;It was me,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I've had better breakfast cookies but those weren't bad.&quot; &quot;Those weren't breakfast cookies,&quot; she replied, &quot;they were homemade dog biscuits!&quot; All day when I scratched my belly, my leg kicked...not to mention my interest in fire hydrants! I should've consulted the maker.' 
The Bible says, 'God is working in you to help you...do what pleases him' (Philippians 2:13 NCV). So when you sense a 'but God' holding you back in your spirit He's probably trying to get your attention for a good reason. He promised to 'guide you along the best pathway for your life....advise...and watch over you' (Psalm 32:8 NLT) so you need to listen to Him and do what He says! Jude said, 'I wanted very much to write you about salvation...But I felt the need to write...about something else.' Jude wanted to dedicate his epistle to one topic but God had other plans. Get in the habit of asking God what to do, but also get in the habit of listening. You might have plans but God has His plans, so stop, ask and listen. Remember, when you ask, sometimes NO is just as important to hear as YES!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I...INTENDED TO BUILD...BUT GOD SAID.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Chronicles 28:2-3 NAS</span><br>Vincent was a missionary in a small coal mining village in Belgium. He preached to miners, looked after the injured, fed the hungry and after a while his little church was rammed with those eager to learn about Jesus. Vincent's bosses weren't happy though, because unlike most vicars at the time, Vincent wore old second-hand clothes, lived in a shack and gave his salary to the people. 'You look worse than the people you came to teach,' they said. 'Wouldn't Jesus have done the same?' Vincent asked. His bosses disagreed and he was told to leave the church. Vincent was hurt and angry; his only desire had been to build a church that glorified God, so why hadn't God let it happen? Then one day he watched an old miner struggling beneath a load of coal. Moved by the sight he began to sketch the bowed figure. And although he didn't realise it at the time, he'd discovered his real calling. The young preacher who was rejected by his denomination eventually became the now world famous artist: Vincent van Gogh. 
How do you react to the 'But God' interruptions in your life? Do you get mad at God? David said, 'I...intended to build a...home for the ark...But God said &quot;Your son Solomon...shall build My house&quot;' (1 Chronicles 28:2-6 NAS). When God axed his plans, David immediately followed his 'But God' with a 'Yet God,' and declared, 'Yet... God...took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel' (v. 4). Instead of complaining about what he didn't get to do, David buzzed about how God had already blessed him by promoting him from herding sheep to leading the Israelite nation!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS STOOD UP AND COMMANDED THE WIND AND SAID TO THE WAVES, 'QUIET! BE STILL!'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 4:39 NCV</span><br>In Mark Chapter 4 you'll find a story about how even the wind and waves were at Jesus' beck and call. In the middle of a raging storm Jesus stands up in the boat, tells the wind and the waves to chill out and... bosh! The sea is calm. Jesus' mates clock hold of this and think to themselves, 'Who is this? Even the wind and waves respect this guy'.
Life today is full of people who are trying to get respect, like the rappers on TV with women and bling hanging on them. Their whole attitude is 'you KNOW you want to be like me'. and a lot of people do! Or think of the toughest kid in school or on the streets that everyone wants to hang out with or go out with, yet you know that no matter how much respect they think they deserve none of these fakers get respect from creation itself! 
Because we know Jesus was full of love, some people seem to think that Jesus is some geek who is coming up to us saying: 'erm, excuse me, will you believe in me please, it will be really nice'. Sometimes we can think that we're doing Jesus a favour if we follow Him, or do what He says. No way. Jesus is the chief, the guv, 'da man' and He demands our respect more than anyone that's ever lived. Even the forces of nature listen to him, so shouldn't you?  If this doesn't sound like the Jesus you know, you haven't got to know Him yet, so what are you waiting for? Respect is due!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART, O GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:10 NLT </span><br>Jesus taught us that only the pure in heart would 'see God' (Matthew 5:8). The problem He's pointing out here is that our vision becomes dim when our heart is polluted. To the blind all things are invisible. Today's headline verse is the cry of David's heart when he was confessing his darkest sins to God. He fell on his knees and prayed: 'Create in me a clean heart, O God.' At this point in his life he'd stuffed up BIG TIME but he got this one thing right, he knew the best heart-cleaner in the business. Nothing or nobody else can produce purity in the deepest part of your being. You can't get it from the supermarket, you can't buy it off the internet. Only the blood of Jesus will remove those stains.    
Jesus himself said, 'You are clean because of the word I have spoken to you' (John 15:3). Time spent reading the Bible acts like a daily exfoliator (weird gritty cream your mum uses!) keeping you clean by exposing sins you're unaware of so that you can deal with them. Think of it like this: unidentified, unconfessed, sin is like dirt in your skin pores, which leads to what? Zits! In the same way, not scrubbing in the Word is a sure fire way to end up with a dodgy spiritual complexion! You'll find yourself constantly needing prayer instead of being in the place where you can offer prayer for others. In short, you need to be cleansed and then stay clean so that you can hear God and see the direction He's leading you in.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER AND BUILD EACH OTHER UP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:11 NIV</span><br>A famous singer was to perform at the Grand Opera House. The concert hall was packed. Suddenly the house manager announced, 'Ladies and gentlemen I regret that due to illness our special guest will be unable to perform this evening. But we've found another singer, an equally great talent, so would you please give her a warm welcome.' The crowd groaned so loudly that nobody even heard the singer's name. You could feel the disappointment everywhere. The stand-in singer gave it everything she had but when it was over all she got was shallow applause followed by uncomfortable silence. Suddenly there was the sound of a little voice from the balcony, a child shouting, 'Mum, you're amazing!' All of a sudden the crowd jumped to their feet and gave her a standing ovation that lasted for several minutes. 
There are people around you today who are hurting inside, crumbling under the load they silently carry, who never hear the words, 'You're amazing.' Why? a) because we're too embarrassed to say them b) we don't think they need to hear them because they seem so strong. Listen to what Paul writes, 'There was no rest for us... Battles on the outside and fear on the inside. But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus. His presence was a joy... so was the news he brought' (See 2 Corinthians 7:5-8 NLT). Even the Apostle Paul needed encouragement! So God sent the bloke called Titus. 'His presence was a joy...so was the news he brought.' God needs more people who will shout out from the balcony. Today you can be one of them!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TO ONE HE GAVE FIVE TALENTS, TO ANOTHER, TWO, AND TO ANOTHER, ONE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:15 NAS</span><br>In a world that celebrates fame and fortune how do you handle being Mr or Ms Invisible? Do you secretly resent the people who get the big breaks and the open-door opportunities? Before you answer consider this: there was only one Moses whose amazing career spans four Old Testament books, and only one Paul who was called to write half the New Testament. The rest of us are called to be heroes of a different kind, we're the 'iHeroes'; we are invisible, but important. Invisible because we are 1 out of 6 billion people on the planet and that's a very big crowd! Important because our value was established at the cross. So, when people overlook you, stop and remind yourself 'God values me so highly that He thought I was worth dying for.' 
Have you heard about the one-note musician? She unpacked her violin, took her seat in the orchestra, arranged her music sheets and tuned up her instrument. As the concert began the conductor cued one group of musicians after another until finally her moment arrived, the time for her one note to be played! The conductor signalled, she played the note and the moment was over. Just like that! The orchestra played on and the one-note player sat there quietly for the rest of the concert; not disappointed that she'd played only one note but with a sense of fulfilment that she'd played it in tune, on time, and with style!
Have you heard of Ananias? He shows up once in the Bible, to leads Paul to Christ, then bye (Acts 9:10-19). He's a one-note player, but what a note! Take a lead from him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AN HONEST ANSWER IS A SIGN OF TRUE FRIENDSHIP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 24:26 TEV</span><br>It's tempting to keep quiet when your mates are messing up, you don't want to sound like a grumpy old man - but keeping shtum isn't the loving thing to do. Most people have no one in their lives who loves them enough to tell them the truth, so they continue going the wrong way making bigger and bigger mistakes. Usually we know what needs to be said but fear keeps us from saying it. If you ever find yourself in that situation remember this proverb: 'An honest answer is the sign of true friendship.' Sometimes caring means confronting, or, as they say, dishing out some 'tough love'.  Are you willing to be that sort of friend? It's the only sort of friend worth having. 
Paul writes, 'If someone in your group does something wrong, you who are spiritual should go to that person and gently make him right again' (Galatians 6:1 NCV). That's what 'spiritual' people do! The trouble is when an issue pops up that might cause tension it's immediately glossed over in order to preserve the peace. Mr. 'Don't-rock-the-boat' jumps in and tries to smooth everyone's ruffled feathers, the issue is never resolved and everyone lives with a feeling of frustration. 'No more pretence. Tell the truth. In Christ's body we're all connected to each other...When you lie to others, you end up lying to yourself' (Ephesians 4:25 TM). Now, truth without love can really sting, thoughtless words hurt people but the bottom line is: whether in a friendship, a family or even a church, until we care enough to confront and resolve the real issues, we'll never grow close to each other!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>UNTIL THE TIME CAME TO FULFILL HIS WORD, THE LORD TESTED JOSEPH'S CHARACTER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 105:19 NLT</span><br>It's hard to watch God blessing other people while you're struggling to get by. But before you throw a strop and say 'it's so unfair!' remember, it's just God's calendar, your time will come. We've mentioned Joseph quite a few times in this edition and once again his story is so relevant. His faith was tested by the massive promises God gave him. You can almost hear the voices in his head whispering: 'I thought your dream said you were supposed to be sitting on a throne. What are you doing sat here in prison then? God doesn't care about you.' But Joseph never gave in to negativity. He held on to those dreams. He knew God doesn't change His mind, so he made sure he didn't change his! 
When you follow where God leads you can find yourself in the weirdest places, places that don't always seem like they are going to be good places. But there's always a reason. God told the prophet Elijah to go and hide himself in a dusty ravine by a brook where his only friends were birds (1 Kings 17:3). Only later was the importance of this time revealed. This time hidden away with God focused him on the challenge ahead, defeating a twisted queen and her evil priests.  Listen: 'The Lord will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right' (Psalm 84:11 NLT). His delays are not denials. He's never said anything He couldn't back up or promised anything He wouldn't deliver. So try thinking a bit less about your surroundings and a bit more about the Word God has given you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I THANK MY GOD EVERY TIME I REMEMBER YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 1:3 NIV</span><br>There's a true story of a little boy whose sister needed a blood transfusion. The doctor explained she had the same disease that he'd recovered from two years earlier. Her only chance of recovery was a transfusion from someone who'd already beat it, so the boy was the perfect donor. 'Would you give your blood to Mary?' the doctor asked. Johnny paused, his lower lip trembled, and then he smiled and said, 'For my sister, yes I will.' Soon the two children were wheeled into the hospital room; Mary, pale and thin; Johnny, fit and healthy. Neither spoke, but when their eyes met Johnny grinned. But as the nurse inserted the needle into his arm Johnny's smile faded. He watched the blood flow through the tube. After a little while Johnny's voice, slightly shaky, broke the silence. 'Doctor, when do I die?' Only then did the doctor realise why little Johnny had paused and why his lips trembled when he agreed to donate his blood. He thought giving his blood to his sister meant giving up his life. In that brief moment he'd made an awesome decision. 
Who would give their life for you? Whoever they are, they are the people you should be making time for. They are the ones you need to show your appreciation for; now, while you still can. They are irreplaceable! When they're gone you'll realise that. Some of the things you're striving for now will seem empty then. Some of the things you're upset over now will seem pointless then. So squeeze the most out of every moment you get with them. Create memories you'll treasure with those who matter!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD GRANTED HIS REQUEST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CHRONICLES 4:10 NIV</span><br>Jabez is an ancient name that means 'a cause of pain'. Imagine growing up with a name like that!  But this Jabez refused to wear the loser label and you should too! You don't need to wear any of the labels people try to stick on you. Your identity is that you are a unique child of the awesome God and nothing less. The Bible says that you were in God's mind before you were in your mother's womb (See Psalm 139:13-15). 
Jabez wouldn't let his beginnings dictate his end. He refused to allow his family to keep him down and his bounderies to keep him in. Listen to his prayer, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain.'  God granted his request. OK, so at first it seems like a bit of a selfish prayer, it doesn't really beat in time with the rhythm of prayer Jesus taught his disciples in Matthew Chapter 6 but something about it obviously got through to God because he answered it.  
It's not very often that we read about Jesus being 'amazed' but interestingly the times He is are times when He meets people who have a determined faith that He will do the thing they ask Him for. You can be sure that Jesus has not changed and He will still respond to anyone who dares to believe that He has the power to do the things He has promised in His Word. The question is, do you? Well, be like Jabez and get praying.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:10</span><br>We're gonna dig out a bit of history today. A couple of hundred years ago, before the British and the French imposed national boundaries on Southeast Asia, the kings of Laos and Vietnam already had an agreement about who was Laotian and who was Vietnamese. Those who ate short-grain rice, built their houses on stilts and decorated their homes with Indian-style serpents were considered Laotians. Those who ate long-grain rice, built their houses on the ground, and decorated their homes with Chinese-style dragons were Vietnamese. The kings taxed the people accordingly so they had no need for boundaries. It was simple; each person belonged to the kingdom whose values they shared and whose king they honoured! 
Understand this: you can only live by the values of one of two kingdoms: the kingdom of darkness or the kingdom of light. Which have you chosen? Each time you choose God's way in your life the kingdom of God comes into the world through you. When you live out his values the prayer Jesus taught us is answered, 'Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' 
So how do citizens of God's nation act? Jesus says a) they aren't big-headed b) they live by God's priorities c) they're hungry and thirsty for more of God d) they show compassion to others e) they have a pure heart f) they are peacemakers g) they stay positive, even in hard times h) they know their reward is waiting for them (Matthew 5:3-12). What the world knows about the nation of God is what is displayed in our lives! That's a big responsibility!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU INTENDED TO HARM ME, BUT GOD INTENDED IT FOR GOOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 50:20 NIV</span><br>So maybe you're not exactly looking forward to 2008. Maybe you can learn from the story of Joseph? a) your future is in the palace not in the pit! b) your future isn't in the hands of other people, it's in the hands of God c) your future doesn't require the cooperation of everyone else, but it does require the cooperation of one person; you! 
In his life Joe was on the receiving end of a whole load of agro. His brothers sold him to a gang of human traffickers. His boss's wife lied about him, saying he tried to grope her. His best mate in prison turned his back on him, but God didn't abandon him! He arranged every step Joseph took, all the way to becoming Prime Minister. There's a really special moment in his story when he stands face to face with his brothers, the ones who sold him to the gang when he was just a teenager, and says: 'You intended to harm me; but God intended it for good.' 
Get this: No one can prevent God from using you, blessing you and giving you success, except you. So keep your heart and your attitude right! For everything there's a reason and a season. Maybe you can't understand it at the moment, so just hold tight to what God's promised you. Instead of looking for someone to blame, look for the hand of God in your situation. Remember what the Bible says: 'All that happens to us is working for our good if we love God and are fitting into his plans' (Romans 8:28 TLB).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS WOULD OFTEN GO TO SOME PLACE WHERE HE COULD BE ALONE AND PRAY</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 5:16</span><br>OK, January 1st, time for an honesty check! Have you been living 2007 with a bit of a 'Go-faster stripes' attitude? Do you ever catch yourself thinking, 'If God has anything to say to me today He'd better hurry up and say it?' It's so easy to get like this. The 21st century 'microwave mentality' demands everything instantly, including spiritual maturity. That's why today, seeing as it's a bank holiday, we're gonna chill.  Sorry no, let's-hurry-up-so-we-can-get-on-with-it today!
When was the last time you really made an effort to listen to God and get direction? Well, what better day than today to set aside some proper time to talk to God. Get out of the house, take a hike, download some worship trax onto that new MP3 player you got for Crimbo and stretch those legs. Stick a Bible in your pocket, or in your rucksack, or stuff it in your coat and grab a felt-tip to mark the bits that the Holy Spirit leads you to. If you want God to work through you this year then you need to let Him work in you today. 
The Bible says, 'Jesus would often go to some place where he could be alone and pray' (Luke 5:16 CEV). Loneliness is the price of hearing from God and walking in His will. There's no shortcut to any place worth going. If prayer was part of the life of Christ, shouldn't it be a part of yours? Don't get so busy with other things that you lose sight of what's important; doing what God wants you to do!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL ARISE AND GO TO MY FATHER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 15:18</span><br>In Luke 15 a son demands his inheritance money before he's ready for it. It turns out to be the worst thing to ever happen to him. Earlier in this chapter Jesus tells two other stories about a shepherd who went looking for a lost sheep and a woman who went looking for her lost silver. They were lost accidentally, but this kid left on purpose. He 'packed up everything he owned and left for a foreign country, where he wasted all his money in wild living. He had spent everything, when a bad famine spread through that whole land. Soon he had nothing to eat' (Luke 15:13-16 CEV). The turning point of the story is when the son says, 'I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, &quot;Father, I have sinned.&quot;' Notice three important statements: a) 'I will arise.' Everybody falls; the winners are the ones who get back up again b) 'And go back to my father.' If you're sick of religion or trying and constantly failing - try Jesus, He won't disappoint you! c) 'And will say unto him, &quot;Father, I have sinned.&quot;' Today, pray and make things right between you and your heavenly Father. This lad took himself away and he let himself down, but he picked himself up and he brought himself back. The same goes for you! 
Solomon writes, 'There is a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death' (Proverbs 14:12 NIV). What seems like a good idea today may cost you seriously tomorrow. So trust God when He says 'No', he's not being tight, He can see what's best for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL GUIDE THEM...I WILL NOT FORSAKE THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 42:16 NIV</span><br>One day when he was skiing in Colorado, a bloke saw some people wearing red vests with the words BLIND SKIER. He thought, 'I have a hard enough time skiing with two good eyes, how can they ski properly with none?' The answer was that they had a guide whose instructions they totally trusted and followed! As the guide skied beside them, he'd tap his ski poles together and assure them he was there. Then he'd say, 'Go right! Turn left! Stop! Slow! Skier coming up on your right!' 
What a picture. So often life can be like skiing downhill blind. We can't see even five seconds into the future. We can't see the struggles ahead or the steepness of the mountain right in front of us. It becomes even scarier when we think about all the other 'skiers' who've run into us, or over us in the past. Humanly speaking it leaves even the strongest of us feeling vulnerable and unsafe. And that's when we need to place our confidence in the God who never changes and never fails. Here's what He has to say to you today: 'I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths. I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them' (Isaiah 42:16 NIV). What is it that gets you through the unfamiliar places, the dark places and the rough places in life? God's rock-solid promise: 'I will guide [you]...I will not forsake [you].' And His assurance is all you need!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD ANSWERED HIM, I WILL BE WITH YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JUDGES 6:16</span><br>Life is a battle. Whether it's a battle with health, your friends, your enemies, your church leaders, your neighbours, your work mates, unemployment, money, peer pressure, parents, bullies, relationships with the opposite sex, depression or countless other things, life usually feels like it's 'one thing after another'. When you're in the middle of a battle, God has a strategy for you. Even if it's a battle you should never have got into (sinful habits or things that all your mates do) then God has a strategy to get you out. When you pray and ask God to help you in the battle, ask Him for a strategy to win the battle! God knows what you can handle, He knows the pressures you're under and He knows exactly how you're wired. God has a master plan for everything, even when the battle or mess you're in is your fault! One of the amazing things about God is His ability to turn even the worst possible situation around for His glory; but you can only do that by following God's strategy! 
Remember though, you may have already heard God's strategy but you're looking for another because you don't like it, or you want something easier. A God-given way out is not always pain-free. Sometimes it means owning up to things, admitting problems, confronting situations or, heaven forbid, actually apologizing! Coming through these situations is what helps us to grow up, mature and learn big lessons in life. You can't avoid them forever. So today think about your battles; maybe it's time to put into action that winning strategy you've been putting off for so long?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE ON YOUR GUARD!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 20:31 NIV</span><br>Years ago in California there were some enormous mud slides. Beautiful houses ended up being trashed as the earth literally slid out from under them. You see, when the foundation crumbles, even the most expensive houses will fall. Thank God that the foundation we have in Him can't be shaken... or can it? These days there's no shortage of Christian teaching; just turn on the TV or go online and it's there waiting for you. However, when you take a proper look you can see there's a teaspoon of truth in an ocean of error. Sadly some people hungry for a slice of fame can think of a new idea then find a Bible verse to back it up. But that's not what the Bible's there for. If you steal a few random words from here and there you can make the Bible say anything you want to say! 
In the Bible a group called the Bereans used their heads when it came to this. 'They received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true' (Acts 17:11 NIV). Even the great leader Paul's words were checked against what scripture actually said, so no one is above this, including the  Word 4U 2day! Anytime someone claims a revelation that doesn't line up with the Bible run the opposite direction. That may sound harsh but so is surgery and it'll save your life! So, always ask God to help you. Remember, Paul warned: 'men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. So be on your guard!' (Acts 20:30-31 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE MEN OF ISRAEL LOOKED THEM OVER AND ACCEPTED THE EVIDENCE. BUT THEY DIDN'T ASK GOD ABOUT IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 9:14 TM</span><br>It's hard to stay humble when you've just walked through the Red Sea without getting wet and conquered Jericho, the biggest city in the Promised Land. But getting cocky can be deadly! After their massive victories the Israelites got way too big for their boots and totally forgot to ask God about what to do next, and the results were pretty bad. The crafty people from Gibeon realised they couldn't beat God's people so they sent out a team of negotiators to make peace with them and it worked! Joshua had no idea they were lying to him and signed a peace treaty. It was one of the biggest mistakes of his life! From that day on these people made life very difficult for Joshua and the twelve tribes who lived to regret that he 'didn't ask God about it.' You probably won't have to get involved in complicated military situations like that but that's no reason not to pray. 
It's frightening how quickly we can move from relying on God to relying on ourselves and it's way to easy to start trusting in a method because it worked in the past. Even worse is when we start living our lives a certain way just because 'that's what everybody else is doing'. Hearing from God for yourself is what gives you the edge, leaving Him out is what gets you into trouble. If you're the type of person who moves too quickly or tends to do things in your own strength, get praying. Ask God to let you know when you're moving on your own rather than with Him. It'll save you lots of  heartache!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE YOU WILL...ALWAYS BELIEVE IN HIM, ALWAYS EXPECT THE BEST OF HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 13:7 TLB</span><br>We humans are rubbish at seeing people for whom they could be. Most of the time we can't be bothered to look for what God sees in someone because all we see is faults! The problem is that the people you don't think much of probably have an amazing future awaiting them! In fact, if you knew their potential you'd keep your negative mouth shut and invest more time and energy into them. Remember Joseph? Don't make the mistake his brothers made. The person who completely does your head in today, could be the one you turn to for help tomorrow. So keep that in mind and treat them graciously!
The point is, looks can lie, we need to go deeper. Remember Ruth, the immigrant working for less than minimum wage? She became the wife of Boaz, who owned the fields she worked in! In the future it's highly likely you'll meet a Ruth-type person so treat her like Jesus would!  What about a more seasonal example? At the heart of the Christmas story is Mary, the mother of Jesus, looking for a place to spend the night and have her baby? It was the opportunity of a lifetime for a local inn-keeper to get in on the action and prepare the best room in the house to bring the saviour of the world into the world. But all except one left her and her unborn child out on the street.  Don't miss a God-moment just because it's a bit inconvenient! Take another look at the person you don't think you have the time for. Ask God today to help you see what He sees in them!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE REASON THE SON OF GOD APPEARED WAS TO DESTROY THE DEVIL'S WORK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:8 NIV</span><br>Happy Christmas! Today we celebrate Jesus being born in human flesh. Why did He come? 'To destroy the devil's work.' You're not expected to beat satan, Jesus already did that 2000 years ago. You're expected to put satan's defeat into action! Paul tells us in Colossians 2:15 that Jesus publicly embarrassed satan at the cross.
When the American General Douglas McArthur finally confronted the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces at the end of World War II, he stripped the glittering medals from the Commander's chest, took the sword out of his hand and as the world watched he declared total victory for the allies; and that's what Jesus did for you at the cross. When He died and rose again He stripped the devil of his power, removed his weapons and declared: 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me' (Matthew 28:18-19 NRS). 
So today is not just about a little baby wriggling in a straw-filled water trough. It's a day to recall the whole of that world-changing life and especially the fact that  'God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father' (Philippians 2:9-11 NIV). Through Jesus the battle against evil has been won. Now, for us, the power we need is in the name of Jesus and He has made that power available to you. So don't forget the point of today keep that in mind!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD DISCIPLINES THOSE HE LOVES'.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEB 12:6 NIV </span><br>Today is really a day of waiting isn't it. The big day is tomorrow and who knows what surprises it will bring; socks again from Auntie Mildred, yippee! But seriously, waiting isn't easy, patience seems to be one of the hardest 'fruits of the spirit' to grow (Galatians 5:22). But God's patience with us is amazing! Have you ever thought about how frustrating it must be to be God? He creates people and fills their life with potential only to watch them blow it over and over again, yet every time He picks us up and encourages us that we really can do it if we'll rely on His strength and not our own. 
Here's something we all need to know though, alongside God's patience is his discipline. The Bible says: 'Do not make light of the Lord's discipline. Do not lose heart when He rebukes you. The Lord disciplines those he loves' (Hebrews 12:6 NIV).  Don't expect to enjoy God's infinite patience if you treat Him with a 'you can't tell me what to do' attitude. If you're acting like that today, you need to deal with it sharpish before He deals with you! And when you do feel that heaviness inside that comes with God's discipline 'Do not lose heart'; don't go thinking God's rejected you just because He's pointed out something that needs sorting. It's the opposite, God correcting you is proof that you're His child and He loves you! Have you ever been told off by your favourite teacher or youth worker? It stings more from someone you like because their opinion really matters. Well remember that God's opinion matters even more!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE GIVES MORE GRACE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 4:6 NKJV</span><br>Ever noticed how your family can be the people you struggle most to have grace for? We're approaching Christmas, which is supposed to be a celebration. So we do we feel that our challenge between now and New Year is to just make it through alive? You have to endure the annual polite chat with the old person your parents claim you're related to, who may, if you're nice enough, leave you a wad of cash in the next few years. Then there's mum complaining 'it's her holiday too!'. We need loads of grace in Christmas; here are some more hints a) different viewpoints help you think things through. You may be arguing with someone because they're wrong but have you stopped to consider, just maybe they're right?  b) never resort to making it personal. Disagreeing is one thing, destroying somebody is another. Just because someone is driving you mad or even winning the argument, resorting to verbal abuse might feel natural but it's totally out of order. If you must fight, fight fair c) when you lose, take it on the chin. Instead of going on about it all the time, 'Help others with encouraging words; don't drag them down by finding fault' (Romans 14:14-19 TM) d) sometimes you just need to call it a day and walk away. When Paul and Barnabas argued over whether or not John Mark should travel with them, 'There followed a sharp disagreement between them' (Acts 15:39 AMP). End of story? No, just the beginning of two different ministries! So be gracious! What's happening to you right now may well be God's way of moving you into a new area of blessing.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET YOUR CONVERSATION BE GRACIOUS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 4:6 NLT</span><br>You can try your best to 'live at peace with everyone' (Romans 12:18 NIV), but even so:  
1) Conflicts and arguments will still happen. After all, life would be boring if we all ate the same food, wore the same clothes and watched the same channel. That's why there are so many ice cream flavours and styles of music! It's just as easy to be kind but firm or tactful and gracious as it is to be rude, critical and upset everyone. And that's especially true when you need to tell someone they did wrong. Paul says, 'If a Christian is overcome by...sin, you who are godly...humbly help him back onto the right path' (Galatians 6:1 TLB).  
2) Even Christians won't always agree. If you see the world in black and white it's hard to understand how two mature Christians can seem to have such different opinions on so many subjects. When there are so many opinions you can't agree with everyone, but that's ok. God is gracious and puts up with our silly arguments and even when we're wrong about stuff, he still loves and blesses us! Maybe real maturity is about loving those who are wrong - and choosing your battles carefully! 
3) Every point of view has a point. Growing up, most of us were taught that someone is right and someone is wrong and if you're right you get praised and if you're wrong you get told off. In reality it's often more like 'I-see-it-this-way-and-you-see-it-that-way'. So before you go letting people know who's right and who's wrong have a think; 'can I let somebody else be &quot;right&quot; sometimes, without backing down on what I believe?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF THEY HAD BEEN THINKING OF THE COUNTRY THEY HAD LEFT, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:15 NIV</span><br>Any pilot will tell you that there's a point of no return. When you reach the end of the runway there's nowhere to go but up. It's fly or die! In Hebrews 11 you'll see a list of totally normal people who did some mad and crazy things because even when they were going through the hardest times imaginable, they stuck to their vision. If you never look back, going back is not even an option. 
When you decide to follow God not everybody will be happy about it. Your vision could be their nightmare. Your success could prove all things they said about you wrong, or remind them of the vision they abandoned. Usually the hardest place to follow your vision is at home. There are always so many people keen to remind you of what you used to be like and they're often unwilling to believe you can change! 
In order for God to move us on, the first thing he does is to make us uncomfortable.  Until your faith factor is bigger than your fear factor you won't move! If you're at all comfortable, settled and content, don't expect God to give you more; you're not ready for it. When you start taking risks you'll pray like you've never prayed and stay as close to God as possible because it's all you've got. There's nothing like that sense of feeling frustrated and boxed-in to get your full attention on God. Bottom line: when you decide, 'I've come too far to turn back,' you'll start to see God's hand at work in your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 34:8 NIV</span><br>Imagine the world is a big ice cream truck with loads of different flavours of ice cream for sale, in lots of different brightly coloured wrappers. What tends to happen is people pick the one that looks the tastiest or the most colourful. God wants His people to reflect His character and glory so that humanity will be drawn to Him. Think about this; God invented all the colours and flavours in existence so we can conclude that He is in fact the tastiest option. Which must in turn mean that if we are carriers of His presence we too should be the most colourful, interesting, vibrant, tasty and happy bunch of people on the planet!  When Jesus was on earth He didn't have to beg people to hang out with Him. He was just Himself and people wanted to be where ever He was. Why? Because He was tasty; He left them feeling satisfied! Listen: 'Taste and see that the Lord is good' (Psalm 34:8). God is putting Himself out there to be sampled by who ever wants to try Him and He's chosen to do it through His people.  When you hang out with your mates do they get a taste of Gods goodness? Did you know that you have God's favour on your life? Yep, it's true. Your life has two massive God sized thumbs-up. So, are you representing His favour to others? Listen: If you're one of God's children then you are blessed with heaven's best; you have the favour flava!  He's done it so you can point others to Him but He also wants you to enjoy Him too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NOW FAITH IS BEING SURE OF WHAT WE HOPE FOR AND CERTAIN OF WHAT WE DO NOT SEE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:1 NIV</span><br>We can be way too impatient! If God doesn't speak to us in the first five minutes of our prayer time we get up, shrug it off and decide 'He isn't talking today.' We need to develop teeth like a bull terrier to take hold of God in prayer and refuse to let go until we've received a 'sure word' from Him? (2 Peter 1:19).
Listen: 'Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see'. There are two characteristics of faith; one is 'Sure' and the other is 'Certain'. So often people teach that faith is like jumping into a black hole but that's not actually true. Faith knows what God has said and because it is 'sure and certain' that He will do what He says, Faith helps us follows His directions even when we don't understand why He's leading us that way. How do we get faith? Well it tells us the answer in the Bible, 'Now faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God' (Romans 10:17 NKJ). It is vital that we spend time reading God's Word and listening to those who teach God's Word. Imagine that your faith is a muscle; the more you exercise that muscle the bigger and stronger it becomes. The more you listen to people talk about God and the more you read about Him for yourself, the stronger your faith will be when He asks you to follow Him. Even though you may not know where He is taking you, you'll be sure and certain that you can trust Him.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD IS WITH YOU, MIGHTY WARRIOR.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JUDGES 6:12 NIV</span><br>If you've felt attacked lately, get ready; God's about to show you what the fight is all about! The level of grief the devil is giving you says a lot about what God is building in you. Check out what the Bible says about Gideon (Judges 6): 'He was hiding from his enemies, threshing wheat in a wine press.' In other words; Gideon was freaked, busting up wheat in a wine shop! His fear had got the better of him and he was trying to do a job in the wrong place. So in God's true style He sends a big shiny dude to get Gideon's attention and tell him how it really is; the angel calls Gideon, &quot;Mighty warrior.'&quot; You see God recognises things in you that others don't; or even you don't! God sees you from start to finish.
Do you have an idea or a dream that you know could never happen without God? Good, that's what God meant when He said 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit' (Zechariah 4:6 NIV). Stop allowing other people to 'define you.' All you need is God's opinion. Nothing else matters. If He says you can do it, then you can. When God speaks to you He shows you what you've got, then helps you to use it. When Gideon said, 'I don't have what it takes,' the Lord replied, 'Go in the strength you have' (Judges 6:14), and 'I will be with you' (Judges 6:16). There's an important truth here: If you do what God asks, He'll help you and the results will blow your mind. Come on you Mighty Warrior!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ANYONE WITH EARS TO HEAR SHOULD LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 11:15 NLT</span><br>Hearing God is your top priority! Mary took the time to sit and listen to Jesus (Luke 10:39). You learn to hear from God by making time listen to Him! Fifteen times in the New Testament Jesus said: 'anyone with ears to hear should listen.' This tells you three important things: 
1) you were born into God's family with spiritual ears; even if you are deaf in the natural your spiritual ears can hear God speak to your spirit 
2) you have to use them - are your spiritual ears clogged up with worldy wax!   
3 hearing from God must become your top priority. A baby is born with the ability to hear, but doesn't understand. Understanding takes time; it requires intimacy with their parents. Get the idea? Luke writes: 'Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures' (Luke 24:45 NIV). Looking back over your life you realise that God has often talked to you, you just didn't understand what He was saying at the time, but later on you will. He's patient with you while you learn. 
Why does it seem easier to hear God's voice when you're having a rough time? It isn't, it's just that when things are tough, you're more keen to listen to him! Until that changes, you'll only go to Him in a storm and not hear what he's saying for your every day life. Jesus said, 'By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear' (John 5:30 NLT). Jesus only did what His Father in heaven told Him to do; He wants you to learn to live that way too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SEE TO IT THAT . . . NO BITTER ROOT GROWS UP TO CAUSE TROUBLE AND DEFILE MANY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:15 NIV</span><br>When someone upsets you, what's the first thing you do? Call your best mate and tell them what's just happened to you, not leaving out exactly what you think of the person who did it? But soon you'll say that you're over it and now you're moving on. Great! But what about the mate you unloaded on? Has your offence been passed over to them? Remember what you say will have an effect, whether for good or bad. Be careful what you say in the heat of the moment because it will shape the opinion of those who hear it. It's great when you can move from resenting others to forgiving them; but when you were angry did your words influence your mate's opinion of that person? James writes, 'My dear brothers and sisters...be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to get angry. Your anger cannot make things right in God's sight' (James 1:19-20 NLT). The writer to the Hebrews says: 'See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.' Thoughtless words really do leave lasting damage. Let that stop you in your tracks! Maybe you need to set the record straight with those you've left feeling gutted over a situation you now feel differently about. It's tough but you need to do it. Swallow your pride, go back and straighten things out, until you do you won't be on the right side of God. Jesus said, 'If you... remember a grudge a friend has against you...go to this friend and make things right' (Matt 5:23-24 MSG).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THOSE WHO WORK HARD WILL PROSPER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 13:4 NLT</span><br>Have you ever met a lazy person; their favourite phrase is, 'I can't be bothered' and their day is littered with excuse after excuse for why they haven't done what's been asked of them. Has that lazy bones you know sprung to mind or are you reading this and thinking that the lazy person is actually you? Did you know that laziness will take your life down a dead end road? Listen: 'Lazy people are soon poor; hard workers get rich' (Proverbs 10:4 NLT). If you're lazy then every area of your life will suffer; your relationship with your parents, your friendships and your future. If you have an 'I can't be bothered' approach to life then you will find yourself looking back and wondering what you have to show for your life, whilst others seem to be zooming ahead. Of course hanging with your mates seems more appealing than studying. But if you apply yourself and make an effort you'll be surprised how much it pays off later on. Don't let the fear of failure stop you from trying. If you do mess up, get back on your feet and show the devil that he'll never get the better of you. God isn't lazy! He is always watching out for you. Guess what? He never sleeps! Don't panic, it also says 'He gives sleep to those He loves' (Psalm 127:3 NIV), but His purpose for your life doesn't come wrapped in a duvet. He wants you to be like Paul who said, 'I press on towards the goal to win the prize' (Philippians 3:14 NIV). Don't let life pass you by, grab hold of it today!

Is your mind feeling stressed? Listen: 'God cares for you, so turn all your worries over to him' (1 Peter 5:7 NCV). How? Talk to Him; getting God involved is the best thing you can do to help yourself. If you're not sure what to say here's some words to help you get started: 
'Father, You told me not to be afraid 'cause You're with me, You've got my back, and those who have a go at me will have to deal with You too' (Isaiah 41:10-11). 'You said that if I hang out with you then you'll protect me from any nastiness the devil tries to throw at me. You've ordered Your angels to fight for me' (Psalm 91:10-11). 'You said when I'm in over my head You won't let me drown, and when the heat is on you won't let me get burnt 'cause You're watching out for me' (Isaiah 43:2-3). 'You said no weapon formed against me shall win' (Isaiah 54:17). 'I can't keep the enemy from trying, but I know that if I stick close to you he hasn't got a hope. You said if I ask anything You will, You'd do it' (1 John 5:14-15) 'and that if I do what You ask I will be blessed throughout my day and when I go to sleep at night' (Deuteronomy 28:6). 'You told me to give all my troubles to You and You would take care of me' (1 Peter 5:7). 'So here they are! Today I'm taking you at Your Word. You said it! I believe it! That settles it! Amen.'

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS...IS HOW YOU SHOULD PRAY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:9 NIV</span><br>Let's look at the prayer Jesus taught his disciples in Matthew 6:9-13. 
Every time you pray to your Father in Heaven it takes your friendship with Him to a deeper level. You're not only asking for God's input into your life but you're declaring your respect for Him. Because He really is your heavenly Dad you can have complete assurance that you are His. He's not just the Creator of the universe, He's your Father. You can create something and then not care much for it, but true fathers have an attachment of love to their child, forever. And there's more to this special prayer of Jesus... 
'Hallowed be your name' means He's not just your Father, He's your God. You can love Him and be loved by Him, but God is God and He deserves your respect.   'Your kingdom come,' releases God's power. 'Your will be done,' releases His purpose. 'Give us today our daily bread,' releases His provision. The things you lack and long for begin to flow into your life because now you've accessed His power, discovered His purpose for you and now you're walking in it. 'Forgive us our sins, as we also have forgiven those who sin against us' Means it is easier to forgive when you recall the things God has forgiven you for. Remembering God's goodness to you will give you the grace to forgive others, and even understand them! 'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one' means we enter each day prepared for battle, promised victory, and protected against all of the devil's attacks. That's why Jesus said, 'This...is how you should pray.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GUARD YOUR HEART, FOR IT IS THE WELLSPRING OF LIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 4:23 NLT</span><br>Yesterday you read about the role your heart plays in relation to the rest of your life. What ever is in your heart will affect the rest of you; your attitudes, emotions, desires and motivation. So how do you guard your heart from the things that can have a bad affect on it? Here are some helpful tips:  
1) When your mates start to talk about someone behind their back, don't join in. There is power in what you say, (James 3), so use your words for good instead of evil. 
2) Make it a habit to think about good things 'I will praise the Lord at all times; his praise is always on my lips' (Psalm 34:1 NCV). Singing songs to God gets our focus on Him and off ourselves. It also reminds us how great God is and how we shouldn't let little things get to us. If something or someone starts to bother you, start to thank God for how good He has been to you and you'll soon chill out and move on.  
3) Get to know His Word. When you read the Bible it shines a light on your path (Psalms 119:105) and helps lead you into good things rather than what is wrong. You will also get to know God's character so it will be easier to tell what things make Him happy and what doesn't. 
4) Talk to Him. If something is bothering you, let Him know and ask for His help to deal with it. 'Trust in him at all times... pour out your hearts to him' (Psalms 62:8 NIV) and His peace will 'guard your heart today' (Philippians 4: 7)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GUARD YOUR HEART, FOR IT IS THE WELLSPRING OF LIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 4:23 NLT</span><br>When you give your life to Jesus it says in the Bible that God gives you a new heart, 'I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them. I will take away their stony, stubborn heart and give them a tender, responsive heart' (Ezekiel 11:19 NLT). To understand what this means you need to know that the 'heart' talked about here isn't the ball of tissue and muscle that beats in your chest! God is talking about the centre of your attitude, emotion, desire and motivation; in old Hebrew thinking the 'heart' is all that, and more. Listen: 'Above all else, guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life' (Proverbs 4:23). Every aspect of your life flows from your heart. If you're jealous or angry it takes root in your heart; the core of who you are. It will influence everything that you choose to do. King Solomon refers to the heart as 'the wellspring of life'. A wellspring was the source of water for a community and if that well was poisoned the people who drew water from it would put their lives in danger. If you have allowed poison into your heart; the poison of jealousy, the poisonous words of gossip, then it will affect you whether you like it or not. How do you get rid of poison? Suck it out! How? Go to God and say sorry for letting that nasty stuff leak into your heart and then ask Him to make it clean again. Result! A fresh start, but don't fall for the same trap again. Remember to guard your heart!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>STOP JUDGING BY THE WAY THINGS LOOK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 7:24 NCV</span><br>When country singer Lonzo Green's nephew Jimmy asked him to tune a friend's guitar, he agreed. The problem was, Jimmy's friend was from the wrong part of town and Jimmy's parents wouldn't allow him inside their house. So they met outside. As the kid approached he looked self-consciousness due to the funny looks he was getting from folks in this better-off neighbourhood. Lonzo, who'd experienced poverty and discrimination in his own life, tuned the boy's old guitar, played a few songs and taught him some chords. The young man thanked him and left with a tuned guitar and warm memory. Eventually that boy used his guitar to get out of the wrong part of town and was never unwelcome again. That's because the boy who wasn't allowed in the house was...Elvis Presley, a music legend who shifted over 100 million records!  
Jesus said, 'Look beneath the surface so you can judge correctly.' Jesus personally experienced the pain of rejection; even His 'own people...didn't want him' (John 1:11 TM). James later comments, 'how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favour some people over others? For example, suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewellery, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty clothes. If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, &quot;You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor&quot; well, doesn't this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives?' (James 2:1-4 NLT). 
So, what do you think when you meet people who aren't just like you? ]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[More mountaintop experiences]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL NOT...SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT CHRIST HAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 15:18 NIV</span><br>One day Jesus took some of His disciples to the top of a mountain. At the top something amazing happened to Him: 'His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus' (Matthew 17:2-3 NIV). Peter was so blitzed by the experience that he thought they should stay there: 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters - one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah' (Matthew 17:4 NIV). But Jesus said 'No,' and led them back down the mountain. At the bottom a crowd had gathered and immediately Jesus had to get stuck back to His miraculous work. It's good to have mountaintop experiences with God; but you can't stay there. There's work to be done! 
The Old Testament gives us similar pictures. The High Priest went into the 'Holy of Holies' once a year where he had the privilege of seeing the glory of the Lord, but God's work was done outside amongst the people! Amazing stuff also happened to Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1-4). He was carried to God's presence in sort of virtual-reality, but afterwards he had to go out and get on with the job God gave him. There's a balance. We must spend quality time with God, then 'come back down to earth' with the answers needed by those around us. 
Getting the idea? Well what better day than today to put this into practice. Make sure you set aside time for you and God and then come down from the mountain and get to work!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE REVELATION AWAITS AN APPOINTED TIME... WAIT FOR IT;  IT WILL CERTAINLY COME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 2:3 NIV</span><br>God isn't random! Everything He does is deliberate. One way of understanding this aspect of God is to think about a diary full of appointments. The diary is to make sure that everything gets done on time and in the right order. And God has set times for things to happen in your life. You can count on that! 
Problems start happening when we try to rush God's timing. When God gives you a promise it's like a seed; it needs time to take root and bear fruit. Human life follows a similar cycle doesn't it? Everyone knows the order; mum and dad have sex (yes, even yours!), then the pregnancy, then the development in the womb, and finally the day of the birth. And what does mum-to-be do during this time? Prepare! She gets ready for parenthood because it won't be long before that little life announces, 'Ready or not, here I come!' The Psalmist writes: 'Don't be impatient for the Lord to act! Keep travelling steadily along his pathway and in due season he will honour you with every blessing' (Psalm 37:34 TLB).
Maturity is about learning the difference between human timing and God's timing. Is that a lesson you still need to learn? If you learn it now it will set you up for life. If you don't want to risk delaying God's plan for your life, learn to sit tight listening carefully for His 'Now' word. The prophet said, '...the revelation awaits an appointed time... wait for it;  it will certainly come...' So, whenever you get impatient, remind yourself, God said it and He will make it happen in His time!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...STRUGGLING WITH ALL HIS ENERGY, WHICH SO POWERFULLY WORKS IN ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:29 NIV</span><br>Do you want God's best for your life? Well, the easy path won't get you there, only the path of sacrifice will. It's not easy being the one putting the effort in when people around you are being lazy and making excuses. Like Jesus, in that long night of painful prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, you may not have reliable people around you in your time of testing. 
Remember this little saying: There can be no celebration without preparation! You probably know people who've already given up on making a success of their life because they can't take the pressure. You can probably think of some examples of people who wanted success but couldn't handle it when it arrived. Hopefully you're different.  You're the kind of person who isn't satisfied sitting on the sidelines; you're gonna go for it! Listen: if you have the passion, the price won't stop you. 
Some days you'll have tears in your eyes and dirt under your fingernails, but in spite of the scrapes and bruises, that holy passion will make you want to sing at midnight like Paul and Silas ( Acts 16:16-34), and give you a sense of mission that makes you cry out like Isaiah, 'Here am I, send me' (Isaiah 6:8 NIV). So if today is tough remember this blindingly obvious bit of wisdom: there's never been a day that lasted forever! Don't give up and don't give in. Bite your lip, wipe away your tears and stand on what God has promised you. And remember, you don't need to depend on your own strength, you have: '...all His energy, which so powerfully works in me.'

<title><![CDATA[The meaning of life ]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY LAY THEIR CROWNS BEFORE THE THRONE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 4:10 NIV</span><br>A lot of people race from one thing to another and never stick at anything. Living like this life is full of experiences but empty of meaning. The 'meaning' of life isn't revealed all of a sudden by trying lots of things until you find that one thing that contains the 'AHA' moment. Meaning is found bit by bit as we walk with God paying attention to the things he's telling us, especially in his Word, the Bible. There will never be anything that can replace the importance of God in your life. If you think you can find satisfaction just by doing lots of exciting stuff, think again! No matter what memories you create for yourself they all fade away over time. The only thing that will get better over time, if you are willing to give it time, is your relationship with God. 
Check this out: 'The twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him...They lay their crowns before the throne and say: &quot;You are worthy, our Lord and God&quot;' (Revelation 4:10-11 NIV). Did you see that? In this heavenly picture the elders not only worshipped God, they laid their crowns at His feet. What are those crowns? Well it's quite likely that  they're a symbol of the things achieved in this life, things that become worthless before the throne of Almighty God. Sometimes we just need to lay it all down, look up and say, 'Lord, I need to spend time with You!' Truth is, your achievements may bring you some happiness, but only in God's presence will you find 'fullness of joy' (Psalm 16:11 NAS).

<title><![CDATA[Through the storms!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE WEATHER CHANGED ABRUPTLY, AND A WIND OF TYPHOON STRENGTH... BLEW US OUT TO SEA</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 27:14 NLT</span><br>Paul travelled a lot and so he knew that at any time the conditions might change for the worse. And it wasn't just the weather he had to watch out for, people's attitudes towards him changed too. Even some of his closest friends walked out on him (2 Timothy 4:9-12). So what lessons can we learn from this? 
1) Life involves storms, but they do pass. 'When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved' (Acts 27:20 NIV). There will be days when you'll wonder how you're going to make it but by God's grace you will! 
2) Storms show how well you know God. 'Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me and said, &quot;Do not be afraid, Paul,&quot;' (Acts 27:23-24 NIV). It's the tough times that reveal the strength of your God-connection. 
3) True leaders stand out in an emergency. In this story the ship's crew had to throw stuff overboard, then in an attempt to get to dry land they got stuck. Paul stood up and spoke words of faith that enabled everyone to carry on. 
4) Often the worst thing that could have happened turns out for the best. God used this shipwreck to reach the island of Malta with the Gospel. Notice what happened to Paul as he left the island: 'when the time came to sail, people supplied us with everything we would need for the trip (Acts 28:10 NLT). Stop worrying, God will provide what you need; you're His child and you will get through the storms!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'JESUS I KNOW, AND PAUL I KNOW...BUT WHO ARE YOU?'  </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 19:15 NIV</span><br>We're gonna spend just one more day on this intriguing incident: 
6) Don't bother using the name of Jesus unless you have made Him Lord. Paul knew about Jesus, he met Him face-to-face on the dusty Damascus Road and his life was revolutionized. And the same will happen when you make Jesus the Lord of your life; no, not just your mate, your boss! Then you can use His name in all its true power. 
7) Why settle for anything less than a direct relationship with Him? These guys said, to the spirit, 'Come out in the name of that same Jesus that Paul preaches about!' (Acts 19:13 CEV) Er, aren't you giving the game away there guys? You don't know this Jesus at all do you? No wonder they took such a beating! If these guys had just stopped for a minute to consider that Paul's ability to heal and deliver people was not found in his own special power but through his relationship with the One 'who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand-with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him' (1 Peter 3:22 NIV). Have you got that direct relationship with Him? If not you can enter into it right here and right now. Jesus is only a prayer away. You don't need to say any fancy words, you just need to be honest about the fact that you've been going your own way. Then you need to tell Him that you want today to be a U-turn day when you're going to stop following your own feelings and start following Him. You can look in the back cover of this devotional for some more help to get you connected  :-)  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'JESUS I KNOW, AND PAUL I KNOW...BUT WHO ARE YOU?' </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 19:15 NIV</span><br>Today we're going to squeeze a bit more out of the story we started on Saturday. 
4) When the 'evil day' comes there's no pretending! (Ephesians 6:13). The evil spirit in this tormented man exposed the weakness in the seven religious brothers. In a demonic freak-out he took them all on them and before they knew what'd hit them they were running out of the house naked, stripped of their pretence. Don't try this at home unless you know you've got the real thing! Are you ready to drop your wisecracks to simply stand on His Word? Have you been through the time of testing when you follow Jesus even when you can't understand or explain where He's taking you? It's better to be honest about where you're at than to get yourself in over your head.  
5) Demons don't have a database! The evil spirit in this man spoke out: 'Jesus I know, and Paul I know...but who are you?' Satan isn't all-knowing like God. Yes, he has his evil agents stalking around here and there generally causing mayhem but they can't keep up with the advance of God's Kingdom. Plus, even if the demons of Ephesus had a hit-list these guys wouldn't have been on it, they were no threat to the Kingdom of Darkness, but are you? Maybe you're still dealing with your own lack of confidence saying, 'I can't do anything, I'm rubbish.' Listen: It's not you the enemy is afraid of, it's the Spirit of God that's in you! 'Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world' (1 John 4:4).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS I KNOW, AND PAUL I KNOW...BUT WHO ARE YOU?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 19:15 NIV</span><br>So what else can we learn from the scrap we read about yesterday involving the sons of this Jewish priest guy? 
1) Success is not as easy as it looks! These men showed up later on in Paul's ministry. They weren't there in the beginning when he was blinded by an encounter with the risen Jesus on a dusty out-of-town road. They were looking for shortcuts that just aren't there! When you see someone else doing great things it can really get you fired up to want to do it too. However, only a short-sighted person expects to achieve overnight what it took years of experience to bring them into. 
2) Big numbers don't necessarily mean big results! These seven men together couldn't do what one Spirit-empowered Jesus-follower did. Yes, their dad was one of the top priests, so they knew plenty about 'religion', but they were a classic case of: 'Having a form of godliness, but denying its power' (2 Timothy 3:5 NIV). 
3) Those around you are not always with you! Just because somebody hangs out with you, paying you compliments and bigging you up doesn't mean they're to be trusted. These men followed Paul not because they wanted to make Jesus famous but because they wanted to make themselves famous. They had the wrong heart motive! John writes: 'These people came from our own group, yet they were not part of us. If they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us.' (1 John 2:19 CEV). When God removes someone from your life because they don't belong, trust Him, He knows what's best!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'JESUS I KNOW, AND PAUL I KNOW...BUT WHO ARE YOU?' </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 19:15 NIV</span><br>Do you ever watch those TV programmes where people do mad things - things you might be tempted to try to do? There's always a caption on the screen that says 'don't try this at home.' With that in mind we're going to spend the next few days looking a story from the book of Acts. The first thing we need to note is that at this time Paul was on a roll: 'God did extraordinary miracles through Paul...handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.' (Acts 19:11-12 NIV) The next thing we read is that other religious people saw what he was doing and decided that they'd have a go at casting out a few demons themselves. We'll pick up the story in verse 14: 'Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this: the evil spirit answered them, &quot;Jesus I know and Paul I know...but who are you?&quot; Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and...gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding' (Acts 19:11-16 NIV). It's a pretty gruesome scene isn't it! 
So what's the message to us? Should we play it safe and live a risk-free Christian life or just jump into every scrap hoping that we'll come out on top?  Well, the key thing was that Paul was doing the specific job God had given him to do. These other copycats weren't. You see, God doesn't empower you to do your own thing, He empowers you to do His thing; which is the only thing that matters.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Each part...helps the other parts grow.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:16 NLT</span><br>Next time you're walking in the woods, imagine what's taking place under your feet. As the roots of trees come into contact with one another they form an underground support system. One tree has better access to water, another to nutrients, another to sunlight. A networking is taking place that strengthens them all. This is what Paul had in mind when he writes to the Ephesians: '[Under His direction], the whole body is fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.' 
Find it hard to &quot;network&quot; with others? Here are three things that you can work on:  
1) Forgiveness. 'Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others' (Colossians 3:13 NLT). Why show mercy to others? God's mercy to us. You'll never be asked to forgive someone else more than God has already forgiven you 
2) Understanding. 'Be sympathetic ...kind...gentle, and patient' (Colossians 3:12 GWT). Sympathy meets two basic human needs we all have: the need to be understood and the need to have our feelings recognized as important. Sometimes we're too caught up with our own hurts, self-pity dries up sympathy for others. Oh yeah,  don't let yourself say 'where were they when I needed sympathy it doesn't matter,  remember point number 1!  
3) Encouragement. 'I want us to help each other with the faith we have. Your faith will help me, and my faith will help you' (Romans 1:12 NCV). All of us are strengthened in our faith when others walk with us and encourage us. So today, be a networker!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We have...an eternal house in heaven.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 5:1 NIV</span><br>The author Alice Gray writes, 'Laurel knew she was dying. Over the weeks we often talked about heaven. The hardest part was trying to image something we had never seen. Then I remembered a story about a girl who'd been blind since birth. When she was twelve the doctors were able to perform a new type of surgery that would give her sight. But the outcome wouldn't be known for several days. After the bandages were removed from her eyes they had to be protected from the light. So she sat in darkness, waiting. The mother spent long hours answering her daughter's questions about what things looked like and what she should expect. Finally the moment came when the child's eyes could endure enough light for her to look out the window. She stood there for a long time without saying a word. Outside, the spring day was ideal, with fluffy white clouds decorating a blue sky. Blossoms sprinkled to the ground like pink snow as soft breezes bared the cherry trees. Yellow crocuses proudly lined the brick walkway that wound across the grass. When the girl turned back to her mother, tears were streaming down her cheeks. &quot;Mum, why didn't you tell me it would be so beautiful?&quot; I shared this story with my friend, tears filling my own eyes. &quot;Laurel, right now we're sitting in the darkness, but before long you will be asking God the same question.&quot;'
Heaven is more amazing than any place you've ever been. When you get there you'll meet Jesus face to face and if you want you can ask, 'Why didn't you tell me it would be so beautiful?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Trouble will not come a second time.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Nahum 1:9 NIV</span><br>Are you afraid your old problems are going to come back again? You told other people how God answered your prayer, but now the enemy's trying to get back at you using a 'spirit of fear' (2 Timothy 1:7). Sometimes satan will try to bring back old issues; an old habit, attitude or problem.  Just by getting you thinking about them, soon you begin to worry about them, and end up living like someone who is trapped not someone who is free. When satan counterattacks it often comes through your imagination. Before you know it, what you imagined yesterday you begin to believe today, and become fully convinced of tomorrow. That's why the Bible instructs us to, 'Cast down imaginations and take every thought captive' (2 Corinthians 10:5). Take control of your thoughts before they take control of you! When your thoughts are flooded with fear we have to DECIDE to trust God; even when we don't feel up for it.
The Psalmist understood fear: 'In my anguish I cried to the Lord, and He answered by setting me free. The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid. I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the Lord has done' (Psalm 118:5-6, 17 NIV). The prophet Habakkuk experienced it too: 'I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound...yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Saviour. The sovereign Lord is my strength' (Habakkuk 3:16, 18-19 NIV). Rejoice, God says, 'It's over.' 'Trouble will not come a second time.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>For everything, absolutely everything...finds its purpose in Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 1:16 TM</span><br>You might have heard your art teacher banging on about Michelangelo, one of the greatest sculptors in history. Yet although he worked on many statues, he only completed a few of them. The unfinished ones are in museums; the unfilled potential of a great genius. Want to make sure you reach your potential?  
1) Look up! 'It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for (Ephesians 1:11 TM). You can't arrive at your life's purpose by starting with yourself. Talk to the Lord! 
2) Give up! You've got to be willing to sacrifice what you are in order to become what God wants you to be. Moses gave up the riches of Egypt to identify with a nation of slaves. Paul gave up the prestige of being a Pharisee to pay the price of being an apostle. Every achiever has a 'give up' story; nothing comes free. 
3) Show up! To win you must play the game. You can't sit on the sidelines. You were put on this earth to make a difference. You weren't created just to consume resources - to eat, breathe and take up space. What God told Jeremiah is true of you: 'Before I made you in your mother's womb, I chose you. Before you were born, I set you apart for a special work' (Jeremiah 1:5 NCV). Find your God-given assignment and pour life into it. 'David had served God's purpose in his own generation' (Acts 13:36 NIV). Imagine that chiselled on your tombstone: that you spent your life doing what God wanted you to do. It doesn't get any better!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 27:5</span><br>When trouble comes, do these three things: 
1) Get alone with God! David writes, 'In the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion.'  This doesn't mean hiding with bunch of cricket players!  David was a King and the secret place in a king's palace was called a 'pavilion.' There you were protected from the enemy. All hell could break loose around you but it didn't matter, in the secret place there was peace. God has got your back, Get alone with Him and you can get the peace of the pavilion!  
2) You're not too big to ask for help! Some people won't ask for help because they don't want to look weak. The Bible says those of us who are strong ought to bear the burdens of the weak. There are times when we need to do the lifting; and times when we ourselves need to be lifted. Sometimes you need help because you can't help yourself. King David understood this so he turned to the men of Issachar because they 'had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do' (1 Chronicles 12:32 NKJV). God has provides us with people to help, reach for it! 
3) Learn to listen to the Holy Spirit for He will constantly remind you of God's plan and show you how to carry it out. Jesus said, 'The Holy Spirit...will teach you all things, and remind you of everything I have said to you' (John 14:26 NIV). What has the Lord said to you? Have you done it? Obedience is your doorway out of trouble. (See Psalm 143:10).

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN EVERYTHING SET THEM AN EXAMPLE BY DOING WHAT IS GOOD</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>TITUS 2:7 NIV</span><br>Millions of young people all over the world dream of playing sport for their country. Maybe you've pictured yourself in the changing room before a big game. You pull on your kit, proud to be one of the few chosen to wear your nation's colours, to represent your country. As you step out onto the pitch, track or court you're hit with an explosion of colour and noise as your home crowd cheers you on. Then the game starts, and millions of eyes start to WATCH! 
Just like playing for your country, it's a massive honour to be picked by God to be on His team. 'You are the ones chosen by God' (1 Peter 2:9 MSG). But also like when you play for your country, you've got lots of people watching you. Anyone who knows you, knows you're a Christian. They know you're wearing God's kit and colours and want to know what you play like.
In the Bible, when Jesus picked the twelve guys would form His 'dream team' He didn't give them an interview first followed by a contract to sign, He simply said 'follow me'. He wanted them to hang out with Him and be in His crew but He also wanted them to be LIKE HIM. To do what He did, to follow His example. 
With people at school, home and youth group all watching you, it's important to set them an example in doing good. They notice when you foul or cheat! Each day pray that you will play like Jesus, and set an example by following His example.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Adam and his wife had another son. They named him Seth, because they said, &quot;God has given...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 4:25 CEV</span><br>In one sweep of jealousy, Eve's dreams lay bleeding on the ground; her older son was now a criminal on the run, her younger son murdered in the prime of life. Destined to be the mother of the human race, now all she has is a corpse and a killer. Maybe you know that sort of feeling... when it looks like everything has gone pear-shaped? Have you been saying: 'God, this is not what You promised!' If that's where you are today God will make a way! Look what He did for His people in the wilderness: 'He led them straight to safety (Psalm 107:7 NLT). Everything in your life may seem to be falling apart, and it can sometimes feel impossible but God knows what He's doing!
When Cain killed his brother Abel God's plan for Eve was delayed but not destroyed. And in spite of what you're going through right now, everything God has promised you will be fulfilled: 'Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion' (Philippians 1:6 NIV). God has a way of restoring things you thought were written off. He moved in Eve's life and gave her another son called Seth. Eve began to realise that if God says it, He will do it. Satan may try to put up roadblocks but he can't prevent it from happening. Things may not come in the way you thought they should or through the person you thought but if God said it He'll make a way!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let everyone see that you are unselfish.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:4 TLB</span><br>A young American nurse tells of a patient called Eileen. Brain damage had left her with no control over her body. The doctors thought she was totally unconscious, unable to feel pain, unaware of anything going on around her. It was the hospital staff's job to turn her every hour to prevent bedsores, and to feed her twice a day through a stomach tube. 'When it's this bad,' an older nurse told her, 'you have to detach yourself emotionally.' As a result Eileen came to be treated as a thing, a vegetable. But one young student nurse decided to treat her differently. She talked to Eileen, sang to her, and even brought her little gifts. One Thanksgiving Day she said to Eileen, 'It was supposed to be my day off, but I couldn't miss seeing you on Thanksgiving.' Just then the telephone rang. As the nurse turned to answer it she looked quickly back at the patient: 'Eileen was looking at me...crying. Big damp circles stained her pillow.' That was the only human emotion Eileen ever showed. But it was enough to change the attitude of the entire hospital staff toward her. Not long afterward Eileen died. The young nurse closes her story by saying 'I keep thinking about her...I owe her an awful lot. Except for Eileen I might never have known what it's like to give myself to someone who can't give back.'
Love, God's love, means giving to those who seem to have little or nothing to give back. It challenges the selfishness in us and goes against our grain. But it's love in its highest form!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He who walks with wise men will be wise.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 13:20 NKJV</span><br>Ever met someone who fires you up to be the person God wants you to be!  When you find them, spend time with them. In the Bible, Elisha spent many years living in Elijah's shadow. But he saw it as a privilege, not a put-down. He was willing to set up tents, cook meals, wash clothes and run errands because it meant was there to see first-hand some of the greatest miracles in history. Later Elisha said to Elijah, 'I want a double portion of the spirit that's at work in you' (2 Kings 2:9), and before his life was over Elisha worked twice as many miracles as Elijah. 
Seeing God bless someone else should challenge you to reach higher. This isn't envy; just a strong desire to receive more.  Check out 1 Samuel 1 and look at Hannah, the wife of this guy called Elkanah. She desperately wanted a child. It didn't help that her husband has another wife (they had different laws in those days!) who, unlike Hannah, was able to have kids. The more Hannah saw Peninnah have children the more she wanted her own. Plus Peninnah was a real cow about it as well. But in response Hannah prayed. That's the right response! It wasn't that Hannah was jealous and didn't want to see Peninnah have children, it was just that she wanted her own. If seeing others succeed makes you want to sabotage their success, you've missed the point. Learn how to buzz over the blessings of others, and realise that the same God who blessed them can bless you too. Let their blessings challenge you to reach higher!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Live under the protection of God most high and stay in the shadow of God All-Powerful.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 91:1 CEV</span><br>Why would the prodigal son walk out on his dad when he already had everything he needed? Because: 
1) He got used to the good stuff his dad did and took it for granted. That's why God told His people, 'Be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you...out of...slavery' (Deuteronomy 6:12 NIV). At one point God told His people to take 12 stones, one for each tribe, and build a memorial. It might have looked like just a pile of stones but there was a reason it stood there year after year; to remind them of who they were, whom He was, and the promises that bound them together. What could YOU do to help you remember?  
2) He didn't know what was 'out there.' The path that takes us away from God leads to pain, not gain. Ask those who've walked it. They'll say, 'don't go there'  
3) He wanted his father's blessings but not his rules. He didn't like his dad telling him what to do. Sound familiar? Jesus said: 'Why do you call me, &quot;Lord&quot;...and do not do what I say?' (Luke 6:46 NIV). 
Sometimes we can be so sure of what we want that we ditch God, determined that we know best. You can imagine the prodigal son, storming out of his dad's house saying - 'I'll show you, you just wait and see.'  Then we mess up and have to find the guts to fess up. One of the hardest places to be is knowing you were wrong. The Bible says the prodigal 'came to his senses' and knew he should head home; do you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE DILIGENT...SO THAT EVERYONE MAY SEE YOUR PROGRESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:15 NIV</span><br>A well-known Bible teacher tells of a pilot who received word from the control tower saying, 'You're cleared for 5,000 feet.' When he got there he had to hold for further instructions. Next came the words, 'You're cleared for 10,000 feet.' Gradually the controller took him level by level to 35,000 feet where he was cleared to fly to his destination. God spoke to this Bible teacher and said, 'I wish you would trust me like that. Instead you want to go straight to 35,000 feet in one thrust!' Listen: God sees the end from the beginning and He has already mapped out your journey. He knows that if you rise too quickly there are dangers. You may be in the cockpit, but God's in the control tower. His Word to you today is: 'Trust me and I'll get you safely to your destination.' God's plan for your life can't be rushed. When you try to move too quickly you end up in a tug-of-war with Him, and you'll lose every time! 
Before God could trust King David to lead the nation He first had to see if he could look after his dad's sheep. It was here David built a relationship with God and developed the qualities that would get him through the tough times ahead when he was king. God will let you practice in a place where your weaknesses can be worked on, your gifts developed, and where your mistakes won't affect too many others. That's because He cares for them too! If God has put you on hold today, it's because He loves you and wants only what's best for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ENVY CAN EAT YOU UP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 14:30 CEV</span><br>The most miserable people in life are those filled with envy. It eats away their soul and steals their joy. They think of nothing except the thing somebody else has that they want. Does this describe you? Well, how would you answer the following questions: 'Is it hard for me to compliment other people?' 'Am I always defensive? 'When somebody's name comes up in conversation do I find myself feeling good because something bad has happened to them?' Come on, be honest! When you hear something complimentary about someone do you feel the need to say 'yeah, but...' then point out their weaknesses? Do you diss people who've achieved more than you? Do you privately compare yourself to them? Are you preoccupied with what other people are doing, buying, wearing, and who they get to hang out with? Do you trust the people you love, or are you always checking up on them? King Solomon said: 'Envy can eat you up.' So if you're envious and you want to change: a) drop the mask and admit you've got a problem b) apologise to God and ask for His help c) pray for the person you're jealous of. At first it'll feel awkward, but as you keep doing it God will change your heart and replace envy with love. Begin to celebrate other people's successes, and make a point of complimenting them. Remember, nobody's as good at being you as you, so you've no competition. When you're secure in who you are before God, you don't have to be jealous of anybody. You'll start to appreciate your uniqueness and the role He's given you to fill in His kingdom.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU ARE GOD'S MASTERPIECE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:10</span><br>Girls love diamonds. It's a fact! Nearly every girl alive would love to get a diamond from someone she loves...not every girl would admit that, but secretly she thinks it. If a girl gets bought a diamond engagement ring she admires it and each time she looks at it she is reminded of her fiancé and their love for one another.  Did you know that you're precious to God? Like the diamond is admired by the newly engaged girl, God admires you. He thinks you are beautiful. Yes, that includes the fellas too! It says in the Bible that, 'you are God's masterpiece' (Ephesians 2:10). If you go to an art gallery and look at a Van Gogh or a Rembrandt, what ever your opinion of the picture is, you won't be able to deny that the one who painted it was the master of his craft. You may look in the mirror and think your nose could do with shrinking. You may wish you we're taller, smaller or had thicker hair. You are your own worst critic. Next time you look at yourself, what ever your opinion might be right now; know this, you were created by the one who is the ultimate designer, the Master of His Craft, and He is captivated by you! You're a masterpiece; an expression of your heavenly Father's heart. He has given you the ability to love, to create, to invent, to express and to be yourself. No one else can contribute to this world in the way that you can. There is no other like you. So next time you go to diss yourself, try to see beyond the flaws and see the masterpiece.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 2:11</span><br>What is salvation? Well, if you were drowning and you couldn't keep your head above water for a second longer and just as you took your last breath someone reached into the water and pulled you to safety, you'd say that person had saved your life. At that moment, they were your salvation. If you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Saviour, you've not only been saved from an eternity without God but you've been given the inheritance of Jesus Christ himself. Here are a few things you can expect if you take the hand of Jesus and let him be your Saviour: 
1) 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness' (2 Peter 1:3 NIV). You have all you need today because you're God's child. If you don't think so, ask God for what you need, it's yours in Jesus. 
2) 'Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ' (Ephesians 1:3 NIV) Everything that Jesus is, you have access to! He is the healer so you can access healing; He is the champion so you can live in victory...the list goes on. 
3) 'We are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago' (Eph 2:10 NLT). God has a plan a purpose for your life. He didn't just save you so you can share heaven with Him. He saved you so you can live your life to the max, loving God and sharing His life with others. Don't waste a minute!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AFTER THEY HAD PRAYED, THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE MEETING WAS SHAKEN. AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 4:31 NIV</span><br>Do you feel like you're having a hard time today? If so, notice four things that God told Jesus' followers to do when they were getting agro from the people who were against them:
1 ) They got God involved. 'Lord, listen to their threats.' (Acts 4:29 NCV). Have you talked to God about it yet? If it's not big enough to be a prayer it's too small to be a problem! God should be the first person you discuss your problems with, not the last. Praying is like opening the door of your life to God and giving Him full access into your situation; but you have to invite Him in.
2) They prayed for more faith. 'Lord...help us to speak your word without fear' (Acts 4:29). Fear always tries to poke its ugly nose into our business, trying to make us worry and doubt. If you want to kick fear's butt, you must starve it, ignore it and feed your faith instead (Romans 10:17). 
3) 'Stretch out your hand' (Acts 4:30 NIV). They expected God to step in and help. The disciples had been through a terrible storm with Jesus so they knew what He could do: 'About three o'clock in the morning Jesus came to them, walking on the water' (Matt 14:25 NLT). And He still works the nightshift. He's available 24/7; all you need to do is talk to Him! 
4) They were all filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:31). There's the key; they stayed energized and directed by the Spirit of God. And you must too. It's okay to use your gifts, as long as you fully rely on God!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:7 NIV</span><br>The Bible says 130 years after Adam first sinned, he had a son who was 'just like him' (Genesis 5:3 NIV). As Adam's descendants, we have all been born with a human nature that sins without even trying. Sometimes people say, 'He's just like his dad,' or we say, 'My dad had a nasty temper, now I've got his temper!' 'My dad couldn't stay with my Mum; I bet I end up divorced too.' 'My dad was an alcoholic, now look how much I drink!' 'My dad didn't show love to me, now I don't know how to show love to others.' History repeats itself over and over through our sinning nature. 
Here's an interesting example: 'Abraham said of his wife Sarah, &quot;She is my sister.&quot;' (Gen 20:2 NIV). This is a bizarre moment in Abraham's life when he was willing to give away his wife to save his own skin. What would you've done? Before you answer, remember that Isaac wasn't even born when his father did this. Yet years later he did exactly the same thing in the same place (Gen 26:7). It's genetic! It's in our DNA.
But there is good news; when you give your life to Jesus He breaks that cycle! When you're 'born of the Spirit' you get a new heavenly Father and a new heavenly nature (John 3:3-6). You don't have to give in to basic human cravings any more; making the same mistakes he has over and over again. Instead you can walk like your heavenly Father and become more like Him every day. 
Fed up with your old nature and ways? Look to Jesus!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SHARE EACH OTHER'S TROUBLES AND PROBLEMS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:2 NLT</span><br>Everyone is hiding something, and it's not because they're deceptive, it's just that some wounds are too private. When someone in your family is being insensitive and uncaring the pain can be too deep to talk about. When your friend wounds you with acid words you sting inside but you can't show it. So you say hurtful things back and forth till you both retreat to lick your wounds. Is that where you are today, struggling with something too painful to talk about? Listen, other people are too! Their anger is a symptom. Sarcastic words hide their fear of being rejected because they've been hurt before. Jesus saw the best in the worst of people and went out of His way to be kind and patient towards them. Do you remember how He treated the woman caught 'in the sack' with another women's husband (John 8). When every one else was after blood, Jesus saw someone worth saving, loved her, lifted her and gave her the strength to do better. You're asked to do that too!
So remind yourself today that other people are going through things you don't know about; crying tears you don't see and feeling alone in ways you can't imagine. Next time someone is harsh to you don't react in anger, take a deep breath, and respond with words that will bring peace to the situation! You might be the only one who is kind to them today. When you are it will help lift their burden! 'Share each other's troubles and problems' if you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself' (Galatians 6:2-3 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY WENT TO THEIR OWN GROUP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 4:23</span><br>Sometimes doing what God wants can make you popular, other times it can get you into trouble; especially with those who like 'keeping things the way they are.' In Acts, Chapter 3, Peter and John were used by God to bring healing to a man who'd been unable to walk for 38 years. Then we read, 'He went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God' (Acts 3:8 NIV). Around that time thousands of people were choosing to follow Jesus, and the religious authorities were really angry. They threatened the disciples, ordering them not to mention the name of Jesus in their preaching. So the disciples held a prayer meeting saying, 'Help us...to speak your word without fear' (Acts 4:29 NCV).
Now pay special attention to verse 23, 'they went to their own group.' Where did they go? Back to those who were 'filled with the Holy Spirit '(Acts 4:31); to those who were 'of one heart and one soul' (Acts 4:32); to those who were so committed to reaching the world for Christ that they sold all they had and invested it into God's work (Acts 4:32). That's the kind of company you need to be in! Who do you go to for support and encouragement? It's been said that your company determines your conduct; your conduct determines your character and your character can affect the choices you make, which will affect your destiny. So ask God to lead you into 'the right company.' It's important to hang out with people who are a good influence on you. When you find them you'll wonder how you ever made it without them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CLEANSE ME FROM MY SIN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:2 NIV</span><br>If God never kicked off about people doing bad stuff how could you believe He rewards people for doing good stuff? Look at King David; he let his passions run away with him and then covered it up. For a while he thought he was OK but he didn't get away with it for long. There are always consequences! The truth is David did something that took him down a path that wasn't mapped out by God, lost his way, lost his sense of closeness with God, lost his peace of mind, and lost the respect of others. 
David's sin dragged his own name through the mud, caused pain to Bathsheba and death to her husband, but first and foremost David's sin was against God. Listen to David's prayer: 'Remove the stain of my guilt. Create in me a clean heart, O God...make me willing to obey you' (Psalm 51:9-12 NLT). Is God highlighting an area of disobedience in your life? Get it right with Him today and you will feel so much better! Your obedience to God frees you, because He only puts boundaries in place to protect you. Like a fireguard stops a baby reaching into the fire and getting burnt God sets guards in your life so you don't get unnecessarily hurt. When David finally said sorry to God, Nathan the prophet said, 'The Lord has taken away your sin' (2 Sam 12:13 NIV). God's forgiveness is awesome. He not only takes away the stain of our mistake but it says that He chooses to forget that we ever sinned in the first place, 'I will forget the wrongs you have done' (Isaiah 43: 25 CEV). He gives you a clean slate!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:15 NLT</span><br>A lot of us grew up idolising superheroes. Batman, Spiderman, The Hulk; every boy wanted to be them and every girl wanted to be rescued by them. But did you ever notice that all the heroes were flawed in some way? Hulk had anger issues, Spiderman had girl trouble and Batman, well he was moody and spent a lot of time in a cave! The truth is even superheroes need saving. Do you really think that it was one person's job to save you?  News Flash, it was! Jesus Christ was kind of like a olde-worlde superhero. He healed sick people, kicked the devil's butt and saved humanity from being condemned for eternity; and to top it all off He made a way for you to know the big daddy Himself, G-O-D! Jesus was flawless. It says in the Bible that He was tempted to make bad choices (Matt 4), BUT HE DIDN'T! He chose to obey His Father in heaven in everything He did. Because of that He was able to die for us and in so doing break the power of sin, death and all the stupid decisions we have ever made in our lives. Because He was perfect, death and sin had no legal right to Him, so they couldn't keep hold of Him. Two days after He died, He came alive again! Not a ghost, but real flesh and bones, (John 20:27). Because Jesus was willing to pay the ultimate price and receive the punishment for your mistakes; you can be friends with God. Think about that today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD CAUSES EVERYTHING TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE WHO LOVE GOD</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROM 8:28 NLT</span><br>One day in an orchard, seven-year-old Walter noticed an owl sleeping on a branch. Thinking it would make a top pet he approached quietly and grabbed its leg. In a panic of beating wings and scratching claws the bird fought so much that the boy threw it down and stamped it to death. Horrified by his actions, he ran away. When he returned later to bury it, each shovelful of earth was mixed with tears. The incident haunted him and he told no one about it 'til years later when it had created in him a fresh appreciation for life. All the regret in the world couldn't bring back that one owl, but through its death a world of animals was born. The boy's name was Walter Elias... we know him as Walt Disney. 
The famous English writer Charles Dickens said, 'Reflect on your blessings of which every man has plenty, not on your past misfortunes of which all men have some.' Learn from your past, absolutely, but don't live in it. Use the things you've been through, good and bad, as a springboard to the future. Can you really do that? If you don't think it's possible pick up your Bible and pick just about any character used by God all the way from Genesis to Revelation. Over and over again you'll find that in amazing ways &quot;God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God.&quot; (Romans 8:28 NLT)  God can repaint your past in the light of his grace that got you to where you are today. So choose today to learn from it and move on.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE SAW HIM WITH OUR OWN EYES AND TOUCHED HIM WITH OUR OWN HANDS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 1:1 NLT</span><br>Today, someone you'll meet needs what you've got. They may not know it or even want it but they need it. What is it they need? Jesus! The great apostle John writes to encourage young Christians, 'We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands...now we testify...to you that he is the one' (1 John 1:1-2 NLT). John was speaking from his own first-hand experience and you can do the same. Your words will be even more effective if people also see proof of Jesus working in your life. If the way you deal with life is even more confused and chaotic than them why should they even bother showing an interest? 
The apostle Paul recalls the words he heard during his life-changing vision of the risen Jesus, like this, 'I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant and my witness...tell the world about this experience' (Acts 26:16 TLB). Listen: every experience you've had with Jesus has one purpose - to make you His 'servant' and His 'witness'. That's your job! And if you're serious about it, watch your mouth and watch your actions! You'll never win people to Christ if all they hear coming out of your mouth is totally negative and all you ever do is mope around looking miserable. Today you have the amazing privilege of being His servant and His witness, to introduce someone to Jesus, the One you've had a personal encounter with. Why not take a minute now to pray. Ask Jesus to make you more aware of the opportunities he wants to bring your way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WAS GLAD WHEN THEY SAID TO ME, &quot;LET US GO TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 122:1 NLT</span><br>Check this out: a university did a survey looking at whether being part of a church has any effect on a person's quality of life. They found that people who belong to a church are happier, enjoy better health and live longer than those who don't. Think about that! 
We can describe church using the image of a house, God's house. A house is the centre of family life. It's where lifelong relationships are formed. It's a place where every member feels valued just for being themselves. It's a place to belong, to love and be loved. And that's exactly the kind of place God wants his house to be. If you've ever watched 'Wife Swap' you'll know most homes aren't perfect but when people are willing to follow new rules of living they can get better. In the same way, when a church follows the rules of living Jesus taught they can become amazing places. 
In the time of King David there weren't any churches. People used to worship God in a massive tent. When you read the Psalms David wrote it's pretty obvious that it was his favourite place to be: 'One day spent in your house, this beautiful place of worship, beats thousands spent on Greek island beaches. I'd rather scrub floors in the house of my God than be honoured as a guest in the palace of sin' (Psalm 84:2,10 TM). There was nothing special about the tent to get David praising like that. No, he had a vision of God in his heart that meant he just wanted to be there to offer God the worship He deserves. How about you?

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN JESUS SAW THEIR FAITH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 2:5</span><br>The book of Mark describes a crazy day in the life of Jesus: '...four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man on a mat. They couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus' (Mark 2:3-4 NLT). When you're bringing someone to Jesus (in prayer, not on a mat), remember these three things: 
1) Break through the barriers! Nobody said bringing people to Jesus would be easy. These four men had to get round the crowd and through the roof. But they refused to give in or get discouraged. If what you've tried hasn't worked, ask God, He'll show you the way. Doctors can treat people but only the Lord can heal them within and without, so get them to Him. 
2) Flex your faith; it's what moves God! Mark writes, Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, &quot;My child, your sins are forgiven.&quot;' (Mark 2:5 NIV). Even though you're praying for someone who has little or no faith of their own, God will honour your faith, so put it into action! 
3) Don't go it alone. Any time you pick up the weight of another person you'll find it's a heavy load. Find someone who'll agree with you in prayer: 'If two of you...agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in Heaven' (Matthew 18:19 NIV). What a promise! And don't pick them up then drop them, stick with it. 
So, go ahead, bring them to Jesus expecting to receive; He won't disappoint you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE BATTLE IS THE LORD'S.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 17:47 NIV</span><br>As he stepped out to fight Goliath, David began to flow with faith-talk, 'You come against me with sword and spear...but I come against you in the name of the Lord...[He] will hand you over to me...and the whole world will know...there is a God in Israel...for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give all of you into our hands' (1 Samuel 17:45-47 NIV). Not one of the soldiers around him gave him any encouragement so David just got on with encouraging himself. He let his enemy know that he wasn't stepping out alone - the living God was with him. The same goes for you - if everyone around you is being neggy just ignore them!
So, if you're in a hopeless situation where there seems to be no way out, instead of wasting time and energy focusing on your weaknesses, begin to focus on God's power. When you focus on the enemy you stumble but when you focus on God the enemy stumbles. You'll never win if you fight in your own strength; so don't even go there! God's already 'given you authority...over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall...harm you' (Luke 10:19 AMP). Paul writes, 'Put on God's [coat of armour]...that you may be able successfully to stand... against [all] the strategies...of the devil' (Ephesians 6:11 AMP). Nobody keeps a coat of armour hanging in the wardrobe - you've got to put it on! And remember, the armour comes complete with the most powerful weapon in the universe; the sword of the Word of God; perfect for rushing giants!

Here are five stones you can use: 1) the stone of past successes. David remembered the way God had helped before saying, 'God, who delivered me from the...lion and...bear, will deliver me...' (1 Samuel 17:37 TM). The human memory usually hangs on to bad memories longer than good ones! So, why not get a notebook to keep track of the 'marvelous works...He has done' (1 Chronicles 16:12 NKJV) 2) the stone of prayer. 'Prayer is essential in this ongoing warfare' (Ephesians 6:18 TM); you can't win without it. For many years David was on the run from crazy king Saul but he kept praying to God who he called his 'defence and refuge' (Psalm 59:16 NKJV) 3) the stone of honour. Lots of arrogant people like to diss God but Christians are concerned with defending his honour. David's defend it by killing Goliath and proving 'There is a God in Israel' (1 Samuel 17:46). Involving God in your situation gives an opportunity for His grace and power to shine 4) the stone of passion. David was the only person in the nation with more passion than wisdom! Fighting Goliath was a stupid idea but God responded to David's passionate heart and gave him victory. Sometimes it's good to let your heart rule your head 5) the stone of preparation. You have to ask why David picked five stones. It was probably because he didn't know how many he'd need to do the job! 'It ain't over 'til it's over,' so be prepared, victory may not be instant but with God's help it will come in time.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AS GOLIATH MOVED...TO ATTACK, DAVID QUICKLY RAN...TO MEET HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 17:48 NLT</span><br>The Bible says, 'For forty days, twice a day' (1 Samuel 17:16 NLT) the massive warrior Goliath publicly dissed the people of Israel. His aim was to make them feel scared and ashamed. Today your giant may not be wearing body-armour and waving a massive sword, but you can bet that he'll use those same tactics of intimidation and humiliation. Many years before David and Goliath met on the battlefield Goliath's big family had been Israel's arch enemies. Armies led by Israel's great commander Joshua had blitzed them all; except those who lived in the city of Gath, where Goliath came from. Why is that detail important? Because if you leave your old enemy a leg to stand on he'll rise to fight again. Maybe you're dealing with issues your parents and grandparents never dealt with; things like addiction, divorce, anger and depression. When the Israelites 'heard the Philistine's challenge, they were terrified and lost all hope' (1 Samuel 17:11 TM). If that's how you feel, do what David did, 'As Goliath moved closer to attack, David...ran out to meet him.' 
Writer Max Lucado picks up this point and encourages us to apply it to our own lives: 'Rush your giant with a God-saturated soul!' Are you up for some of that? David had a clever sling that allowed him to throw stones and the Bible says God has equipped you too, 'with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left' (2 Corinthians 6:7 NIV)  You have the power to fight your giant, and win!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO MAY CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 24:3 NLT</span><br>Halfway up one of the mountains in the Swiss Alps there's a little cafe. The mountain itself takes a full day to climb from the bottom to the top but you can usually get to the cafe by lunchtime, and that's where you separate the men from the boys. When some amateur climbers feel the warmth of the fire and smell the good cooking they say to their mates, 'I'll just wait here while you go to the top. When you come back down I'll join you and we'll go to the base together.' Relaxation washes over them as they sit by the fire sipping the strong sugary coffee. But about 3:30 in the afternoon everything changes; they start looking toward the mountaintop as their friends reach it. Suddenly the atmosphere in the café changes and they think  'if only I'd kept climbing!' 
So what factors decide whether you end up in the café or on the mountaintop? There are at least tHree things: 1) tiredness. Jesus told Peter, 'I have prayed for you... that your faith may not fail' (Luke 22:31-32). We all have to find strength in Jesus to overcome times of failing faith 2) fear. Some days it seems like vertigo strikes our souls. We can't cope with the height of the mountain and we're tempted to give up. Then a voice whispers, 'Be strong and courageous...for the Lord your God will be with you' (Joshua 1:9 NIV) 3) comfort. Conflict and hard times keep us on our toes - and on our knees -  but having it easy all the time can con us into settling down short of our goal. So keep climbing!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOOK, THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH... HAS WON THE VICTORY. </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION  5:5 NLT</span><br>OK, this might sound obvious, but God is not your pet. In 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' by CS Lewis, the great Lion, Aslan, is based on Jesus. Mr. Beaver describes him like this, &quot;He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.&quot; Do you believe in a tame God? If you do you can't be reading the Bible very much. There are loads of stories of people who did stuff that God had made quite clear were totally out of order, and yes you guessed it, they didn't survive to tell the tale. Sure, God has an infinite ability to be patient and gracious but when he decides that it's time to make a point he'll go right ahead without asking anybody's permission - he doesn't need to - he's God. 
There was this guy called Uzzah ( 2 Samuel 6), who happened to be part of a procession that involved bringing a special box called 'the ark of the covenant' to King David. The box was special because God had poured his very essence into it - this was one seriously holy box. Maybe Uzzah played goalie for the local team because when the box started to topple off the cart it was being towed on he reached out to stop it falling. But by doing this he touched what belonged exclusively to God. He didn't live to tell the tale. That's hardcore isn't it. But you know what it tells us? God is God and he doesn't need human help. He understands the situation better than you ever could, and when the time is right He'll 'do wonders never before done' (Exodus 34:10 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE IS ABLE TO HELP US WHEN WE ARE BEING TEMPTED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 2:18 NLT</span><br>If you're struggling today, read these seven bits of Bible out loud to give you a boost!
1) 'The temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) 
2) '...thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ' (1 Corinthians 15:57 NLT)  
3) 'The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet...the grace [strength and enablement] of our Lord Jesus be with you' (Romans 16:20 NLT) 
4) 'Use every piece of God's armour so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil; so that after the battle you will still be standing firm' (Ephesians 6:13 NLT) 
5) 'Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don't be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand' (Isaiah 41:10 NLT) 
6) 'This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same temptations we do, yet he did not sin. So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it' (Hebrews 4:15-16 NLT) 
7) 'If God is on our side, can anyone be against us?' (Romans 8:31 CEV).
So, God's Word to you is loud and clear. Will you put your trust in it today?

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL BE MADE RICH...SO THAT YOU CAN BE GENEROUS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:11 NIV</span><br>You need to get God involved in your cash and keep Him involved. Your money is an area in which you can experience an interactive relationship with Him. You need to invite Him in. It's important to get God involved in every area of your life even when you're young. Why? Because God gives us keys to unlocking His best for our lives and He wants you to prosper in every way possible. One of His keys is the key of 'sowing and gathering'. What's that about? Well, if you take a hand full of seeds and sow them into the ground, in a few months you'll get a crop! It's simple! If you don't sow your seed into the ground when it comes to harvest time you'll have nothing but a handful of old seed! It's the same principle with your cash; if you hold on tightly to the little that you have, then in a year's time you'll still have the same amount of cash but if you sow it into a bank account that gives you good interest or if you invest in something that will increase in value, then when the next year comes round you'll have more money than you started out with. Awesome! Be a sower not a hoarder. Look at the cash you've got today and ask God for His wisdom and for Him to show you where you should sow your money. Getting God's advice is like gold dust because He'll never lead you into a bad investment and He'll always show you how to spend your money on what pleases His heart. Bonus!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T BE AFRAID...I AM WITH YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 41:10 NLT</span><br>It's easy to walk across a plank that's on the ground but raise it a little and it becomes harder. Now, imagine that same plank 100 feet up without a safety net under it; looks scary, doesn't it? The Bible says: 'Fear is crippling' (1John 4:18 TM). The more that's at stake the harder it is; white-knuckle syndrome kicks in and you develop a case of the 'what ifs.' Fear is living in the future before you get there. Inspirational speaker Dr. Joan Borysenko raises two issues; 
1) 'Fear of failure. When I was admitted to Harvard, I was sure there'd been a computer error and that I'd be exposed as a fraud. A lawyer friend of mine stops short of terror every time she has to give a final argument before a jury. Even when you're an expert fear doesn't necessarily go away. Accepting fear as part of the journey instead of running from it helps you conquer it! 
2) Fear of imperfection. This one makes it hard to do anything, because perfectionists set unattainable goals and berate themselves when they can't reach them. It's impossible to learn without making mistakes; so learn, and move on.'
God says, 'Don't be afraid...I am with you,' so ask yourself what He wants and stop worrying about pleasing everyone. Solomon said, 'Fear of human opinion disables [you]' (Proverbs 29:25 TM). When you look back at what you've already overcome you begin to realise that most times failure doesn't do permanent damage you actually grow through it! So stay focused; with God, you can walk any plank. Who knows, you might even begin to enjoy the challenge!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE WISE LISTEN TO OTHERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 12:15 NLT</span><br>We live in the day of 'talk, talk, talk,' with reality TV, 24-hour news programmes and talk-radio. The problem with that is we've learned to 'talk' but we're not very good at 'listening.' Solomon says, 'Don't talk so much...Be sensible and turn off the flow' (Proverbs 10:19 TLB). In other words, when you've nothing to say shut up! Why? Because the more you go on, the less people remember.  God designed your ears to stay open and your mouth to close because listening rarely gets you into trouble! Solomon writes: 'The man of few words...is wise...even a fool is thought...wise when he is silent' (Proverbs 17:27-28 TLB). So when you've got nothing good to say,  shut up! 
Proverbs 1:22-23 mentions people who are foolish and simple. The original term means, 'thick...dull...sluggish.' It describes those who are insensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others. We've all been at the mercy of a moody doctor who is really cold with us and the teacher who put us to sleep with his lesson.  Businessman, William C.Tacey writes, 'Poor listeners range from the impatient type, (That's nothing! Wait'll you hear what I've done), to the person who's so absorbed in his own thoughts that they're not even aware somebody's spoken. Learning to listen actively and constructively is as important as learning to speak, if your communication is to be effective.' Remember, a gossip talks about others, a bore talks about himself but a wise man talks to you, about you and then listens to what you have to say! When you're a good listener not only will people want to hang out, you'll grow wiser and win friends too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE GIVES US VICTORY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 15:57 NLT</span><br>God made you a winner! It's a fact. When you were conceived you won! Another word for winning is victory! Victory means, 'Success attained over a difficult situation or opponent. God has made you with one outcome in mind for your life and that is VICTORY! Why is this important to grasp? The devil wants you to think you're a loser, he wants you to walk around with a black cloud of failure over your head; so when you have challenges in life, you feel so rubbish about yourself you don't try to overcome them. He's scared of God's kids knowing who they really are because he knows that when they do, he won't have a leg to stand on. Listen: 'But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ' (1 Corinthians 15:57 NLT).  When you decided to follow Jesus, you became part of God's family. When you're in a family you have particular rights, you can help yourself to some grub and a drink without having to ask. It's kind of like that in God's family, except that instead of some food, you have access to His victory and instead of a drink, you can use the family Name that is above all other names (Philippians 2:9-11). You need to expect victory! Train your mind to think thoughts of success and encouragement; you'll be amazed at the results. When the devil gets up in your face and tries to intimidate you, you won't think, 'I can't do this I'm rubbish', you'll think, 'I'm a winner and I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'LL TAKE THE HAND OF THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE WAY...TO SHOW THEM WHAT ROADS TO TAKE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 42:16 TM</span><br>Are you facing a situation that feels overwhelming and you're afraid to make a wrong move? Maybe you're saying no to something in your life that you'd really like to say yes to. A well-known counsellor says, 'For years I heard about hiking. It sounded elusive, difficult...and mysterious. When a friend asked me to go hiking...I began thinking...what if I couldn't do it well enough? Or I didn't know how to do it at all? &quot;Don't be ridiculous,&quot; I scolded myself. &quot;You're making this more complicated than it is...it's just walking, and you've been doing that since you were a baby!&quot; We left...and I followed...as he started up a steep incline. &quot;Just walk&quot; I told myself...&quot;Put one foot in front of another...like you've done all your life.&quot; I didn't make it to the top of the mountain that day, but I made it halfway...Start where you are. Just start...if you already knew how to do it well, it wouldn't be a lesson...and you'd never have the thrill of victory, years from now looking back.'
God has promised to 'take the hand of those who don't know the way...to show them what roads to take.' You say, 'But what if feel out of my depth?' You probably will! But God says: 'When you're in over your head, I'll be there with you' (Isaiah 43:2 TM). You've got to be willing to 'go' in order for God to bring you 'through!' In other words you have to be willing to get your feet wet. The important thing to remember is: 'God...goes ahead of you' (Deuteronomy 1:30 TM). So you never have to face anything alone!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WORDS KILL, WORDS GIVE LIFE!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 18:21 TM </span><br>Have you ever been the topic of someone's gossip? Have you ever looked across a room and known that the group of people opposite are talking about you and throwing you dirty looks? Have you been part of that group, whispering, giggling and saying nasty things about another person? Listen: 'Words kill, words give life; they're either poison or fruit - you choose' (Proverbs 18:21 TM). The words that you speak have the power to hurt someone, destroy their reputation and make their life miserable or they have the power to encourage someone so that they feel better about themselves; to defend people that are being picked on and to speak the truth instead of lies. Which one would you rather be on the receiving end of? 
Talking badly about other people is destructive but it is also just as destructive for you to talk badly about yourself. When you make a mistake how do you react? Do you beat yourself up with words like, 'You idiot, how could you be so stupid!'? We've all done it at some time in our lives but what you need to remember when you are tempted to talk down about yourself, 'Words kill, words give life.' When you are critical and negative with your words it's as if you are making your soul drink poison, it will slowly eat away at your self esteem and emotions. When you are positive and encouraging with your words it's like giving your soul the tastiest apple to munch on! It builds you up and makes you strong and healthy. Remember, God is never negative and always encourages. Make that your word habit today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 69:1 TM</span><br>A woman driving through Texas saw a tornado approaching so she hid behind her car and watched as it demolished a little house nearby. Running over to what was now just a hole in the ground she saw a man with his eyes closed, 'Are you okay? Is anybody down there with you?' she asked. 'No,' he replied, 'Just me and God...having an urgent conversation!' 'Nothing fuels prayer like real need. In crisis even people who say they don't believe in God will try to pray. No matter how together you are there are some issues we can't resolve on our own. Listen:  'When I am in trouble, I pray, knowing you...listen' (Psalm 86:7 CEV). Sometimes your prayers, whether sung or shouted, are cries for assistance meant only for God's ears. When you're out of options your faith develops fast and emergencies become opportunities to experience God's power in a greater way.
So, if you're in over your head today here's a prayer just for you: 'Father, it feels like I'm in an impossible situation with no way out. I need to feel Your presence, the guidance of Your Spirit and to be reminded that with You all things are possible. Bring the answers of Heaven to my earthly situation. Touch it with Your grace. On the outside things look hopeless but You're the God who created the earth from nothing and rolled back the Red Sea so Your children could cross over safely. You make the blind see, the lame walk and the deaf hear. Today I thank You that You're my God, and with You nothing is impossible.' What ever the situation today, pray!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE HUMBLE...CONSIDER OTHERS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURSELVES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:3 CEV</span><br>A man bought a new TV and some of his neighbours were helping him install the aerial on the roof. They weren't making much headway until a new guy showed up with a big fancy toolbox and finished the job in a flash. As they stood around congratulating themselves, they asked the new neighbour what he made with such fancy tools. Grinning, he replied, 'Friends, mostly!' Unfortunately that kind of helpful behaviour has stopped being the norm in our world today: selfishness has become standard procedure. The Bible says: 'As the end approaches, people are going to be self-absorbed...self-promoting...dog-eat-dog...the kind...who smooth-talk...and take advantage' (2 Timothy 3:1-6 TM). Have you noticed any of that lately? Is your dad (or mum) prone to a bit of road rage or have you seen shoppers in the checkout line elbowing and pushing one another to save 30 seconds or people on a packed bus letting an elderly person stand instead of offering them a seat?
The principle of putting others first didn't originate from a nice person who was just having a really good day! It came directly from the God who inspired Paul to write, 'Be humble and consider others more important than your selves. Care about them as much as you care about yourselves.' Jesus Himself said, 'Here is a simple, rule-of-thumb...Ask yourself what you want people to do for you, then grab the initiative and do it for them' (Matthew 7:12 TM). So next time somebody is rude to you or treats you with less respect and consideration than you expect, instead of getting really annoyed and retaliating, use it as a great opportunity to practice putting them first.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD HAS GIVEN EACH OF US THE ABILITY TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WELL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:6 TLB</span><br>Everybody has certain gifts. Some of us can sing really well, others are amazing at maths and then there are those who can design buildings and paint masterpieces. God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. What happens to a team when its members play 'out of position?' First, morale weakens because the team isn't playing at its best. If you're forced to play in a position that you're just not good at it can make you frustrated and soon you'll become irritated and unwilling to work as part of a team. Then everyone's confidence weakens and the situation gets worse. Then the competition takes advantage of their weaknesses and they never win. When people aren't doing what they're supposed to do, things don't run well and people get hurt.
Do you know what your greatest strengths are? If not, follow these guidelines: a) be secure: don't allow your insecurities to get the better of you, be open to change. If you don't change you won't grow! b) get to know yourself: spend time exploring your gifts. Ask for feedback. Acknowledge areas that need work. c) trust your leader: look for a Godly leader you can trust and get on their team. d) see the big picture: your place on any team only makes sense in the context of the big picture; any wrong motives will rob you of the joy, fulfilment and success you desire. e) rely on your experience: there's only one way to know what your good at. Try things. Take risks. Learn from your failures and your successes. Discover what God made you for!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF YOU GIVE UP YOUR LIFE FOR ME, YOU WILL SAVE IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 9:24 CEV</span><br>When you obsess over problems instead of looking to God for solutions, the enemy will magnify your fears. If he can't get you to worry about the present he'll try to get you to worry about everything that could go wrong in the future! The last time you checked, wasn't God still bigger than any terrorist attack, world war, financial disaster, illness, accusation or mess you found yourself in? Well, He hasn't changed! David said, 'He won't go to sleep...The Lord is...at your right side... [He] will...keep you safe...wherever you go' (Psalm 121:3-8 CEV); plus His angels are watching over you 24/7. How cool is that?! 
It all comes down to faith vs. control. You can struggle to handle things on your own or trust your Heavenly Father. That's the choice! It's not about 'blind faith' or wishing that something good would happen. It's about believing that God is who He says He is and that if you trust Him you won't be let down. It's an issue you need to settle in your mind once and for all because if you don't believe He wants only the best for you, you'll keep trying to run the show. Control isn't responsibility. Responsibility is doing your part by praying, obeying and trusting God. Control is manipulating the circumstances to try and get the outcome you want. Jesus knows that we think we know what's best for our lives, so He said, 'If you want to save your life, you will destroy it. But if you give [it] up...for me, you will save it' (Luke 9:24 CEV). Bottom line; you either trust God or you don't!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD IS IN THIS PLACE, AND I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 28:16 NIV</span><br>Aren't you glad God's presence isn't reserved for people who 'deserve it?' He visits whiners and complainers, the impatient, those who are fed up with life, the doubtful and indecisive; He visits people who don't even agree on His existence and He reveals Himself to those who've followed Him their whole lives; His kids who've been saved by His grace. For example, Jacob wasn't really spiritual. Running away after swindling his brother and lying to his father, he didn't deserve what God did for him. After stopping for the night, he dreamed he saw a ladder to Heaven with angels on it, ascending and descending. Then God gave him this promise: 'I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go' (Genesis 28:15 NIV). When Jacob awoke next morning he said, 'The Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.' Author, Pearl Buck said, 'We see God every day, we just don't recognise Him.' Some of us are 'tuned in' when it comes to sensing His presence; others like Jacob can 'miss it' cause their focus is else where. 
Listen: 'Whether we're aware of it or not...every moment...we're encountering God...who is trying to catch our attention.' You never know how He'll make Himself known to you or who He'll speak through. After the resurrection Mary Magdalene thought Jesus was just the gardener! God can use all kinds of things to wake us up to Him; a miraculous healing, a restored relationship or even a really hard time. Later God revealed Himself to Jacob by wrestling with him and dislocating his hip. What will it take to get your attention?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ALWAYS FULL OF THE JOY OF THE LORD, AND ALWAYS THANKFUL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:11-12 TLB</span><br>Once there was an old and very wise man. Every day he and his granddaughter would sit outside a petrol station in his rocking chair, waiting to greet tourists as they passed through their small town. One day a tall man, who surely had to be a tourist, began looking around as if he were checking out the area for a place to live. 'So what kind of town is this?' he asked. The old man replied, 'Well, what kind of town are you from?' The tourist said, 'One where everyone is very critical of each other. It's a real negative place to live.' The old man said 'You know, that's just how this town is.' Later, a family passing through also stopped for petrol. The father stepped out and asked the old man, 'Is this town a good place to live?' He replied, 'Well, what about the town you're from?' The father said, 'In the town I'm from everyone is very close and always willing to lend a helping hand. I really hate to leave it.' The old man smiled and said, 'You know, that's a lot like this small town.' After the family had left the granddaughter looked up and asked, 'Grandpa, how come when the first man came you told him this was a terrible place to live, yet when that family came you told them it was a wonderful place to live?' The old man looked down into his granddaughter's wondering blue eyes and said, 'No matter where you go, you take your attitude with you. And that's what makes it terrible or wonderful.' Yep, life is what you make it!

'When did you phone it in?' the server asks. 'Oh I didn't,' you reply, 'I just thought perhaps you'd have something with my name on it.' Sound ridiculous? No more so than expecting God to answer requests you haven't made. The book of James says, 'The reason you don't have what you want is...you don't ask God.' Does that mean He'll automatically give you everything you ask for? No. James adds, 'Even when you do ask you don't get it because...you want only what will give you pleasure' (James 4:3 TLB). Your motives need to be in tune with what God knows is best for you. John says, 'This is the confidence...we have in Him...if we ask anything...according to His will...He...hears (1John 5:14 AMP). 
Lamentations 3:25 says, 'The Lord is good to those who wait...expectantly for Him' (AMP). Expectant prayer demonstrates confidence in God's goodness. Instead of stressing out and taking matters into your own hands, when you say, 'Lord, I'm going to trust you with this, no matter what happens,' He'll honour your faith. Paul says, 'Pray and ask God for everything you need, always giving thanks' (Philippians 4:6 NCV). Do you need a job? Help overcoming a problem? Do your friends or family need to become Christians? Need a deeper walk with God? Do you need physical or emotional healing? Jesus said, 'It gives your Father great happiness to give you the [benefits of his] Kingdom' (Luke 12:32 NLT). God wants to be good to you, so tell Him the  'desires of your heart' (Psalm 37:4 NKJV). Thank Him that the answer will come in His time!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD COULD COME BY RULE-KEEPING...CHRIST DIED UNNECESSARILY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 2:21 TM</span><br>Grace (the undeserved love that God gives us) doesn't give anyone permission to live as they please just saying  'God loves me so it doesn't matter'  but the 'judgmentalism' that comes from insisting that others live by our standards has caused untold damage. A well-known preacher writes, 'Legalism spreads a paralysing venom...blinds our eyes, dulls our edge and arouses pride in our heart...Love is overshadowed by a mental clipboard with a long check-list...requiring others to measure up...Soon friendship is fractured by a judgmental attitude and a critical look.' Think you're not guilty? Check out your own attitude when you meet another Christian who doesn't think, act or dress the way you do. You might break out a fake smile to disguise your real feelings but what is your head thinking? It doesn't take long before your mouth is talking! Jesus said, 'Never criticise...or it will all come back on you' (Luke 6:37 TLB). When you throw mud you don't just get your hands dirty, you lose ground! 'If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her' (John 8:7 NIV). Blowing another person's light out won't make yours shine brighter.
Paul writes: 'If a...relationship with God could come by rule-keeping...Christ died unnecessarily.' You say, 'But what if someone is getting off track or deliberately sinning?' Paul answers 'If another believer is overcome by some sin...humbly help that person back onto the right path...be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself&quot; (Galatians 6:1 NLT).  It's good that we try to live God's way but it isn't a competition. Build people up, don't knock them down and show them the grace that God has shown you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET US GO OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 4:35 NIV </span><br>Sometimes you only learn to swim by getting thrown into the deep end. When that happens you discover that: a) if you let it, your fear will take you under b) you can only tread water for so long c) when you get to a certain point there's no turning back, you have to keep going. It's fatal to stop or give up in the middle of the process d) what God has put within you (the air in your lungs) will sustain you and keep you afloat if only you learn to relax, trust God and keep strokin'!
If you're really serious about getting to the other side  you've got to take what's in front of you and keep pushing it behind you. In other words, keep strokin'! You might be crying while you're swimming but keep strokin'. Your heart may be about to come out of your chest but keep strokin'. It's when you feel backed into a corner with nowhere to go that you've to reach down, take hold of what God put within you and keep strokin'. Sometimes you have to rise up in faith and fight your way through, confident that God is on your side. The waters you're in don't determine your destiny; they can either carry you over or take you under. Your faith has got to rise up and fight your fear. If you quit, God can do nothing more for you. So whether you're doing the breaststroke, the backstroke or some other kind of stroke nobody's even heard of keep strokin'!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>Psychologists say it takes up to three weeks to get familiar with a new habit; then another three weeks before it takes root. You've got to get beyond that six-week barrier! 
Here's a simple formula for developing a healthy habit: 
1) Get some help: The Bible says 'Encourage one another daily' (Hebrews 3:13 NIV). So become accountable to someone. Ask them to encourage you and to remind you of the promise you made to God. 
2) Never allow an exception. It's easy to say 'Just this once I won't do it' but once can quickly turn to twice. A healthy habit will grow strong when you don't give in so don't make excuses, not even once! 
3) Grab every opportunity to practice your new habit. Whenever you get the slightest urge to practice it, do it right. Don't wait; use that moment to reinforce it. It doesn't hurt to overdo a new habit when you are first starting. 
4) Rely on the power of God. When all is said and done, you must realise you're in a spiritual battle and that you can only succeed by the power of the Holy Spirit inside you. So pray that God will strengthen you. Depend on Him to help you develop the habit for His glory. Right now why don't you find a pen and paper and write down the following words, signing your name at the bottom of them. Then keep them somewhere you will constantly see them: 'Lord, I commit myself to spending a definite time with You every day, no matter what the cost. And I'm depending on You to help me to stick at it. Amen.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>It can be really difficult to stick at your quiet time with God (that's why we've spent nearly a whole week talking about it!) When pressures push in, what's the first thing you're tempted to drop? Satan knows if he can keep you from it he's won the battle because he'll have no opposition from you. Christians who have fallen away from God will tell you, 'It started when I lost my quiet time with God.'  'So how can I overcome this problem?' you ask: a) make a promise with God and be serious about it: 'When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it...It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfil it' (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5 NIV) b) put it on your diary. Block out time to meet with God each day. Can you imagine keeping an appointment that's more important? c) be ready for the devil's attacks. Follow the Cub Scout motto, 'Be prepared' or as Dr Robert G Lee used to say, 'If you wake up in the morning and don't meet the devil face on, it means you're headed in the same direction!' d) leave your Bible open the night before at the passage you intend to read in the morning. When you wake up it will serve as a reminder to have your quiet time. 
'But what if I miss a day?' Don't worry and don't go on a guilt trip. If you miss a meal it doesn't mean you gave up eating! You just eat a bit more at the next meal and go on from there.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>Once you have won 'the battle of the blankets' and 'the battle of the blahs,' you'll have to fight 'the battle of the brain.' Your mind will wander off in 101 directions during your quiet time. The devil will make sure it does. You'll find yourself distracted by noises, lack of sleep, tensions with others, school work and things you 'just can't forget.' So here are some helpful suggestions: a) be sure you're thoroughly awake. Take a shower, splash cold water on your face or do some exercise. Get the adrenalin flowing! The Psalmist writes, 'As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God' (Psalm 42:1 NIV). A deer being pursued by a hunter has only one thing in mind; getting to the stream where its wounds can be healed, its thirst quenched and its strength renewed  b) use a memo pad. When you decide to spend time with God you'll suddenly 'remember' everything you have to do or have left undone. So write things down as they come to you then tell yourself, 'I'll get to that later,' and go back to prayer. c) pace while you're praying. You won't fall asleep while standing up, so move around. d) personalise the Scriptures. Pray them back to God. Since God's Word is always in line with God's will, your prayers will get answered. For example, use Psalm 23: 'Lord, You are my Shepherd, therefore I shall not want for anything. Thank You for leading me in paths that are right when I don't know which way to go.' This simple technique can transform your quiet time.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>You say you're not getting much out of your quiet time? The author, Rick Warren refers to this as 'the battle of the blahs.' He writes: 'You can never judge your quiet time by your emotions. Emotions may lie; feelings may come and go. If you only have a quiet time when you &quot;feel&quot; like it, the devil will make sure you never feel like it. Some days will seem bland. On other days you'll think Heaven has opened up to you. So don't expect a glorious &quot;experience&quot; every morning. Not having goose-bumps doesn't mean God is not present.' Dry spells can be caused by: a) disobedience. He won't reveal step two until you've taken step one. If God's told you something make sure you are doing it b) being in a hurry. Samuel Chadwick said, 'Hurry is the death of prayer', so go for quality and content, not mileage! c) being in a rut. When your quiet time becomes a ritual instead of a relationship, it dies. So be flexible; change your routine, keep it interesting for you and the Lord d) not sharing your thoughts with others. When we give out, we get back more in return. Share your quiet-time thoughts with others and see what happens. 
If you're still not getting anything out of it, tell God about it. It takes time to develop a relationship. You must learn to see God in all kinds of circumstances in order to get to know Him well. So don't give up: 'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up' (Galatians 6:9 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>For the next few days let's deal with some 'quiet time problems.' Today we'll look at: The problem of discipline, also known as the battle of the blankets! It faces you the moment you wake up. Your body may be protesting at the thought of starting a new day; it's a battle to get out of bed. So here are some tips on overcoming this problem: a) go to bed on time. Too many of us stay up late watching TV or sitting on MSN and Myspace, so we have a hard time getting up in the morning. Dawson Trotman, a writer and preacher, lived by the Bible verse 'Early will I seek you.'  Even if he had mates over the night before, he would excuse himself and go to bed because his top priority was meeting with Jesus each morning b) get up as soon as you wake up. If you lie there thinking about it, you've already lost the battle. When you wake up in the morning it's not the time to pray 'Jesus should I get up?' If you have to pray about it, do so the night before and pray that you'll have the willpower to do it. Resolve like the Psalmist, 'In the morning, O Lord, you hear my voice' (Psalm 5:3 NIV) c) go to bed thinking about Jesus. Fall asleep with the attitude of, 'See you in the morning, Lord.' Ask Him to wake you up with thoughts of Him. One of the best ways to do that is to go to sleep with a Scripture verse on your mind. 'Do not let this Book...depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night' (Joshua 1:8 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>A famous preacher said, 'I want to hear God's voice before anyone else's in the morning. And His is the last voice I want to hear at night.'  David and Daniel met with the Lord three times daily (see Psalm 55:17; Daniel 6:10). Whatever time you set, stick at it.  Put a reminder in your phone, pda, calendar; whatever!  Just make a date with God  and keep it! 
The question is often asked, 'How much time should I spend? Here are some guidelines:
1) Don't start with a two-hour quiet time. You might last a day or maybe two but then you'll get discouraged. You need to grow in your relationship with God like you do in any other. So begin with a few minutes and let it grow. 
2) Don't clock-watch. That will ruin your quiet time faster than anything else. Decide what you can do in God's Word and prayer during the time you've selected; then do it! Sometimes it'll take more time than you've set aside, sometimes less but don't keep looking at your watch. 
3) Go for quality, not quantity. It's what you do during your quiet time, whether 15 minutes or two hours,  that's important. 
4) Choose a special place. 'Next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord' (Genesis 19:27 NIV). Your special place ought to be a place where a) you can pray out loud without embarrassment b) you're comfortable; (don't have your quiet time in bed; that's too comfortable!). As the days go by your special place will come to mean everything to you because of the awesome times you have there with God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 63:1 NIV</span><br>When you come to meet with God you should check you attitude. Have you got: 
1) Expectancy. Expect to 'give and get' from your time together. Expect a time of intimacy. It's impossible to have a love affair in a crowded public place; intimacy calls for being alone with the one you love. The Bible uses the example of the closest possible relationship when it talks about us and Jesus, the example of the Bridegroom and His bride. 
2) Respect. Don't rush your time with God. Prepare your heart by being still for a minute before talking to Him. Deliberately clear away the cluttered thoughts of the day. Respect is reminding yourself with whom you are meeting; God! 'You are worthy...to receive glory and honour' (Revelation 4:11 NIV). 
3) Alertness. God deserves your full attention so give God the best part of your day; when you are on top form. You might be a morning person like Jesus: 'Very early in the morning...Jesus...went off to a solitary place, where he prayed' (Mark 1:35 NIV) or you might be a night owl like David: 'On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night' (Psalm 63:6 NIV)  
4) Willingness. This attitude is crucial: you won't develop a deeper relationship with God if you've already made your mind up about what you will or won't do if He asks. Decide right now to do everything God wants you to do. Jesus said, 'If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God' (John 7:17 NIV). So, once again, check your attitude if you want to move on with God today.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NOR WILL I OFFER...THE LORD...THAT WHICH COST ME NOTHING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 SAMUEL 24:24 NKJV</span><br>Hard work = sweat! A long, long time ago when Adam and Eve were banned from the Garden of Eden they had to 'sweat to earn a living' (Genesis 3:19 CEV). Farmers sweat to turn their crops into cash, the same as bricklayers sweat on a building site or an executive sweats over writing a report for an important deadline. You tend to value what you have to work for and God values your efforts as well. That's why when David had the chance to offer God a sacrifice he said, 'Nor will I offer...the Lord...that which cost me nothing.' 
So what does your worship to God cost you? Not in terms of money but in terms of energy. This doesn't necessarily mean singing loudly and raising your hands in church (but it might). In-depth worship goes far beyond that. The word worship comes from an old Anglo-Saxon word 'worth-ship,' which is 'the act of giving worth or value to a person or object'. In the New Testament worship can be understood as serving, singing, showing proper respect, humility, love and generosity. That's right, even the offering bag at church is part of worship where you give back to God a tasty slice of the dosh He's given you. It's another way of honouring Him with the result of your sweat! When you sacrifice sleep to get up early and spend time with God, you're also doing something that costs you and when you go out of your way to help somebody in need, you're offering God something of real worth (see 1 John 3:17). So check your heart today and make sure you're giving God something of value.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL EXPERIENCE GOD'S PEACE, WHICH IS FAR MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE HUMAN MIND CAN UNDERSTAND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:7 TLB</span><br>Catherine Marshall writes 'A king once offered a prize to the artist who could paint the best picture of peace. Many tried, but there were only two the king really liked. One was of a calm lake. It was a perfect mirror for the peaceful towering mountains all around it. Overhead was a blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The other picture had mountains too. But they were rugged and bare. Above them was an angry sky from which fell rain, and in which lightning played. Down the side of the mountains tumbled a waterfall. This did not look peaceful at all. But when the king looked closely he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in spite of the rush of angry water, she sat on her nest; in perfect peace. Which picture do you think won the prize? The king chose the second picture. Why? &quot;Because&quot;' explained the king, &quot;peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. Peace means to be in the middle of all these things and still be calm in your heart.&quot;'
At some point we all discover that there's no safe harbour free from storms. At that point peace becomes even more special than we'd imagined because peace brings with it: a) the assurance of God's reality and protection right in the middle of them b) the growth of our faith and character because of them c) God's solid promise to bring us through situations stronger and wiser.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T DO YOUR GOOD DEEDS PUBLICLY, TO BE ADMIRED BY OTHERS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:1 NLT</span><br>When you do something for somebody expecting the favour to be returned, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Jesus said, 'When you help someone...do it - quietly and unobtrusively' (Matthew 6:3-4 TM); 'Your Father knows what is done in secret, and he will reward you' (Matthew 6:4 CEV). There are certain things everybody has a right to, like basic respect but too often we place expectations on other people that they will never be able to fulfil. Then when they don't meet our demands we act hurt, when in reality it was our own misguided assumptions that caused the problem.
A well-known counsellor says, 'Many of us have unmet needs from the past...we want others to fulfil our desire to be loved unconditionally...some of us are so needy we drive people away.' Couples can be really tragic at projecting on to each other things they need to work on personally. It's not fair to expect another person to 'fix you' or try to make them whom you want them to be in order to make you happy. That kind of behaviour just causes stress, arguments and an unhealthy dependency you'll end up dealing with later. Do you ever expect other people to read your mind when you haven't taken the time to spell out your expectations? How can you blame somebody for not doing something they didn't know you wanted?! Understand this: people aren't your answer, God is. If He chooses to use a certain person to bless you He'll do it; if not He'll use somebody else. So check your thinking today and ask God to reveal and remove any unrealistic expectations you're living with.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I DELIGHT TO DO THY WILL, O MY GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 40:8</span><br>Ruth Graham writes: 'Tonight I sit on the porch, our old German Shepherd dog lying at my feet. Thunder rumbles in the distance. As the storm nears, he tears into the front yard to meet it...furiously doing battle. As it passes he returns to the porch, convinced he has driven it away. He's a German guard dog carefully trained in search and rescue, attack and obedience. Search and rescue in these mountains can come in handy. I cannot imagine an occasion on which I would give the order to attack. But a well-trained dog can sense hostility or spot a weapon (even what resembles a weapon), in which case it's a wise person who freezes in his tracks. But it's the obedience training that gives real joy. To stop, to sit, to lie down, to go away, to search, to stay, to heel. A disobedient dog is not only a headache; he can be a liability. Obedience makes a dog a joy. Is it less so with God and His children? There are some I knew who have been trained in attack. We will not mention their names. You may know a few, but they are skilled at it. Then there are those trained in search and rescue. And there are those who have been trained in obedience. I think this, more than anything else, must give the Lord pleasure. Simple obedience. Joyful, eager, unquestioning obedience; to be able to say with the Psalmist, &quot;I delight to do thy will, O my God,&quot; would be the height of training for the Christian. For this is what gives God the greatest pleasure.'

<title><![CDATA[Practice self-discipline!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR A SERVANT...DISCIPLINE IS NEEDED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 29:19 NLT</span><br>Solomon said, 'It is better to have self-control than to conquer a city' (see Proverbs 16:32 NLT). So, how are you doing when it comes to self-control? Here are four easy steps to start making it more of a reality in your life: 
1) Don't always do the easy or fun stuff first. You know the sort of stuff that typically gets ignored; making your bed, picking up your clothes off the floor, washing the dishes! And if you get sidetracked halfway through, make yourself go back and finish the job! 'Work hard at whatever you do' (Ecclesiastes 9:10 CEV). Plus, don't start several things all at once; do one thing at a time! 
2) Discipline yourself to be punctual. Lateness is a hard habit to break. To beat it you must be brave enough to call it what it is; inconsiderate, selfish behaviour. 
3) Plan ahead. Everything takes longer than you think, so don't wait 'til the last minute then rush around like a chicken with its head cut off. Living under that sort of constant pressure leads to being over-stressed but getting started early will mean you enjoy doing stuff much more! 
4) Accept correction without sulking or getting defensive. The Bible says, 'Wisdom is found in those who take advice' (Proverbs 13:10 NIV). If you're wise you'll welcome honest feedback about your attitude.  
Ask God to help you control your unruly thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Identify unmanageable areas in your life, ditch the excuses, face the truth even when it hurts, refuse to feel sorry for yourself and set a few attainable goals. 'Learn to sense what is vital...and of real value' (Philippians 1:10 AMP).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I AM PRAYING...YOUR BODY IS AS HEALTHY AS...YOUR SOUL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>3 JOHN 2 TLB</span><br>We all know how important physical health is but here's a plan for your soul health: a) don't question your faith, question your doubts. Don't spend time dwelling on grey areas; God is amazingly colourful and that's where you'll find your faith! b) don't be a lone ranger. It's no accident that the Old Testament contains the story of God's people and that Paul's letters were written to congregations. We grow as we relate not as we isolate! c) guard your thought life. If your 'thinking is controlled by the sinful self, there is death. But if [it's] controlled by the Spirit, there is life and peace' (Romans 8:6 NCV). Practice a bit of mind management! d) give thanks to God before you fall asleep and when you wake up! It'll transform your week. 'In every thing give thanks!' (1 Thessalonians 5:18). e) ditch anything that distracts you from God. Toss out those gossipy magazines and if you've got the guts put the X-box back in its box for a few days! f) always choose the side of grace. Philip Yancey writes: 'I marvel at the humility of a God who descends to live inside...his 'flawed' creatures...Do I show that same attitude towards people of whom I disapprove?' g) don't be vague about your faith. Paul wasn't 'ashamed of the Gospel' (Romans 1:16); neither should you be. h) give a second chance to people who annoy you. God chose them too! Sometimes it's easier to be gracious to non-believers than to uptight 'churchy' people but that just makes you a different kind of judgmental. i) forgive those who've hurt you. Hatred hinders healing. So bring your hurts to God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WEAR LOVE. IT'S YOUR BASIC, ALL-PURPOSE GARMENT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:14 TM</span><br>A grandmother celebrating her golden wedding anniversary shared the secret of her long, happy marriage: 'On my wedding day I decided to make a list of 10 of my husband's faults, which for the sake of our marriage I would overlook. I never did get around to listing any. Each time my husband did something I didn't like I would say to myself, &quot;Lucky for him that's one of the 10!&quot;' She was a wise lady!
Today's culture is obsessed with physical intimacy and the desires that bring you together but only God teaches the lessons in grace that will keep you together! Here's an idea that will help your relationship go the distance. When your boyfriend or girlfriend upsets you, instead of responding with angry words (or angry silence), stop and remind yourself that this is an opportunity to 'grow in grace.' Don't worry if you didn't do too well last time, you'll get another opportunity and probably pretty soon too and you'll keep getting them. Relationships are full of opportunities to be generous and opportunities to be forgiving.
This awesome Bible verse ought to be framed and hung on your wall: 'Dress in the wardrobe God picked out for you: compassion, kindness, humility, quiet strength, discipline. Be even-tempered, content with second place, quick to forgive an offence. Forgive as quickly and completely as the Master forgave you. And regardless of what else you put on, wear love. It's your basic, all-purpose garment. Never be without it. Let the peace of Christ keep you in tune with each other, in step with each other. None of this going off and doing your own thing' (Colossians 3:12-15 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET US EXAMINE OUR WAYS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LAMENTATIONS 3:40 NIV	</span><br>A lad rushed into a petrol station one day and asked the assistant behind the counter if the shop had a pay phone. She pointed to her right, 'It's just there.' The lad inserted his coins, dialled and waited for an answer. Finally someone came on the line. 'Uh, hello,' he said in a deep voice, 'Could you use an honest, hard-working young man?' The shop was quiet and assistant couldn't help overhearing... After a moment the lad said, 'Oh, you already have an honest, hard-working young man? Well, okay. Thanks all the same.' He hung up the phone and started walking back to his car, a broad smile stretched across his face. 'Hey, just a minute,' the shop assistant said, 'I couldn't help but hear your conversation. Why are you so happy? I thought the man said he already had someone and didn't need you?' The lad smiled. 'Well, you see, I am that honest, hard-working young man. I was just checking up on myself!'
If you're serious about walking with God, check yourself regularly. Are you praying, reading God's Word and renewing your mind daily? How about your attitudes? Are they slipping? Your attitudes are like traffic lights that send a signal before you've said a word. Sometimes they flash red, which means 'stop, don't get in my way, I'm too busy to care about you.' Sometimes they flash yellow, which means 'I'm touchy and mixed-up, I could go either way.' Sometimes they flash green, which means, 'I'm ready to make time for you, you can count on me.' The Bible says, 'Let us examine our ways...and...return to the Lord.' 
What needs to be examined today? 'Our ways!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'M...ONLY A MAN, NO DIFFERENT FROM YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 10:26 TM</span><br>Role models inspire and motivate us, especially when they've been through similar things in life that we have. It's good to respect and appreciate them but the moment you set your role model up on a pedestal you're asking for trouble. Watch out that your inspiration doesn't become your obsession. Make sure that you keep your God-given uniqueness and don't become a carbon copy of somebody else. Remember, our heroes wrestle with character issues too. The Apostle Paul knew his limits and described himself as 'not...good enough to be called an apostle,' then added, 'God's grace has made me what I am' (1 Corinthians 15:9-10 NCV). The Apostle Peter even had to deal with people bowing down to him, 'The minute Peter came through the door, Cornelius was...down on his face worshiping him! Peter pulled him up and said, &quot;None of that - I'm...only a man, no different from you.&quot;' Unfortunately some of the people we look up to aren't that humble!
The danger in hero-worship is losing your individuality and missing the path God mapped out for you. Some of the lessons God teaches us may be similar but ultimately another person's purpose will be completely different from yours. For example, the cool guy in school takes Art so you do too. The problem is he can draw and you can't! 
There's a strange verse in the Bible that says 'God is...a jealous God' (Deuteronomy 4:24 NKJ) but it doesn't mean He's fussy or stroppy, it means He wants to protect us from anything that robs us of our uniqueness or threatens our relationship with Him. So make Jesus your role model and hero and then you're on safe ground!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU PREPARE A FEAST FOR ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:5 NLT</span><br>In the old days, when a little village came under attack from another village that was stronger than them, they would go to the chief of a bigger town and ask them to fight against the army that was coming to pick a fight. If the chief agreed to help then he and the head of the village would make a covenant (a special kind of promise) with each other. It was vital that this was done for all eyes to see, so they would have a banquet together on top of a hill. By doing this it would become obvious to the opposing side that they were now comrades. Making this covenant was basically saying, 'If you mess with them, you mess with us too.' Did you know that when you say 'Yes' to Jesus you make a covenant with God?! A covenant is your special promise to God, that you will love and follow Him your whole life and His covenant to you is His special promise to love you, provide for you and loads more. One of his special promises is to protect you and fight for you in difficult times. Listen: 'You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies.' So next time the enemy has a pop at you, remind him who you are in covenant with and watch him do a runner. Remember that your heavenly Father is not just the chief of some town or city or even nation; He's the awesome God of the whole universe and He won't stand for any one messing with His mates!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHOSE WEAKNESS WAS TURNED TO STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:34 NIV</span><br>Joni Eareckson Tada tells the story 'Every morning Connie opens Diane's door to begin the long routine of exercising and bathing her paralyzed friend. The sun's rays slant through the blinds, washing the room in a golden glow. The folds of the covers haven't moved since Connie pulled them up around Diane the night before. Yet she can tell her friend has been awake for awhile. 'Are you ready to get up yet?' 'No...not yet,' comes the weak reply from under the covers. Connie sighs, smiles and clicks shut the door. The story is the same every new day at Connie and Diane's apartment. Sunrise stretches into mid-morning by the time Diane is ready to sit up in her wheel chair. But those long hours in bed are significant.  In her quiet sanctuary Diane turns her head slightly on the pillow, toward the corkboard on the wall. Her eyes scan each photo. Every torn piece of paper carefully pinned in a row. She's praying. The creeping limitations of multiple sclerosis encroach further each year. Her fingers are curled and rigid. Her voice is barely a whisper. People might look at her and say, 'What a shame. Her life has no meaning.' But Diane is convinced that her life is significant; that her labour of prayer counts. She moves mountains that block the paths of missionaries; helps open the eyes of the spiritually blind in Southeast Asia, pushes back the kingdom of darkness that blackens the alleys of the gangs in East Los Angeles Diane is on the front lines, advancing the Kingdom of God. This woman sees her place in the world. It doesn't matter that others may not recognize her significance, she is a child of the King'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOVE...ALWAYS LOOKS FOR THE BEST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 13:4&amp;7 TM</span><br>Love is a funny thing. There are so many different opinions flying around about what love really is and how to know when you've fallen in love with someone. Did you know that love comes in many forms? There is the friendship kind of love that you feel for your friends and family. Then there is the romantic love that you may feel for a particular person (and hopefully they feel it for you too!). In the Bible Jesus also talks about loving your enemies (Matthew 5:44). That can be so hard and a real challenge. How are you supposed to love someone who does your head in and makes your life miserable? Start by praying for them. Prayer is powerful! If you pray for the person who annoys you and ask God to bless them and if you make a choice to only say nice things about them then gradually you will experience a change of heart towards them. You might not end up being best mates but the anger and negativity you felt towards them will melt away. Try it, prayer works! 
Jesus says, 'If all you do is love the lovable, do you expect a bonus? Anybody can do that' (Matthew 5:47 TM). God wants us to represent Him on earth and He loves everybody, despite whether they love Him back. So we need to try and love all people. Not with a soppy romantic love but with a supernatural love that comes from God; it's a love that never comes to an end and always looks for the good in people (1 Corinthians 13: 4-13).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MEN AND WOMEN LOOK AT THE FACE; GOD LOOKS INTO THE HEART.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAM 16:7 TM</span><br>King David wasn't born with a crown on his head and a load of people around him waiting to peel him a grape! He was the youngest of eight brothers; they were good looking, trained fighters and much more obvious choices as potential king material. No way would anyone even take a look at some scrawny shepherd boy, with sheep poo between his toes and a sling over his shoulder but God saw deeper qualities that weren't immediately obvious. His passionate and courageous heart made him God's perfect candidate to rule over Israel. That meant it didn't matter what other people thought; he was God's choice for the job! When the prophet Samuel came to anoint David as king, God said to him, 'Looks aren't everything...God judges persons differently than humans do. Men and women look at the face; God looks into the heart.' 
You only have to pick up a magazine and it's obvious that people are obsessed with image. The pressure to look perfect is pushed in our faces every time we turn on the TV. The fact is that God isn't looking to see if you have the latest Gucci sunglasses or Armani jeans before He'll pick you to be part of His group. He has hand picked you for a fantastic adventure and all He is bothered about is that your heart loves Him 100%. Before David was handed his crown he learnt how to be a happy being a shepherd and before anything else, to love God with his whole heart!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FORGETTING THE PAST AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT LIES AHEAD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:13 NLT</span><br>What do people mean when they say, 'Oh; forget about it'? You can't exactly choose to forget something can you? In fact because of the way the brain works, if you try to forget something you're more likely to remember it! No, 'forget about it' doesn't mean losing awareness of what happened, it just means let go of it. So what do you need to forget about or let go of? Maybe someone hurt you. So forgive them. If you're the cause of someone else's pain, make a choice to stop it and ask God to forgive you. Then you need to forgive yourself. Paul had it nailed, listen: 'Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize' (Philippians 3:13). Paul understood that if he dwelled on the mistakes he'd made and the trials he went through he would spend his life feeling like a failure. That's pointless! 
In an interview famous tennis player, Andre Agassi was asked what the key was to competing successfully. He said that every point he played he played it like it was his first. He disciplined himself not to focus on the last point; no matter how good it was. If he focused on that he might fall into the trap of pride and get sloppy in his game. If he focused on the bad points he would fear another mistake. So if someone hurts you, make a choice to forgive and move on. You'll soon realise that to forgive and not dwell on the past will make you feel happy and really free of any pain!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JONAH GOT UP AND WENT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO GET AWAY FROM THE LORD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JONAH 1:3 NLT</span><br>Jonah was a good bloke, he loved God and wanted to do what God asked Him to; until one day God spoke to Jonah and told him to go on a preaching tour in a big, bad city called Nineveh. Now when God said that, Jonah had a funny reaction. Instead of saying, 'OK God, off I go to Nineveh,' he jumped on a boat and went in the opposite direction! A storm came; the sailors panicked and chucked Jonah over board thinking he was cursed. Harsh! If that wasn't enough Jonah then gets swallowed by a massive fish and spends the next three days sitting in its guts. Wow, talk about making a bad choice! It takes all of this for Jonah to realise it's better to do God's will than to run away from it.  So often God asks us to do something and because we get afraid of looking stupid we run away or try and ignore God.
The fish eventually puked Jonah onto a beach. Rather wisely Jonah didn't run away from his calling a second time, no, he went to Nineveh and did what God said and because of that an entire city was saved from destruction! So even though Jonah may not have been the most popular bloke in the city preaching his message of doom and gloom, he was obedient to God. That always makes more of a statement than going along with the crowd. Don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in and do what God asks. You never know who might be saved because of you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>OTHERS GAVE WHAT THEY'LL NEVER MISS...SHE GAVE HER ALL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 12:44 TM</span><br>Did you know that Jesus is the master of making a little go a long way? He fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish; he turned six huge jars of water into gallons and gallons of wine and made money come out of a fish to pay the local taxman! What's that about? It's amazing to think that Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world wants to spend time with you! Not only that, He wants to take hold of your gifting and talents and make them grow and grow. All you need to do is be available. 
So just how do you make yourself available to God? Start by saying to Him, 'God, I know I don't have much to offer You, but what I do have, I want You to take and make into something awesome. I want what I do to count; but I know it will only count if You are number one in my life.' In the Bible Jesus bigged up a widow because she gives her last two pennies away out of her love for God. He thought it was so cool that He even pointed her out to His disciples, 'Others gave what they'll never miss...she gave her all' (Mark 12:44 TM). If you are willing to give your 'all' to God, you'll be amazed at the amount He produces out of what you have given to Him. Whether it's your time, talents or money God is looking for a heart that is willing to be used in the great adventure of building His kingdom. Are you willing today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE MADE YOU A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 17:5 NIV</span><br>The things you choose to spend your money on really show what you value; and in some cases what you love. You might hate having to save up for stuff; after all it's a buzz to get what we want fast and with no effort involved! If, like most people, you have to save up to get that Nintendo Wii or the latest mobile phone, you will probably value it and be more grateful for it than you would be if it just arrived out of the blue without any sacrifice. 
Anything you've had to work hard for will have greater value to you than something you got in five minutes. That can be a hard lesson to learn sometimes but if you look in the Bible at the lives of some of some of the greatest people they started out with a promise from God and had to hold onto that promise for years, until they saw what God had promised happen. God said to Abraham, 'I have made you a father of many nations.' He said it when Abraham and his wife were really old and had no kids! But even though Abraham was flippin' ancient, he held onto God's promise and at the ripe old age of about 102 Abraham became the father of Isaac and so started the family line that led to the birth of Jesus and because of Jesus, millions believe in God today...so God's promise to Abraham came true...even though he had to wait a while. So don't worry if God says, 'wait', it will happen in His timing, which is the best!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS, THERE YOUR HEART WILL ALSO BE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:21 NIV</span><br>Did you know that you are a treasure to God? Jesus tells His disciples a story about a bloke who was a pearl merchant and one day he finds a beautiful pearl that had massive value and was worth loads of money. So he goes and sells all that he has so that he can own that one pearl (Matthew 13:45-46). He knew that having that pearl was more important than owning everything else.  To him the pearl was a treasure and he was willing to do anything he could to get it. 
Do you know that you have massive value? You are like that pearl. God found you buried in the darkness and saw that even covered in loads of mud you were beautiful and worth so much. So He made a plan to rescue you. He gave away the very thing that He loved the most; His son. Jesus became a living, breathing, walking, talking, hurting, hassled human. Through His life, death and resurrection He paid the price so that we could be rescued from darkness, cleaned up and put on display to show the world how great God is! It says in the Bible, 'Where your treasure is, there your heart will also be' (Matthew 6:21 NIV). If you are God's treasure then that must mean that His heart is totally captivated by you. He loves you and wants you to treasure Him like He treasures you; to value your time with Him like that pearl. That's not too much to ask is it? So ask yourself today, what do I treasure?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LIKE A TREES ALONG A RIVER BANK BEARING FRUIT EVERY SEASON.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 1:3</span><br>You might have noticed that quite a lot of worship songs talk about God's presence. It means that God makes His reality really obvious in a particular place at a specific moment  and, get this, that place can be your life! When God's presence shines through you other people are drawn in.  So how do you get God's presence in your life? Well you can think of it like a biology lesson: the secret is in getting the roots of your life planted in God's soil. If you plant a seed in soil that has no nutrients and is really dry, the seed won't grow but if you plant a seed in good soil and water it regularly that seed will grow into the amazing plant God intended it to be. 
You're like that seed. If you spend time in God's Word, the Bible, which is jammed with 'God nutrients', then God's reality will begin to be transferred into you like a plant getting healthy from good soil. This will have a massive effect on how you live your life and the choices you make from day to day. Because you've packed yourself with 'God nutrients', when you have a tough day you will have His presence inside you to get through it and finish that day a winner! The more you allow His goodness to influence your life, the more your life will point others to Him. You're like a big billboard and people look at you. You can either be advertising Jesus or something not so cool. If you put your roots down in Him your life will show who Jesus really is. His goodness, His love and loads more!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A GOOD MAN [OR WOMAN] WILL OBTAIN FAVOUR FROM THE LORD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 12:2 NAS</span><br>Because God's blessings don't all look the same for everyone, we get the idea that He somehow gives special treatment to certain people. However, the Bible says He 'does not show favouritism' (Acts 10:34 NIV) so that can't be quite right. In the English New Testament the words grace and favour  both come from the Greek word, charis [gift] so when it says grace it could also mean favour. Think about it: when you ask somebody for a favour you're asking them for something you don't deserve. You're counting on their kindness and generosity when there's no obvious reason for them to do it, right?
Throughout the Bible God's grace/favour is what made it possible for 'nobodies' to do great things. For example, God chose a teenager called Esther to save her people and she stepped out in faith to approach the king, 'she obtained grace and favour in his sight' (Esther 2:17 AMP). God made a way for her to do the job He'd given her. Without God's grace/favour it's certain that Ruth, a Moabite woman, wouldn't have been accepted by the Israelites but because God had plans for her life and her heart was pure before Him, she ended up marrying Boaz, 'a man of great wealth' (Ruth 2:1 NKJV). And from their family line came King David and then Jesus! Pretty impressive huh?
David said, 'You bless the righteous; you surround them with your favour' (Psalm 5:12 NIV). When God approves of you, other people start favouring you too; often for reasons even they can't explain! Solomon said, 'A good man [or woman] will obtain favour from the Lord.' So ask for God's favour, expect it and live it out!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU...ENLARGED ME WHEN I WAS IN DISTRESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALMS 4:1 AMP</span><br>Did you know that the hermit crab looks for a shell that fits him, then lives in it 'til he outgrows it? After that he has to scurry along the ocean floor and find a bigger one; it's a process that repeats itself throughout his entire life. Are there things in your life that no longer fit you but you can't let go just because it's easy and familiar? David said, 'You...freed me when I was hemmed in and enlarged me when I was in distress.' To really grow in God you've got to be willing to get out of your comfort zone and deal with a little 'distress.' What worked for you yesterday may not work today. Maybe it's a club you've outgrown, a relationship you need to think about or a behaviour you need to change. Whatever it is, never become so 'settled' that you can't let go and move on when you need to. 
Sometimes it's good to be patient and see things through but there are times when those things are holding you back because you've outgrown them. Instead of hanging in and trying harder, at certain points you have to stop and ask yourself, 'Is this situation good for me?' If you're not sure, ask God for 'an understanding mind [to]...know the difference between...right and...wrong' (1 Kings 3:9 TLB). His Word says, 'If you need wisdom...ask [Him], and He will [gladly] give it to you' (James 1:5 NLT). When God says it's time to move on, it's because there's another shell out there that will fit you even better but you can't live in the new until you leave the old one. So how about it; are you ready for bigger things?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AND WE SHOULD NOT ENGAGE IN SEXUAL IMMORALITY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 10:8</span><br>One of the biggest things to deal with as a teenager is the issue of sex. It's everywhere you look. In advertising it's used to sell just about everything, it's on the TV, in magazines, on the radio and just about everywhere you can think of. Sometimes it can feel like you're the only person in the world not doing it and that pressure can be massive! 
Sex is a great thing that God made for people to enjoy but what's OK and what's not? How should a young person cope with the constant temptation? Well, temptation is hard to resist, especially when it's backed up by a rush of hormones. So watch out! Once you've crossed that line just a little, chances are next time you'll push it even further (many people disagree on where the 'line' is by the way). So how do you stop from crossing the line? Don't go near it until the time is right (ie. when you're married!). If you're not sure if it's OK or not, just don't go there. 
The truth of the matter is that God has given a set of guidelines to stop you getting hurt so claiming ignorance ('I didn't know whether that was allowed') is totally missing the point! Don't try to con yourself into thinking you haven't sinned due to a technicality; God knows your heart. Playing 'Let's see how close to the line we can go' isn't clever and it's not God's plan for you. So how far is too far? The answer is simple; just stay well away from the line. That may not be much fun now but one day you'll be glad you waited.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE SOUGHT HIS GOD AND WORKED WHOLEHEARTEDLY...SO HE PROSPERED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CHRONICLES 31:21 NIV</span><br>Let's get one thing straight: God doesn't want you to be a loser but you've got to do certain things: 
1) Set realistic goals. Think about what you can really manage and take it a bit at a time. One of the major reasons why many things fail is a lack of focus. So avoid distractions: 'A double minded man is unstable' (James 1:8). 
2) Set deadlines. Most people don't plan to fail, they just fail to plan! If you're not organised write things down. Above all, guard and watch your time. 'Use your head. Make the most of every chance you get' (Ephesians 5:16 TM). 
3) Do your homework. 'A wise man will hear and increase in learning' (Proverbs 1:5 NAS). If you'll pay for a hot CD but not a good book, you are showing that you value your pleasure more than your progress. Leaders are readers! 
4) Trust God. If He's given you a plan or a dream, trust Him even when things look bleak. Be positive and expectant that He's going to come through. 
5) Help others become successful. Don't expect everyone to support your dreams, plans and ideas if you don't support theirs!  'Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do' (Ephesians 6:8 NLT). That means sometimes you put others first! 
6) Put God first. You are His child, He wants you to succeed. What father wouldn't? So make a decision today to do everything you can to deepen your relationship with Him: 'Stop quarrelling with God...and things will go well for you' (Job 22:21 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FAITH IS THE REASON WE REMEMBER GREAT PEOPLE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:2 NCV</span><br>When the Bible says, 'Faith is the reason we remember great people,' maybe you think 'that settles it, I'll never be great'. However you might be surprised when you find out some of the people God bigs-up in Hebrews, Chapter 11.
Noah was a farmer-turned-boat-builder who got his name in lights because the boat he built survived the world's biggest ever flood. What we sometimes forget is that afterwards he got bladdered and disgraced his family! Abraham wasn't a prophet or a teacher; he was a wheeler-dealer with some character issues who tried to save his neck by lying and putting his wife in danger. Sarah, a housewife, laughed in God's face when He told her she'd give birth to a child at 90 years old (and you'd probably have done the same!). Then there's Rahab the hooker. How did somebody with her reputation ever become a woman of faith? You'll have to ask God; He included her on the list. How about Jacob the con artist? Would you like to do business with him? Of course there was David, who committed adultery which led to murder. And what about Gideon and Samuel, two big leaders whose children went right off the rails? 
The bottom line is that all these 'greats' were human just like us. In fact some of them would make us look like saints! You won't find any stained-glass material in this chapter. They messed up, screwed up and fell flat. The only thing they got right; they believed God and He honoured their faith!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN WE TRUST...HIM, WE'RE FREE...TO GO WHEREVER WE NEED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:12 TM</span><br>When you walk by faith God will test you like he tested Elijah! The prophet was sitting alone beside a dried-up stream when God sent him on a 100 mile hike through the desert to Zarephath. At the time Elijah was a wanted man, so coming out of hiding meant really trusting God for his safety. Next, God told him that when he got there a poor widow would provide for him. Elijah found the widow in the middle of a famine, cooking her last meal with her last bit of food; a bit depressing! Elijah challenged her to obey God, promising: 'There will always be plenty of flour and olive oil...in your containers until...the Lord sends rain and the crops grow' (1 Kings 17:14 NLT). Why on earth did Elijah have the confidence to say that to a skint widow during a famine? He had lived a life of faith and proved God to be faithful! You can talk that way when you walk that way!	
Rubbing shoulders with people who trust God is contagious, it builds your faith. This woman was no exception. She and her son may not have eaten slap up meals every night but God made sure that as long as the famine lasted they had all they needed. So if you don't have everything you want right now, give God what you've got and trust that when the time is right He'll look after you. Paul says, 'When we trust...him, we're free...to go wherever we need.' So wherever God is directing you, even if it's somewhere that doesn't make sense to you right now, don't argue. Go, because His promises depend on your obedience.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JOB...FELL TO THE GROUND AND WORSHIPED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOB 1:20 NAS</span><br>A few days ago we looked at Job and his attitude to having a seriously bad week. Every day God sends us opportunities to grow spiritually, disguised as problems! After losing his house, his children, his animals and his health, the Bible says, 'Job...fell to the ground and worshiped.' That's not the normal human response to tragedy, is it? Job didn't react that way because he understood what was happening or because he was nuts. No, he did it in spite of his circumstances! He was able to respond that way because: a) he looked inside! He knew that God was teaching him something really valuable and important: 'When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold' (Job 23:10). Job simply put his trust in God  b) he looked forward! He reminded himself that in the end it's all going to be OK when we stick with God c) he looked up! In the middle of a nightmare, Job saw the God who promised to direct each step we take. More importantly, he trusted God's heart of love and knew that as God, what happens is His call.
Don't make the mistake of thinking it was easier for Job to trust God than it is for you. Remember, Jesus hadn't even been born at that point so He didn't even have the same proof of God's love as we do! As humans we tend to go for what we know, even if it's rubbish. There's safety in the familiar even if it's boring but that's not God's plan for your life. So what should you do? Look in, look forward and most of all look upwards!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE...HOW CAN WE LOSE?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:31 TM</span><br>Faith is like a muscle; using it may cause a strain but in the end it grows stronger. David (the bloke who wrote all those Psalms and killed Goliath) totally understood this. He was always getting into trouble but instead of losing faith in God's promise, David understood that, 'The Lord has set apart [ear-marked] the godly man for Himself' (Psalm 4:3 NAS). So he said, 'In peace I will...lie down...For You...Lord, make me to dwell in safety' (Psalm 4:8 NAS). Even when he was captured by the Philistines he prayed, 'When I am afraid, I will...trust in You' (Psalm 56:3 NAS). When he ended up in a cave after legging it from a very angry King Saul he said, 'I will hide beneath the shadow of your wings until this...is past' (Psalm 57:1 TLB).	
During the third century, when St. Felix of Nola was running from his enemies, he hid in a cave. Eventually a spider began to weave a web across the small opening, sealing it off and making it look like nobody had been inside for months. As a result the guys hunting for him ran straight pass and didn't even bother to go in. Later, stepping out into the sunshine, Felix declared, 'Where God is, a spider's web is a wall. And where He isn't, a wall is but a spider's web.' Jesus said you'd have problems on earth; people will disappoint you and you'll disappoint yourself. Sometimes you'll end up in a cave because of something you did, other times because of circumstances you'd no control over but God is with you either way. Like Paul said, 'With God on our side ...how can we lose?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD MADE...ALL THE CREATURES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:25 NIV</span><br>While most people would agree that it's wrong to kill a cat or dog, many of us don't have a problem getting rid of those slightly lesser loved animals like flies or spiders! You see, the problem is that insects generally aren't very nice. We don't want them in our homes and certainly don't want them crawling on us but the question is, do we kill them or catch and release them? Does it really matter? People's views on this question will differ but there's one thing to remember; a person's views matter. You see it's our conscience that determines the answers to these questions and everyone's conscience differs. Sometimes it's according to your level of 'holiness' but sometimes you can simply really feel something is wrong! What you need to remember is when someone feels really strongly about something you don't think matters, respect their opinion, it's probably a God-given one! 
Throughout our lives God will transform and change our thinking and this includes the way we think about little things. For example, if something comes on the TV, you may suddenly get the feeling that it's not a good thing to watch. When this happens, turn it off! What's more, if someone else thinks it and you don't, remember it's not your place to set them straight and tell them they're being ridiculous. Show them some respect and turn the TV off. Live your life in a way that won't force others to feel embarrassed about their beliefs and if you get a little feeling something's wrong, don't ignore it. Be strong enough to turn over the TV and let the spider go, these things aren't worth falling out over!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JOB 1:21</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>'PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD</span><br>Six years ago today an historical event happened known globally as 9\11. Terrorist attacks on America left the world shaken as the Twin Towers fell to the ground in New York City. As we remember those who lost their lives, the first question we ask is 'God, why did this happen?' It's times like this that our faith is shaken or strengthened. We all know the easy answer that we have free will, we're free to make our own choices and that day, those men chose to hijack those planes but there's not much comfort in that answer. 
In the book of Job, we see similar questions asked. Job was a top guy with a great life who loved God a lot and God loved him back but Job was tested; it's easy to worship God when life's good but what about when it's not going so smoothly? Job lost his animals, his farm, his servants and even his sons and daughters. Even so, Job was able to say 'The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised.' How many of us say that?! You see, even though we may not want to hear it, the fact is that God IS good. Whatever we go through God still loves us. He never leaves us and proved that by sending us Jesus. Whatever we go through He still laid down his life for us! So remember, as we think of those who lost their lives six years ago remember, God IS good and still deserves all the honour and praise.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT BE AFRAID OF SUDDEN FEAR.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:25 NAS</span><br>There are times when life throws something at you that's really scary. For some people it's exams, for others it's spiders and for others it's public speaking. The fear-factor that comes with these things has physical effects: you can't breathe, your palms sweat, your chest gets tight, you feel weak... If you recognise these symptoms, you're not alone! Every year almost one in three people have a panic attack. What's the answer? The Bible says: 'Do not...panic...The Lord shall be your confidence' (Pr 3:25 AMP). Here are some tips you can use to help:
1) Breathe: Panic makes you breathe in short, shallow bursts but breathing deeply helps to calm and relax you. Remember, 'He himself gives all men life and breath' (Acts 17:25 NIV). So when you start to feel overwhelmed just breathe the Name of Jesus. 
2) Don't panic about feeling panicked! If you do, you'll end up in double-trouble. An old American president once said, 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.' It's one thing to realise that you're scared but don't add that to your list of worries. It's possible to allow yourself to feel fear without reacting to it and it will help to break the cycle too. 
3) Distract yourself: Panic makes you think thoughts that feed your fear so you need to get your mind onto something completely different. Whisper a prayer, quote a verse, listen to some music or talk to a friend. If your panic continues to be an ongoing issue there's no shame in getting professional help. After all, it's God who gives doctors the wisdom to help. So take action today and don't let panic control you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:9 NIV</span><br>In this world full of conflict you have to take sides. You have two options; you can be a troublemaker or a peacemaker! You can add to the stress or you can bring a solution. Check this out: A little guy was confronted by three bullies, any one of whom could have flattened him and that's what they had in mind but even though the guy was small he was a quick thinker. He backed off, drew a line in the dirt and then backed up a few more steps. In a statement that sounded like suicide he looked into the eyes of the biggest of the three and said, 'Now, you just step across that line!' The big bully did. At that moment the little guy grinned and said, 'Good, now we're both on the same side!'
Peacemakers look for common ground and try to get everyone onto it. Their goal is to find a win-win situation. Barnabas, whose name means 'Son of encouragement,' looked out for the newly converted Paul until he'd got rid of his dangerous reputation as an enemy of Christians. Given Paul's track record, who could blame them? Barnabas wasn't looking at Paul's troubled past; he was thinking about his potential and his risk paid off big time. Saul the persecutor soon became Paul the apostle! Barnabas had to put his credibility on the line for this to happen. Peacemaking means taking a risk on people, judging them by their best moments rather than their worst. Here's another way to think about it; peacemakers see right through petty personal opinions or tedious temporary conditions; they're governed by grace. So, are you ready to be a peacemaker?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FAN INTO FLAME THE GIFT OF GOD, WHICH IS IN YOU</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIM 1:6 NIV</span><br>Right at the beginning of time God made all that we see in a sequence of amazing creative acts. Have you ever thought that when He made the living things, everything from oak trees to orang-utans, He made them full of potential? Not one of the living things we will find on the face of the earth simply appears by magic in its finished form and then disappears again without rhyme or reason. No, everything has a cycle of growth and everything has the potential to multiply. The thing that sets us apart from every other living thing on the face of the earth is that our potential is not just biological; there's a bigger reason for us being here! In your life there is spiritual potential. That means there are promises and possibilities stored up for you to discover. Jesus makes this really clear 'Everything is possible for him who believes' (Mark 9:23) and Peter adds, 'He has given us His very great and precious promises' (2 Peter 1:4). 
Sometimes we can have tunnel vision when it comes to considering what God may be calling us into. Our ideas can get very rigid and we start to lose any sense of flexibility. If we learn anything from looking at the way God has journeyed with his creation since those original mighty acts it is this; God gives the potential and then offers the freedom it needs to be worked out. The question is how are you using that freedom? Are you taking every opportunity to become the radical disciple you were created to be? If not; why not?!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'VE RUN HARD RIGHT TO THE FINISH, BELIEVED ALL THE WAY. ALL THAT'S LEFT NOW IS...GOD'S APPLAUSE!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;> 2 TIMOTHY 4:7 TM</span><br>Young people tend to live more spontaneous lives than those who are older. Full of energy, looking out for new experiences, with few responsibilities; no wonder so many old people if they had one wish would choose to be young again. We will all change over time and as we do knowing certain things in advance will help, for example:  
1) Aging isn't optional but being 'old' is. You can keep a youthful attitude by staying open to new ideas and remembering that you can learn something new every day. 
2) Time is a gift. David said, 'Teach us to use wisely all the time we have' (Psalm 90:12 CEV). So much of life is wasted doing things that don't count for anything. How much of your typical day is just wasted time? What can you do about it? 
3) Testing times will come. Don't be surprised if you have difficult, painful or stressful situations to go through. Don't let these times make you angry or bitter. Bad health, busted relationships and broken dreams can actually bring about beauty in our lives if we let God teach us how to respond. 
4) Laughter revives the soul. You might be fit or foxy now, turning heads as you walk down the street but when Mother Nature and Father Time get through with you, a well-developed sense of humour will come in handy every time you look in the mirror! Since 'A cheerful heart is good medicine' (Proverbs 17:22 NLT), make sure you approach every day with a sense of fun. Put these things into practice now and you stand a much better chance of going the distance.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A LAND IN WHICH YOU...SHALL...LACK NOTHING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 8:9 AMP</span><br>When God delivered the Israelites from slavery He did it in stages:
First: He brought them out of the land of 'not enough.' As slaves in Egypt without power, they were forced to depend on Pharaoh for everything. When you have to keep relying on anyone but God, you're not really free. God won't allow you to get 'hooked' on anybody but Him. Elijah was living happily by a stream in the middle of a famine. Ravens brought him meat each day. What an arrangement! One day the ravens didn't show up and the brook dried up. What happened? God dried up the brook to drive him back to the source! Regardless of whom God uses He alone is the source of all you need. 
Second: He brought them through the wilderness of 'just enough.' God provided them with heavenly food, manna, just enough for each day. Now it's no fun struggling to barely get by. We tend to appreciate what we had to struggle for and we learn to trust God more. Plus, living through seasons of 'just enough' builds into us an instinct to keep moving on to better things.
Third: He brought them into the land of 'more than enough.' God described Israel's future home as 'a land in which you shall lack nothing.' God's ultimate goal for you is abundance, in all areas of life! Is that so you'll have more than the next guy? No! God told Abraham, 'I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing' (Gen 12:2 NIV). 'More than enough' means never having an excuse not to help those in need.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEN I WILL TEACH TRANSGRESSORS YOUR WAYS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:13 NIV</span><br>The story goes that Roger Simms was hitchhiking home when he was picked up by Mr. Hanover. As they drove towards Chicago, Roger felt God urging him to share his faith. When he overcame his fear and asked the man if he would like to become a Christian, Mr. Hanover stopped, bowed his head on the steering wheel, began to cry and accepted Jesus. 'This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me,' he said. Shortly afterwards he dropped Roger at his house and went on to Chicago, which was about an hour down the road. Years later, while preparing for a business trip to Chicago, Roger came across the gold-embossed business card Mr. Hanover had given him years earlier. When he arrived in Chicago he decided to look up Hanover Enterprises and found it located in a skyscraper down town. When he asked the receptionist if he could see Mr. Hanover, she said, 'No, but his wife is here.' 'You knew my husband?' the woman in her 50's asked. Roger explained that her husband had given him a ride and how he'd led him to Christ. 'When was that?' she asked. 'May 7th, five years ago, the day I was discharged from the army.' She began to sob. After several minutes she regained control and said, 'I prayed for my husband's salvation for years, believing God would save him. But right after he let you out of his car, on May 7th, he was killed in a head-on collision. I thought God had not answered my prayer, and I stopped living for Him five years ago.' That day she recommitted her life to Christ. Share your faith; somebody needs it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BY HIS WOUNDS WE ARE HEALED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 53:5 NIV</span><br>Max Lucado writes: 'I received a call from a friend named Kenny. He'd just returned from Disneyworld. &quot;I saw a sight I'll never forget,&quot; he said. He and his family were in Cinderella's castle. Suddenly all the children rushed to one side...Cinderella had entered. She stood waist-deep in kids, each wanting to be touched. Kenny turned toward the other side of the castle. It was now vacant, except for a boy; his age was hard to determine because of the disfigurement of his body...he stood watching...longing to be in the middle of the kids reaching for Cinderella. But can't you feel his fear; fear of yet another rejection? Fear of being...mocked again? Don't you wish Cinderella would go to him? Guess what? She did! She walked across the floor, knelt at eye level with the stunned little boy and placed a kiss on his cheek. &quot;I thought you would appreciate the story,&quot; Kenny told me. 
'I did. It reminded me of another one. The names are different, but isn't the story the same? Rather than a princess of Disney, it's the Prince of Peace. Rather than a boy in a castle, it's a thief on a cross. In both cases a gift was given. In both cases love was shared. In both cases the lovely one performed a gesture beyond words. But Jesus did more than Cinderella. Cinderella gave only a kiss. When she stood to leave she took her beauty with her. The boy was still deformed. What if Cinderella had done what Jesus did? What if she assumed His state? What if she had somehow given her beauty and taken on his disfigurement?' That's what Jesus did for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ARE YOU NOT RULER OVER ALL...OF THE NATIONS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CHRONICLES 20:6 NAS</span><br>The country we call 'home,' exists only by God's permission and power. 'He made from one man every nation...having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation' (Acts 17:26 NAS). Politicians can draw all the maps they want but they aren't worth the paper they're printed on because God is not constrained by any border or boundary. Leaders don't determine the future of countries; God determines the hearts of leaders. 'The king's heart is like a stream of water directed by the Lord; he guides it wherever he pleases' (Proverbs 21:1 NLT). The stubborn will of the most powerful president can be directed by God as easily as a farmer reroutes a shallow ditch on his farm.
The Old Testament tells of Cyrus, the powerful King of Persia (Iraq). When God wanted the Jews to return to Jerusalem He simply prodded him to make an 'official announcement' (Ezra 1:1 TM). Earlier in their history God had not only set the Israelites free from 400 years of slavery in Egypt, He caused their captors to equip them with supplies. '[They will] load you down with gifts...so...you will [not leave] empty- handed' (Ex 3:21 TLB). 
If we enjoy a great economy, personal freedom and good education, we shouldn't limit our thanks to politicians. No, we thank God: 'He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them' (Job 12:23 NIV). Look behind the headlines; God has a plan for the Earth's rebellious nations. He makes and breaks leaders and so we should continue to passionately pray, 'Your Kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR THE REVELATION AWAITS AN APPOINTED TIME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 2:3 NIV</span><br>When God speaks to you it's not always wise to rush out and tell people. Actually, it can often be totally the wrong thing to do! When God gives you a word of direction it's often followed by a season of preparation. So don't go broadcasting your latest big revelation until God gives you the green light. Why? 
You need time, maturing and equipping, so that the word you've received can take root and be fulfilled in the way God wants. Look at the example of the Apostle Paul; after the amazing vision of Jesus he had on the Damascus Road he started spouting off about his experience and very quickly it got him into trouble (see Acts 9:20-31).  It wasn't the right time for doing that. Paul writes, 'Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem... But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders...' (Galatians 2:1-2 NIV). Paul had the wisdom to know that people would find his calling unbelievable. So he waited; a very long time! He allowed God to go ahead of him and arrange the circumstances in his favour. While he was waiting, he allowed the word he had received to grow in his heart and make changes in his life. Then and only then did he start doing what he was called to do. Paul didn't try to convince anybody, he let God do that. The result? 'Their response was to recognise and worship God because of me' (Galatians 1:24 TM). So don't get ahead of God's plan for your life. Don't let your mouth make its own decisions; be sensitive to God's timing!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HIS ANOINTING TEACHES YOU CONCERNING EVERYTHING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 2:27 AMP</span><br>We need to have an attitude that says, 'God, no matter what anyone else is telling me, or what I think myself, if I clearly hear You saying something to me I'm going to honour You and do what You say.' If we pray and hear something from God but then start asking everybody else what they think, we're putting human opinions above God's. This will stop us from developing the trust that is essential for any relationship to exist long term. Okay, some decisions are really big and we need to be sure we've heard God right but at the end of the day we need to trust God to show us the way. Listen, 'His anointing teaches you concerning everything...' (1 John 2:27 AMP). The Apostle John wrote this verse as part of a warning he was giving to young Christians; he wanted them to be really careful who they listened to because at that time a lot of false teachers were leading people astray. He wanted them to know that God gives his Spirit as a guide and direct our lives. We might ask more mature Christians for advice but we must not blindly follow other people.
If we are ever going to develop the ability to hear from God and be led by His Spirit, we have to start making our own decisions and trust the wisdom God has deposited in our heart. The devil wants us to think we're not capable of hearing from God. Don't buy it! The Holy Spirit that dwells inside you will give you confidence, comfort and counsel for your life. So, learn to listen to Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 46:10</span><br>If you're unwilling to listen to God in one area, you'll be unable to hear from Him in other areas. People think they can't hear from God but in reality there are a lot of things they already know He wants them to respond to but they just haven't done them. The more quickly you do whatever it is the Lord tells you to do, the more quickly He reveals the next step for you to take.Hearing from God must be developed by practice; especially if you're a talker! That's why He says, 'Be still and know that I am God.' Most of us are full of energy and want to be active doing something, so it can be difficult for us to be still. Don't just talk to God when you want or need something; spend time with Him; listening! He'll open up many issues if you'll just be still before Him. You say, 'But I don't think I've ever heard God talk to me!' Could it be that you haven't learned to listen? When you ask God for something, it's time to tune your 'receiver.' Even if He doesn't respond at that moment, He will in time. You may be doing something very ordinary when He decides to speak but if you have made listening part of your Christian walk, He'll speak to you at exactly the right time. Maybe you've wasted years going your own way, doing your own thing. It's not too late to go in a new direction. If you're willing to obey God, He'll begin an exciting conversation which will flow between you and Him every day of your life. What's stopping you?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE WILL BE OUR GUIDE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 48:14 NIV</span><br>Jesus told His disciples, 'The Spirit of truth (the Truth-giving Spirit)...will guide you into all the Truth (the whole, full Truth)' (John 16:13 AMP). Jesus spoke these words to men with whom He'd spent the previous three years. Now you'd think that if Jesus was with us personally for three years, day and night, we'd have learned all there is to know but Jesus said to expect more because He will always have something to say to us about each new situation we are facing. God wants to speak to you on a one-to-one basis. He wants to lead you step by step into the good things He has in store for you. He cares about the tiniest details of your life. Never hesitate to take what you think are small things to God; after all, everything is small to God! He even keeps track of how many hairs you have on your head (see Matthew 10:30). He cares about the desires of your heart. He wants to reveal truth to you that will set you free from worry, fear and limitation. His plan to share an intimate relationship with you existed before you were even born. The Psalmist said, 'All the days [of my life] were written before ever they took shape' (Psalm 139:16 AMP). Paul said that God 'determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek him' (Acts 17:26-27 NIV). It's not rocket science but if God plans all of our days and where we're going to live before we're even born, then it makes sense for us to learn how to hear from Him. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAY YOUR ROOTS GO DOWN DEEP INTO THE SOIL OF GOD'S MARVELLOUS LOVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:17 TLB</span><br>Difficulties, hardship, and tough times; no one looks forward to them but they make us strong! Philip Gulley writes, 'Growing up I had an old neighbour named Dr. Gibbs. When he wasn't saving lives he was planting trees. The good doctor had some interesting theories ... He came from the 'no pain, no gain' school of horticulture. He never watered his new trees. He said watering plants spoiled them; if you water them, each successive generation will grow weaker. So you have to make things tough for them and weed out the weenie trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't 
watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. He'd plant an oak, and instead of watering it, every morning he'd beat it with a rolled up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! He said it made the trees pay attention. Dr. Gibbs went to glory a couple of years after I left 
home. Every now and again I'd walk by his house and look at those trees he planted twenty-five years ago. They are granite strong, big and robust. They wake up every morning and beat their chests and drink their coffee black. I planted a couple of trees a few years back. 
Carried water to them for a solid summer, sprayed them, and prayed over them. Three years of coddling has resulted in trees that expect to be waited on hand and foot. Whenever a cold wind blows in, they tremble. Sissy trees. Funny thing about those trees of Dr. Gibbs. Adversity seems to have benefited them in ways comfort and ease never could.' ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET THE PEACE OF CHRIST RULE IN YOUR HEARTS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:15 NIV</span><br>When God speaks to us He gives us a deep sense of inner peace to confirm that He is speaking to us. Beware of false peace! When we have a strong desire to do something it can produce a strong emotion but it's a lot more to do with our own excitement than God's peace. As time passes this false peace disappears and God's 'true will' emerges for our lives. So we should never move too quickly on important decisions. 
When the devil speaks to us he can't give us peace and when we just try to sort things out in our own minds, we can't get peace. 'But to be spirituality minded is life and peace' (see Romans 8:6 NKJ). Made a decision?  Does your own thinking or even the ideas of others outweigh your inner peace? Hold back! You don't have to explain to others why you don't have peace about it; sometimes you won't know why. Just say, 'It's not wise for me to do this because I don't have peace about it.' There's power in having peace! Once you know you've heard from God do all you can to 'keep your peace' and not worry. Peace is an inner 'knowing' that your actions are approved by God. 'Let the peace (soul harmony which comes) from Christ rule (act as umpire continually) in your hearts [deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds, in that peaceful state] to which...you were also called [to live] (Colossians 3:15 AMP). God leads us by peace. His 
peace is like a tennis umpire who decides what's 'in' and what's 'out.' No peace? It's 'out.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANYONE HEARS MY VOICE AND OPENS THE DOOR, I WILL COME IN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 3:20 NIV</span><br>Max Lucado writes: 'Ever wonder why there were two crosses next to Christ? Or why Jesus was in the centre? Those two crosses symbolise one of God's greatest gifts; the gift of choice. The two criminals have much in common; convicted by the same system, condemned to the same death, surrounded by the same crowd, and equally close to the same Christ. In fact, they began with the same sarcasm; the two criminals each said cruel things to Jesus. But one changed. He said, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.' Jesus answered him, 'I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise' (Luke 23:42-43 NIV). While we rejoice at the thief who changed, we dare not forget the one who didn't. There are times when God sends thunder to stir 
us. There are times when God sends blessings to lure us. But there are times when God sends nothing but silence, as He honours us with the freedom to choose where we spend eternity. We have never been given a greater privilege than that of choice. Think about the thief who repented. Though we know little about him, we know this: in the end, all his bad choices were redeemed by a solitary good choice. He chose Christ!' No matter how many bad choices you may have made in your past, you can be rescued by one good choice; the choice to give your life to Christ and follow Him. Will you make that choice now? If you do you'll never ever regret it. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SERVING THE LORD, NOT MEN, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THE LORD WILL</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:7-8 NIV</span><br>The Bible talks a lot about sowing and reaping. When you are still in bed dreaming about being Becks or being married to Becks, farmers are out on their tractors ploughing fields. When he sows the seeds he expects to see a crop for this work. When we invest in something or someone it's only human to feel we should reap where we've sown. When we don't, it's easy to get upset. Yet the Bible says, 'Serve whole-
heartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does.' (Ephesians 6:7-8 NIV). Nobody knows the sacrifices you've made better than God. He sees your secret and selfless acts on behalf of others and His Word says, 'Then your father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.' (Matthew 6:4). Now if God chooses to reward you richly, don't let anybody make you feel bad about it. Just keep giving your best and keep serving, regardless of what He puts into your hand or how 
much praise and recognition you receive or don't receive. In the book of Matthew, Jesus tells a story of a boss who gives his workers a job to do, later he rewards their efforts. They aren't given the same responsibilities or the same rewards (Matthew 25).  Your part is to be grateful for whatever He gives you, do the best job you can and enjoy the rewards and greater opportunities that follow. Remember, you're not serving so people will big you up but so that God Himself with say 'well done' (Matthew 25:21). Go for it! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SO JOSHUA DID AS MOSES HAD SAID TO HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 17:10</span><br>If you've got a job or you help out at church or even just have chores around the house, think about Joshua. Josh served Moses, doing what Moses said but looked only to God for his reward. Your boss may pay you but he doesn't decide your future; God does that! So what difference does that make? It means no job God gives you will ever be beneath you! When you pray 'God, use me,' He may well ask you to serve someone else. If you make the mistake of looking to that person for your reward and it doesn't come, you'll feel used and resentful. It's God who sets the rules for you. God's the one who requires you to honour Him by serving with submission (that means not moaning, groaning and giving it loads of attitude) and excellence. He's the one who calls you to give the best you can. He's the one who says it's not okay to always turn up late and grumpy; or wait until your mum has asked you ten times before you get round to taking the bin out!  Remember God rewards us according to our service; not what others think we're worth. Sometimes we can be busy and wanting to be bigged up by people but we are not serving them. Stop striving and get back to serving! Listen, 'God is not unjust; He will not forget your work...' (Hebrews 6:10 NIV). Be encouraged; 
whatever tasks you face today remember that God records and God rewards; that should be enough for you!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When I was a child.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV</span><br>A well-known Bible teacher says, 'As a new Christian...I tried to become what I thought all Christians were...I thought they'd mastered a level of holiness that seemed to elude me. I admired those 'faith heroes' whose flowery testimonies hung around the ceiling like steam 
gathering in a shower. They seemed so changed, so sure, so stable...I thought God's love was doled out according to a merit system. If I did well today, God loved me...if I failed, He didn't. What a roller-coaster ride!...I didn't realise everything that's born has to grow and 
develop to maturity. I was expecting an immediate, powerful, all-inclusive metamorphosis that would transform me into...perfection.' Do you feel that way? Like there's something wrong with you because you never seem to measure up? Paul says, 'When we were children, we...reasoned as children...But when we grew up, we quit our childish ways.' Every Christian starts out as a child needing time and training to grow up. It's cool to want to be holy but putting on a front trying to impress others is pointless. It'll stop you from being honest before God or with your leaders. You can only grow when you are honest about where you are at. Remember when you were a child and you dressed up in 
your Mum's high heels or your Dad's work boots? No matter how much you wanted them to fit, they didn't look right. That didn't mean there was something wrong with you; it just meant you were exactly where you should have been for your age. It's the same in your walk with God. It's important to give Him time to mature you. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Before I formed you...I...approved of you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 1:5 AMP</span><br>Spiritually speaking, you're probably not as far along the road as you'd like to be; but thank God you're still on the road! At one time you were a stranger to God's unstoppable unconditional love, now your part of the family! Paul writes: 'You received the word...not as 
the word of men, but...the word of God, which... effectively works in you who believe' (1Thessalonians 2:13 NKJ). Did you get that? As long as you keep believing it, God's Word will keep working in you. Plus, you'll mature faster when you stop being so hard on yourself, learn to relax and start living by what God's Word says about you; not how you feel!How you see yourself affects your spiritual progress. Until the way you see yourself lines up with God's view of you, as revealed in His Word, you'll keep seeing yourself as inferior and unworthy and that will hold back your spiritual growth. Nobody knows you like God does. And in spite of your struggles and stumbling, He loves and accepts you just as you are. God told Jeremiah, 'Before I formed you...I knew...and approved of you.' Stop worrying about being rejected when you don't 'perform' perfectly. The world operates like that but not God. Plus, if you were as perfect as you'd like to be you wouldn't need His grace, right? Check out Genesis 32:22 and read about Jacob's limp, sometimes God leaves weaknesses in us to remind us how much we need Him each day. So enjoy where you are now and don't compare yourself with other people. Don't worry if they're further along than you. They went 
through the same places to get to where they are today. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AS THE SPIRIT...WORKS WITHIN US, WE BECOME...LIKE HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 </span><br>Are you pushing to become more like Jesus but some days it feels like two steps forward and three back? Growing up spiritually isn't easy; that's why Paul encourages us not to 'let ourselves lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary'(Galatians 6:9 NAS). You don't notice yourself growing older physically 'til you look at an earlier photo, then it hits you. It's the same with spiritual growth; it's hard to gauge how far you've come 'til you look back and see where you were before Jesus saved you and turned your life around. The Bible says, 'As the Spirit...works within us, we become more...like him,' but growing up involves growing pains! Also, you must never forget that you're on a spiritual journey, you're going places and you're making progress. While ever you're on the highway of holiness the devil will be looking for ways to distract you and divert you or he'll try to dishearten you by pointing out how far you still have to go. Don't listen to him and don't give up! Jesus said: '...there is no truth in him... he is a liar and the father of lies and all that is false' (John 8:44 AMP). If you get discouraged and give up, satan wins. Paul says, 'lead every thought and purpose away 
captive into the obedience of Christ' (See 2 Corinthians 10:5 AMP). Learn to live beyond your feelings, to dig down inside to where God's Spirit lives. Take heart! It may not always feel like it but every day you're maturing and growing stronger in Christ. So don't even think 
about throwing in the towel! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU THE LAND, AND HE WILL MAKE SURE YOU </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 28:8</span><br>When you're young person, a big thing you want to get sorted is a job. Whether it's your future career or a Saturday job in the local shop, the Bible tells us how we can be happy in our work: a) see work as God's gift, not punishment. 'When God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work - this is a gift of God' (Ecclesiastes 5:19 NIV) b) recognise God as your true boss. 'Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does' (Ephesians 6:7-8 NIV) c) look for work that matches your gifts. 'If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised' (1 Peter 4:11 NIV) d) learn everything possible about your job. 'Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance' (Proverbs 1:5 NIV) e) use criticism to your advantage. In fact, make it work for you; ask for suggestions and correction: 'A man's riches may ransom his life, but a poor man hears no threat' (Proverbs 13:18 NIV) f) do more than is expected of you. 'If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles' (Matthew 5:41 
NIV). Be an extra-miler! g) make Jesus your work mate. Keep thinking about Jesus throughout the day as you get on will the job the best you can: 'People with their minds set on you, you keep completely whole' (Isaiah 26:3 TM).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD GOD HAS GIVEN ME HIS WORDS OF WISDOM SO THAT I MAY KNOW </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 50:4 TLB</span><br>Wisdom is a funny old thing. It's supposed to come with age but often doesn't. It supposed to come with experience but it doesn't always. The reason it comes with age is because you mature over time but that just means you begin to realise you're not perfect and you don't need to be old to know that! You get wisdom through experience because you learn from your mistakes but: a) you don't always learn and b) you can easily learn from other people's mistakes! Wisdom is about understanding who you are, what you're good at, accepting other people; and knowing they're not perfect and putting all that understanding into practice! Being wise isn't like being The Oracle, an all-knowing spooky person who knows exactly what's going on in one glance. Much of it is about knowing when to speak and when to simply keep your mouth shut. You'd be surprised how often the best thing is to simply stay quiet and wait for the right moment to speak! Here are two things to try when giving out wisdom: 1) You may have the best answer in the world to someone's problem but if you take the 'ram-it-down-their-throat' approach you'll only upset them! Good ideas are wasted when you use a 'ram-it-down-their-throat' approach. You've got to learn how to say the right thing, the right way. 2) You won't be able to help a soul unless you love the person you're speaking to. If you love them you'll approach them in a sensitive way, in the right time and with a lot of understanding. Without love, no one will care what you think! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL WRITE ON HIM THE NAME OF MY GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 3:12 NIV</span><br>In the Bible and still in many cultures today, names are given for more reasons other than just because it sounded nice. Often there were times in the Bible when people were given a name as a child and God totally changed their name to fit what He had planned for them. Maybe you're like Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. No idea who they are? In the Bible King Nebuchadnezzer renamed them Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. When the King made a giant golden statue of himself, these guys refused to bow down and worship it. The names Nebuchadnezzer gave them were all pagan names which express worship to idols. The real names of the three Hebrew children were; Hananiah, meaning 'Jehovah is gracious'; Mishael, 
meaning 'Who is like God'; and Azariah, meaning 'Jehovah has helped.' When they refused to bow down the King threw them into a fiery furnace but it was the names God gave them that came through. There's nothing like trouble to bring out your true identity! Can you imagine these boys shouting when they came out of the fiery furnace? One would say, 'Who is like God?' Another would lift his hands and shout, 'Jehovah is gracious!' The other would smell his clothes, touch his hair and declare, 'Jehovah has helped!' The King tried to change the name on the package but he couldn't change what was on the inside. God has given you a similar identity as His child. Whatever others may say, You are whom your Heavenly Father says you are. Whatever you may be called, whatever labels and words people call you, they can't change who you really are. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO IS IT HE IS TRYING TO TEACH CHILDREN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 28:9 NIV</span><br>Have a think about the person you admire most. Is it someone you know well or someone famous? The chances are it's someone you know. Not some distant character we read about in Hello magazine. Our true heroes, the people we look up to and secretly want to be like are usually people who are right on our doorstep. It may be a friend's older brother or sister, your youth leader, maybe a worship leader or maybe it's just a friend. We all have heroes and the chances are that even you are somebody's hero! Maybe it's the little kid down the street who you always stop to talk to or the kid who always gets picked on by the others but you've always got a smile for. Maybe it's just a friend who knows you're always there. 
When we have heroes, it's easy to think they're better than us and they can do no wrong. That's fine until they have a bad day and can't be bothered to speak or even use you as a punch bag. Harsh words from someone you admire can have a huge and hurtful affect, much more than anyone else's comment!
Having a hero is not a bad thing but here's two things to remember; 1) if you're someone's hero, try not to let them down. You're in a position to have a positive and even life-changing effect on that person with just a few words; use it wisely! 2) your hero is still human, they're not perfect. Do your best to study Jesus, He was a true hero and the only one worth copying 100%. What's even better is He  wants to get to know you more today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD IS VERY PRESENT...IN TROUBLE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 46:1</span><br>In a dream, a man once saw Jesus approach three praying women. He knelt beside the first with great tenderness and love. At the second, He just placed His hand on her head and gave her a look of approval. He passed by the third without even stopping. The dreaming man was totally confused so Jesus explained, 'Without constant assurance, the first woman would stumble and fall. The second woman?s faith is stronger; I can count on her. But the third, is being trained for the highest calling of all. She knows me so well that she doesn?t need a pat on the back or special attention. Life doesn't get to her because she knows that ultimately she can trust me.' 
Being sinful, we fail. Being human, we hurt. Being mortal, we die. Pressure wears us down. Stress gives us headaches. People scare us. Criticism offends us. Disease worries us. Death haunts us. What's the answer? 'God is 'very present in trouble' (Psalm 46:1). Never doubt in the dark what God told you in the light. He is with you day by day on your journey; this amazing God has everything under control and without you seeing or understanding, every detail He has planned will happen to perfection. When we hit rough spots, our reaction is to feel abandoned yet the opposite is true, 'cos at that moment we're more than ever the object of His love and concern. Yes, even when our vision gets blurred, our thinking foggy and we look up and think He's vanished, He is there! Don't ever forget that.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 11:24 NIV</span><br>When a severe drought hit a small farming community, a local church called a prayer meeting and everybody showed up. Crisis has a way of getting our attention! As the pastor stood before his packed church he noticed an 11-year-old girl sitting in the front row, beaming with excitement. Lying next to her was her bright red umbrella all ready for use. The beauty and innocence of this sight made him smile as he compared the faith of this child with everyone else in the room. You see, the rest of them had just come to pray for rain ? she had come to see God answer!
Why do we waste so many words by praying but not actually expecting an answer!? 'Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that?He rewards those who earnestly seek Him? (Heb11:6 NIV). How do you get more faith? By filling your mind with the Bible! ?Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God? (Ro 10:17). When you soak yourself in God?s Word an amazing thing happens; faith takes root and begins to grow. And faith is what makes your praying effective. 
What if your prayer is in line with the Bible and seems as if God should answer but it's taking a really long time? Just keep praying and believing! ?Do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised? (Heb 10:35-36 NIV). So from now on, when you pray, make sure you remember that red umbrella!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Preserve my life according to Your Word.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:37 NIV</span><br>You?d think that applying the Bible would be fairly simple, but actually it?s the hardest part of Bible study. Why? Because: 
(1) It takes some serious thinking. Sometimes it takes a long session of in-depth, prayerful thinking before we figure out how God wants us to live. Often this means digging under the surface of an ancient story til you get to a very up-to-date way of living it out. (2) Satan fights it. The devil?s strongest attacks often come in your quiet time, when you?re trying to apply what you?ve studied. As soon as you get serious about making changes, Satan will fight you all the way. He hates ?doers? of the Word. He doesn?t mind you studying your Bible as long as you don?t stop to ask, ?Now, what am I going to do with what I?ve learned?? (3) We naturally resist change. We don?t ?feel? like changing; it's not fun but it's what we need to do to really live our lives God-style. We live by our emotions rather than our decision. We say stuff like, ?I don?t feel like studying the Bible, or praying, or worshipping.? Feelings are unreliable; they come and go. The key to spiritual maturity is to live for Jesus not because we feel good, but because (a) it?s the right thing to do; (b) God expects it of us; (c) it?s the way to get mature in God; (d) it?s the only way you'll ever have a stable Christiam life always going in the right direction!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Preserve my life according to Your Word.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:37 NIV</span><br>Understand these facts:
(1) Bible study can be dangerous if you merely study it without applying it. ?Knowledge puffs up? (1 Co 8:1 NIV). This Greek word ?puffs? contains the idea of being inflated, like a hot-air balloon. Ouch! Satan knew the Scriptures so well that he could quote them to Jesus in the wilderness temptation. And what is Satan?s chief quality? Pride! It got him kicked out of heaven. Studying the Scriptures should keep you humble, dependent on God, and give you the right approach to life. (2) Knowledge must lead to action. God doesn?t suggest things. He doesn?t say, ?Please, won?t you consider doing this?? or &quot;It would be nice if you did this&quot;. Jesus said, ?Everyone who hears these words of Mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock? (Mt 7:24 NIV). When the storms of life came, the wise man?s life stood firm while the foolish man?s ? the one who didn?t practice what he knew ? came crashing down. (3) Knowledge increases your responsibility. In the Spider-man movie Uncle Ben said to Spider-man 'With great power comes great responsibility&quot; and the same is true of the Bible. If you?re serious about studying your Bible, you?ll have greater knowledge and you're then expected to put that into practice. ?Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn?t do it, sins? (Jas 4:17 NIV). So, if you?re not planning on applying the lessons you receive from your Bible study, you?d be better not to study it at all. You?re just heaping up more judgment for yourself! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Preserve my life according to Your Word.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:37 NIV</span><br>The Bible is like a cave full of treasure; amd you'll never reach its end. The book of Psalms says ?To all perfection I see a limit; but Your commands are boundless? (Ps 119:96 NIV). Solomon said, ?If you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear [deep respect, and submission] of the Lord and find the knowledge of God? (Pr 2:4-5 NIV). When it comes to God?s Word, you'll be amazed by how much is in a few small words. This is why you can study the same Scripture over and over again, leave it for a month and when you come back to it there is much more to find. 
The key is this: stick with it! Remember, there is no limit to the number of questions you can ask, no limit to the observations you can make, no limit to the applications you can make. So don?t give up! The best attitude to have in Bible study is the one Jacob had when he wrestled with the angel of the Lord. He tightened his grip and said, ?I will not let you go unless you bless me? (Ge 32:26 NIV). And the result? His life was changed. And yours will be too! 
Bible study has no shortcuts! It?s hard work. But if you are diligent and patient you will reap great rewards. Once you have felt the joy and satisfaction that comes from finding a great Spiritual truth on your own, then applying it to your life, you will never approach your Bible the same way again!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Preserve my life according to Your Word.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:37 NIV</span><br>A lad was in need of direction, so he tried a bit of Bible Bingo (that is when you open it at random and point at a verse). He opened it at this verse: ?Judas went out and hanged himself.? Quickly he closed it and reopened it elsewhere only to hit a verse saying: ?Go thou and do likewise.? Feeling a bit freaked he thought 'Third time lucky' only to get this: ?And what thou doest, do quickly!? 
This style of reading the Bible isn't what God wants for us at all. Even word4U2day by itself isn't enough! We need a regular plan of what to read, including the less interesting bits. How embarrassing it would be to get to heaven and have Zephaniah ask us, ?How did you like my book?? ?All Scripture is God-breathed? (See 2 Ti 3:16).
A good Bible student is like a detective. The first thing she does is look for clues. She doesn?t say anything, interpret anything, or draw conclusions. All she does is examine the details; she studies all the evidence and looks at as many details as possible. Second, she begins asking questions about what she has observed. Third, she starts putting the evidence together and interpreting what she has. Fourth, she compares all the evidence, piecing it together to see how each fact fits and what it means. Finally, she draws a conclusion and on the basis of what she believes actually occurred and who was involved. This is the way to read your Bible, like a detective, with God helping you make sense of it!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Preserve my life according to Your Word.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:37 NIV</span><br>Here are some key things to remember to get the most out of your Bible:
(1)Learn to ask questions. The more questions you ask, the more you?ll get out of it. Bombard the text with ?Who? Why? What? Where? When?? As you do, you?ll discover things you?ve overlooked or never seen. It will seem as though you have been given a new pair of eyes! Fresh insights will leap out. Each time you pick up your Bible, pray, ?Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law? (Ps 119:18 NIV). (2) Write down what you have discovered. It's so much easier to think through stuff and understand more when you're writing down your thoughts and questions. It's not a case of copying out verses but keep a little diary of your thoughts, little nuggets of truth and things worth remembering. Your notebook and your Bible should always be together. If you really want to learn from the Bible, take notes or you'll probably forget exactly what you just read. 3) Make your goal to live it out, not just read a story. Bible boffin DL Moody said, ?The Bible was not given to increase our knowledge, but to change our lives.? James writes: ?Do not merely listen to the word?Do what it says? (Jas 1:22 NIV). 
As you read, ask yourself, ?What attitudes do I need to change? What do I need to start or stop doing? What do I need to believe or stop believing? What relationships do I need to work on? What does God want me to do?' Don?t read your Bible just to try and find something to impress other people with; find out what it has to say to you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Grace, mercy, and peace from?Jesus Christ.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 1:2</span><br>Paul prayed for three things to be given to those he loved. So when you?re not sure how to pray for others, what better example than this one where he asks God to give Timothy: 
(1) Grace: Peter says, ?God, who gives all grace, will make everything right. He will make you strong?support you and keep you from falling? (1 Pe 5:10 NCV). This word grace implies ?all of God you?ll ever need to handle whatever you?re facing.? That?s worth praying for, isn?t it? (2) Mercy: A large publishing house has a machine that automatically mails reminders to its readers that their subscriptions have expired. One day it malfunctioned and a rancher in a remote Colorado town received 9,734 notices! So he drove for kilometres to the nearest post office, mailed in his cheque, and wrote, ?Send me the magazine. I give up!? That?s how it is with God; He keeps sending us notices! The Bible says, ?Because of the Lord?s great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness? (Lam 3:22-23 NIV). (3) Peace: ?All who listen to Me shall live in peace and safety, unafraid? (Pr 1:33 TLB). What a gift to know that God?s peace can sustain you through the worst situations. And the kind of peace He gives is different from what the world offers (See Jn 14:27). At best, the world?s peace gives us temporary relief; but ?the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds? (Ph 4:7 NIV). 
So the next time you?re praying for someone ask God to saturate them in His grace, mercy, and peace.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When?he turned aside?God called to him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 3:4</span><br>A pastor writes: ?You can be in the midst of a common moment, only this time the activity is filled with the presence of God. When in the middle of your harried day you notice something unusual?your first reaction might be, ?I?m too tired to investigate?I?m not going to disrupt my life.? Yet in that moment you may have the opportunity for a unique encounter with God. When you see the unusual in the midst of the mundane, don?t continue business-as-usual. God may have ordained that moment to be life-changing for you and those around you.? 
It was business-as-usual for Moses the day he noticed the burning bush, an event that probably wasn?t uncommon in the hot desert. The really strange thing was this time the bush kept burning. And ?when?he turned aside to look, God called to him.? You might not have considered this possibility before but the greatest Spiritual experiences can happen right in the middle of your everyday life ? if you?re open to a divine interruption.
In Luke 10, Mary rejected her traditional cultural role as a woman who would've been expected to serve a visiting teacher, so that she could tune into Jesus' words of life. Meanwhile her sister Martha couldn't break out of the way she thought she was expected to act. Martha's 'kitchen agenda' made it almost impossible for her to be impacted by his words of life. Mary took a risk by being willing to break out of the ordinary. What did Jesus say when Martha complained about her sister's 'disrespect'? QUOTE: 'She has chosen what is better.'
We can see from both Moses and Mary that whatever the situation; if we're alone or if other people are around we can still have a holy moment. Are you so busy working on your ?to-do list? that it would take fire from heaven to get your attention? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be at rest?O my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 116:7 NIV</span><br>When you?re down in the dumps your energy is drained, your friendships turn sour, your enthusiasm runs dry, you're blinded to your blessings, you can't bear thinking about future plans and your desire to pursue God is gone. So is there a way out? 
1) Start with yourself! Somebody else might be making your life miserable but that doesn't get you off the hook in terms of your own attitude. Has the bad atmosphere of your negative emotions led to sin in your own life? ??your sins have cut you off from God? (Isa 59:2 NLT). Do you need to take a long look into the mirror of God's Word? Comparing yourself to other people can get you down but God's promises will lift you up! Jeremiah said, 'When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart's delight' (Jeremiah 15:16). 
2) Recharge your batteries. One American President refused to make important decisions at the end of the day, insisting that rest was necessary to essential to making good decisions. During all their crazy travels here and there (remember, this was before trains, plane and cars), Jesus often called His disciples aside to rest. He knew that when tiredness arrives, faith departs. He also taught them how to pray. Throughout the centuries, millions of Christians have found out that prayer is a great refresher for the soul and praying aloud prevents our thoughts from wandering down crooked and twisted paths. Daily prayer is a prescription that can help heal your emotions and lift you out of your doldrums. Try it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Abraham?obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.? </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:8 NIV</span><br>God guides us by closing one door then opening another. Abraham didn?t know where he was going, but he knew he couldn?t stay where he was ? and that?s enough to create movement in the right direction. Knowing you can?t stay where you are is often the starting point of God?s guidance. And it usually begins with an inward stirring and restlessness in your soul. Seasons have beginnings and endings. When a season is over, you sense it?s time to move! 
?They headed north [to]?Bithynia, but again the Spirit?said no. So instead they went on through Mysia province to the city of Troas. That night Paul had a vision. In his dream he saw a man over in Macedonia, Greece, pleading with him, ?Come over here and help us.? Well, that settled it. We would go to Macedonia, for we could only conclude that God was sending us to preach the Good News there? (Acts 16:7-10 TLB). Notice, when God kept Paul from going into Asia, Paul didn?t stay there praying and asking ?Why?? ? he just kept moving. 
For Paul, trying something and it not working out was no big deal. He believed that his gift to God was his willing heart and his mobility, and that God?s gift to him was that He would always guide him to where he needed to be. What God prevents, denies, or keeps us away from, is as much divine guidance as what He permits and opens up to us. Every door that didn?t open, every opportunity you didn?t get, every call that didn?t come, is as much God?s guidance as those that did. Think about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Abraham ... obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrew 11:8</span><br>The space shuttle's guidance system only kicks in when it's several miles up in the atmosphere. So what? Well, God's guidance can often be like that too; it becomes effective when you're in motion - e.g. you've got to get yourself off the launch pad! Are you stuck in the same spot praying &quot;Lord, I won't make a move until I hear from You,&quot; while He's saying, &quot;You'll hear from Me once you've done what I've already put before you to do?&quot; Sometimes we know what God wants, but we don't like it. So we pray hoping He'll change His mind and decide to do what we want instead!
   The Bible says, &quot;By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going&quot; (Heb 11:8 NIV). Have you ever tried to turn around a car or even a bike when it's not actually moving? It's impossible; the steering only works when the wheels are moving. Will you have unanswered questions and unspoken concerns? Absolutely. Just like your car's headlights don't shine round the next corner or over the next hill, God will give you direction on a 'need to know' basis. 
   That's why Paul writes: &quot;We walk by faith, not by sight&quot; (2 Co 5:7). Actually, it's the only way to go! It keeps you close to God, dependent on Him, and helps you remember Who the credit for all your successes belongs to. So whatever you do today, don't stay still; get into motion and be ready for God to take control. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'All the things I had toiled for ... I must leave ... to the one who comes after me.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ecclesiastes 2:18</span><br>Max Lucado tells this story that really puts like into perspective: &quot;A little boy is on the beach. He packs the sand with plastic shovels into a bright red bucket. Then he upends the bucket and a sandcastle is created. A man is in his office. He shoves papers into stacks and delegates assignments. Numbers are juggled, contracts are signed, and a profit is made. 
   &quot;Two builders - two castles. They see nothing and make something. And for both the tide will rise and the end will come. Yet that's where the similarities cease. For the boy sees the end while the man ignores it. Watch the boy as dusk approaches. As the waves near, the wise child begins to clap. There is no sorrow. No fear. No regret. He knew this would happen. He is not surprised. And when the great breaker finally crashes upon his castle and his masterpiece is sucked into the sea, he smiles, picks up his tools, takes his father's hand and goes home. The grown-up however, is not so wise. As the wave of years collapses on his castle he is terrified. He hovers over the sandy monument he protected. He blocks the waves from the walls he has made. Salt-water soaked and shivering he scowls at the incoming tide. 'It's my castle,' he defies. The ocean need not respond. Both know to whom the sand belongs...and I don't know much about sandcastles. But children do. Watch them and learn. 
   &quot;Go ahead and build, but build with a child's heart. When the sun sets and the tides take - applaud. Salute the process of life, then take your Father's hand and go home.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Zechariah 4:6</span><br>Being a Christian and spending time in a church community means you can't avoid certain religious words. When you don't understand them, these words can seem a bit weird and religious but they often have really awesome meanings. Take, for example, Anointing!
1. To be anointed is to be chosen. When God chooses people to do great things, He doesn't always select the obvious candidate. He may raise up a small, frail person who's half scared-to-death. Anointing is a way God makes it obvious to others that His hand is one someone's life for a very special reason.
2. Without God's anointing you're in trouble! Take the strange story of Samson (Judges 13-16). His anointing depending on him keeping a vow to God to do with his hairstyle! A shifty woman called Delilah tricked him and his enemies gave him a crop while he was asleep. He woke up and the power was gone. Samson learned the hard way that his strength only had one source; the Lord. Anyone blessed with a special anointing forgets this at their peril! 
3. The anointing brings God glory. Take the sling out of David's hand and the stone out of Goliath's forehead and what are they? Worthless by themselves! So if you're waiting for God to give you exceptional equipment before you decide to get into the fight, you're not going to experience great victories. They only come when you pray, 'Lord, I don't see how You could do this through me.' At that point it's clear that only God can get the glory. And remember it's his reputation, not yours, that it's all about!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:9</span><br>Are you living a dry life? Then get into God's Word and get it into you. It will affect you inside and out! On the inside God's Word is like medicine. You don't have to understand how it works, just keep taking it! Something amazing happens when you drink in the Scriptures. Temptation loses its power and overcoming strength replaces it. As those verses dissolve and digest into your soul, your ability to thrive and not just survive gets greater and greater - but that means reading your Bible evn when you don't feel like ut, have time to or you don't seem to be 'getting much out of it'. God says, 'As the rain and snow come down from Heaven and stay upon the ground to water the earth, and cause the grain to grow and to produce seed for the farmer and bread for the hungry, so also is my Word ... it always produces fruit. It shall accomplish all I want it to' (Isaiah 55:10-11). You don't have to have certain 'sensations' to know God's Word is working within you. David said, 'I have thought much about your words, and stored them in my heart so that they would hold me back from sin' (Psalm 119:11). Then he prayed, 'Open my eyes to see wonderful things in your Word' (Psalm 119:18). That's a prayer God will answer. When you read the Bible there will be an external effect too. Jesus said, 'You are already clean because of the word I have spoken unto you' (John 15:3). Do you want to look clean? Bathe in God's Word. Let it wash over you until you are glowing in its brilliance!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The Lord gave him success in everything he did.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 39:3</span><br>To succeed at anything, there are four things you must have:
1. Morals: These days many people are prepared to do anything to get what they want. That's not living God's way. The Christian's life is sometimes described as the 'narrow way'; Jesus in particular used that kind of language. We know from the way Jesus spoke to the religious leaders that He wasn't big on rules, but that doesn't mean He spoke an 'anything goes' message. Far from it. Jesus showed that God wants us to honour Him by using our freedom of choice to live right.
2. Methods: Your methods are the way you handle all the different situations that life throws at you. Are you like a mechanic with only a hammer in your toolbox? That's OK if all you do is knock nails but what if you come across a bolt? Especially when it comes to dealing with people. We need to learn that there are lots of different ways to handle a situation. What seemed helpful to that person yesterday may have the person you deal with today in floods of tears!
3. Means: We use a special word to describe the means of God helping us: provision. It can always be found following a God-given vision. That just leaves the question, 'Where is your vision from?'
4. Management: Jesus said, 'From the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.' (Luke 12:48) Some people don't ever really use the gifts that God gives them. That's totally tragic! Management is all about getting people working and guess who your biggest management challenge will be? Yourself!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'When he saw the man's condition, his heart went out to him.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 10:33</span><br>Are you too busy to care about anyone except yourself? Remember, life was very hectic for Jesus, yet He always responded to those in need. In Luke 10, Jesus tells a story about a Jewish traveller who was mugged by a gang and left to die on the road. Two priests passed by. They were religious leaders; surely they'd have compassion on this wounded man? No, they both had important appointments to keep and didn't stop. Then a Samaritan bloke came along. Of all people, he'd the most reason to look the other way because the Jews and Samaritans were big-time enemies. But the Bible says, 'When he saw the man's condition, his heart went out to him.' Having compassion will rearrange your priorities! The Good Samaritan decided that where he was going wasn't as important as where he was at that particular moment. What would you have done that day? Do you think you'd have acted like this Samaritan? How about when God tried to interrupt you on the 'flappiest' day when you just need to get from one place to another without any agro? Are you willing to ditch your personal agenda and do what He wants? If you're too busy to reach out to those who are hurting, you're just too busy! Today, ask God to help you not to be consumed with nonsense and don't miss another opportunity to help out. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE COME THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE .... TO THE FULL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 10:10 NIV</span><br>Deep inside us God has planted a desire to want to do something special with our lives. We don't just want to be average and go through life invisibly; we want to find that special 'something' that He put us here for. Jesus' disciples were no different, so what advice did He give them? 'Unless a grain of wheat is buried in the ground dead to the world, it is never anymore than a grain of wheat. But if it is buried, it sprouts and reproduces itself many times over.  In the same way, anyone who holds on to life just as it is destroys that life. But if you let it go, reckless in your love, you will have it forever, real and eternal' (John 12:24-25 TM).  That is not the world's way to get ahead, is it?
Paul also knew that 'death to the flesh' was so crucial to the Christian life that it became the cry of his heart: Listen, 'I gave up all that inferior stuff so I could know Christ personally, experience His resurrection power, be a partner in his suffering and go all the way with Him' (Philippians 3:10 TM). Paul takes his lead straight from JC; he wants to reach the place where the only thing that matters is what God wants! It's the exact opposite of all your natural instincts. 
'How will I know when I have died to self?' you ask. Because your desires, your pride and your independence won't matter any more. You can criticise a dead man and he's not affected by it. That's because he has moved to a higher dimension!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT GIVE THE DEVIL A FOOTHOLD. </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:27 NIV</span><br>Have you ever got into an argument just before church, then felt 'hypocritical' in the worship because of what you said 10 minutes before? All the while the devil is smiling and saying 'Gotcha'. That's because he knows God's Word can only be 'sown in peace' (James 3:18). If he can keep you from receiving the seed of God's Word, he can rob you of the harvest of blessing that comes from it. That's why you must be on your guard and protect your peace. 
Do you know that there's power in peace? Think about this: if the devil can get you upset then in a way he has won power over you; and you aren't going to let that happen are you? He only gains control when you 'lose it'.  Well make a decision today that you won't let him steal your peace, confuse you or make you run in circles any more. Listen, 'The wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure and full of quiet gentleness. Then it is peace-loving and courteous. It allows discussion and is willing to yield to others; it is full of mercy and good deeds. It is wholehearted and  straightforward and  sincere. And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of goodness' (James 3:17-18 TLB).
Next time you get all worked up, ask yourself 'If I give in to these negative emotions, what will the result be?' Remember, if you lose your joy you lose your strength, because 'the joy of the Lord is your strength' (Nehemiah 8:10).  So today - watch out and stay cool!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE KNOW HOW TROUBLES CAN DEVELOP PASSIONATE PATIENCE IN US</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 5:3  KJV</span><br>The toughest times are those when what we thought we knew about God seems to go flying out the window! That's when we learn about his silence. So what's the lesson God's likely to be teaching you whenever He's not saying a word? That He wants us to grow in our own ability to think, to process and arrive at a sound conclusion. And all the while He stands by with a hushed smile and a watchful eye. It's what your natural parents often did too without you noticing!
You've probably heard it said that faith comes by hearing. Well patience comes by silence!  Patience is God's gift to you when bad things remain unchanged. It's God's aspirin for when your aching head is tired of trying to work it out. There will be times when the pain lasts so long that only God can release the patience required, the divine grace to sustain you. 
Listen 'Keep your eyes on Jesus, who began and finished this race we are in. Study how He did it because He never lost sight of where he was headed  - that exhilarating finish in and with God - He could put up with anything along the way: cross, shame, whatever. And now He is there, in the place of honour, right alongside God. When you find yourselves flagging in your faith go over that story again, item by item, that long litany of hostility He ploughed through. That will shoot adrenaline into your souls' (Hebrews 12:1-3 TM). By looking at the examples the Bible gives us, we can see that patience is actually true strength harnessed by the Holy Spirit!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANYONE SERVES HE SHOULD DO IT WITH THE STRENGTH GOD PROVIDES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 4:11 NIV</span><br>Destiny. It's a mysterious kind of word isn't it? It somehow hides the answers to life's most difficult questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What should I be doing? Where should I be going? So how on earth do you even begin to get an impression of what yours might be?  
1) You need to get an idea of what somebody in tune with their destiny looks like. What are the common features? You'll probably notice that their motivation is high. They have amazing endurance to overcome obstacles. They are growing and learning. There's real joy in what they do.  
2) Look at your own 'raw material'. God has given you a certain temperament and a range of talents. What stirs your compassion? What ignites your passion? (Sometimes the problem that infuriates you most is the problem you were born to solve.) When do you feel most fulfilled? There's a big difference between doing something because you believe God's called you to it, and doing what your parents, your friends or your ego wants you to do. 
3) What are your obvious limitations? Knowing what you're called to do often starts with discovering what you're not called to do. When you can accept your limitations, you're getting much closer to the true path of your destiny.
So let's be clear: you have a God-given destiny. You need to seek it with an open mind. That's going to mean being ruthlessly open to the truth about yourself. Your destiny is something you discover, not something you choose. And remember, the Holy Spirit wants to guide you into it so be sure to follow where He leads.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM AND WHERE I AM GOING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 8:14 NIV</span><br>The news recently reported on a man who was released from prison after serving time for a crime he didn't commit. A case of mistaken identity had stolen many of his best years. And unless you understand who you are before God, satan will try to lock you up in a life sentence too. Identifying somebody means having the ability to recognise them and say exactly who they are. With that in mind, think about this: when you identify with who other people say you are versus who God says you are, you're heading for problems. Jesus identified only with God's opinion. 'I know where I came from and where I am going.' 
People said nasty things about Jesus, but the Bible says, 'The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being' (Hebrews 1:3 NIV). Knowing who you truly are now you've been born again gives you the confidence to hold your head high! Paul says, 'In [Christ] you have been made complete' (Colossians 2:10 NAS). 'Complete!' That means you have nothing missing! Once you accept that, you'll stop feeling like you're a second-class person and start living like royalty; because you are! You don't have to struggle to get in with the in-crowd when you know you're right in there with God. 
Do you need to remember again today that He loves you; that He has a plan for you? Never lose sight of that! Instead of taking your identity from the people around you, take it from Jesus, 'the author and finisher of our faith' (Hebrews 12:2), because only He knows where you come from and where you're going.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF YOU GAIN MORE RICHES, DON'T PUT YOUR TRUST IN THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALMS 62:10 NCV</span><br>People often talk about difficulties in life as being character building. The Book of Proverbs teaches, 'If you fall to pieces in a crisis, there wasn't much to you' (Proverbs 24:10 TM). But it's not just the hard times that reveal true character. If you're pursuing a dream and using all your God-given talent to make it a reality you'll eventually have to deal with success. Tough times challenge your faith and your patience, but handling success can be just as hard. Here's how it breaks down: hardship limits your options and forces you to focus on surviving; prosperity complicates your life and attacks your integrity with all sorts of selfish temptations. That's why David says, 'If you gain more riches, don't put your trust in them.'
Chuck Swindoll says, 'Being successful doesn't give anybody permission to call wrong right.' He's pointing out that success comes with certain dangers. God needs us to handle success without letting our values slide. The Bible says God promotes and downgrades as He sees fit, 'He decides who will rise and who will fall' (Psalms 75:7 NAS). And He doesn't need our permission to do it. And the Bible is full of examples proving that it happens. Joseph went from prison to become Prime Minister (Genesis 41:42-43). Daniel was promoted to rule over one-third of the country (Daniel 6:1-2). Amos went from picking figs to being a prophet in the royal household  (Amos 7:14-15). God gave a humble rancher named Job untold wealth. He took David 'from the sheepfolds...To shepherd...Israel... according to the integrity of his heart' (Psalms 78:70-72). So, success... can you handle it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE MAN WHO THINKS HE KNOWS SOMETHING DOES NOT YET KNOW AS HE OUGHT TO KNOW.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 COR 8:2 NIV</span><br>There are a lot of know-it-alls in this world, and Christians are just as likely to fall into this category as anyone else; maybe even more! When we read Paul's letter to the church in Corinth we get the impression that it had more that its fair share. So, what did the Apostle have to say about it? '...while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church. 'The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. But the man who loves God is known by God' (1 Corinthians 8:1-3 NIV).  That's wisdom! One of the important lessons we can draw out of this is that growing up spiritually is not about knowing more stuff but showing more love. That doesn't mean we switch off our brains and let our emotions run riot - it means developing the right relationship between our head and our heart. Solomon understood this to the extent that he wrote: 'As he thinks in his heart, so is he' (Proverbs 23:7 NKJ). How can you think something in your heart? Marcus Borg writes, '...heart suggests something deeper than the intellect and the world of ideas... this deeper level of the self is the place of transformation.' Hopefully you've already realised that when the Bible talks about the heart it doesn't mean the biological heart, it means the centre of who you are. People who don't learn to think from the heart find themselves at the mercy of their circumstances; they react and every decision comes off the 'top of their head'. Don't let that be you. Ask God to touch your head and heart today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL SAVE MY PEOPLE WHO CANNOT WALK AND GATHER MY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ZEPHANIAH 3:19 NCV</span><br>David and Jonathan had a made a special promise to each other that included their families. So when Jonathan died in battle and David became king, he looked for someone to bless for Jonathan's sake; just like God is looking to bless you for Christ's sake (see Ephesians 1:3). David found out that Jonathan had a son, Mephibosheth (see 2 Samuel 9), who had a disability and couldn't walk without using crutches. He lived out in the countryside a long way from the centre of power in Jerusalem. By rights he should've been a prince living in luxury in the royal palace but history had taken a different course, now he only knew poverty and isolation. His main problem wasn't his disability or his remote location though; it was fear. Mephibosheth knew that his grandfather King Saul had tried to kill David many times. He'd convinced himself that now David was in power he'd want to get his own back. What a twisted situation; David really wants to bless him but Mephibosheth thinks he wants to beat him up! You've not allowed your image of God to get distorted like that, have you?  There are millions of people walking around today scared of God, trying to hide from Him because they think He wants to beat them up. And yet nothing could be further from the truth. God's deepest desire is to have a relationship with all the broken people who are distant from Him. That's why Jesus came 'to seek and to save' (see Luke 19:10). Come on, you've been hiding long enough! It's time to take your place at the King's table.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HIS POWERFUL WORD IS SHARP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 4:12 TM</span><br>In 'Life Essentials', Tony Evans writes, 'I've had my car for several years now, but I went for about two years without ever reading the owner's manual. That changed one day when my car broke down and I had to take it in for service. The manager began showing me all the stuff my car was equipped to do. I didn't even know half that stuff was available because I had never opened the book. He told me, for instance, that the car had a built-in speaker for telephone conversations, and showed me how to use the car phone without having an accident while trying to dial all the numbers. I listened in amazement, and quickly decided that it would be in my best interests to read the owner's manual that came with my car. But I am not reading that manual just to check off how many chapters I read, or memorize various passages. I am reading it so I can enjoy all the good gifts the manufacturer gave me when I purchased the car.' And your Bible is a bit like a manual - and much, much more...
Your Bible will speak to the deepest part of you, way down where you can't receive knowledge from any other source. It's like keyhole surgery reaching right inside us: 'His powerful Word is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel, cutting through everything, whether doubt or defence, laying us open to listen and obey.' Other people may hear what we say and see what we do, but when we get alone with God and open His Word our thoughts and intentions are exposed. We all need the reality-check the Bible provides!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 8:10 NIV</span><br>God given joy not only makes you feel good, it also makes you strong! 'The joy of the Lord is your strength' (Nehemiah 8:10 NIV). So, it's important to build yourself up with things that are going to help joy grow in your heart.  How do you cultivate a life that's full of joy? Here are some tips: a) sing. Singing songs can make us feel happy or sad depending on what the song is about, but if you sing a song about God and how great he is, that will not only bless God but make you feel good too! (Psalms 33:1)  b) chat. Spend time talking to God. Make time to get to know Him. Why? Listen 'you will fill me with joy in your presence' (Psalms 16:11 NIV). When you're in His presence (ie having a special God-moment) He crams your heart with love, joy, peace and loads of other good stuff too!  c) chill. Be someone who is a peace maker. Don't be someone who picks fights and always has to have the last word. God promises, 'Joy for those who promote peace' (Proverbs 12:20 NIV)  4) smile. 'A cheerful look brings joy to the heart' (Proverbs 15:30 NIV). A smile is a powerful thing. If someone looks at you funny, it can make you feel really pants, so don't walk around looking like you're chewing a wasp! As you give joy to other people you'll be amazed at how much happiness you experience in your own life. 
 A famous poet once said, 'To have joy one must share it'. So go on, spread some Joy around today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE WRITTEN YOU'RE NAME ON THE PALMS OF MY HAND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 49:16</span><br>Have you ever sat and thought about a Blue Whale? Probably not. Well, let's do it right now. The Blue Whale is the biggest living creature in the whole world. Its heart is the size of a car, its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, 50 adult humans could stand inside its mouth and you could take a swim down its arteries. Don't you think that's amazing? Now check out the smallest frogs in the world: they live in Cuba, they never get bigger than a centimetre and they can happily sit on a penny! The point is; If God could think up, create and sustain such incredible creatures, taking care to give them beautiful colours, character and makes sure they are in the right environment to survive; how much more do you think He will do for you? 'Look at the wildflowers...have you ever seen colours and designs quite like them? If God gives such attention to the wildflowers, don't you think he'll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you?' (Luke 12:26-28 TM).
You don't need to worry or fear, coz God's got your back! Listen: 'I have written your name on the palms of my hands' (Isaiah 49:16). Do you ever write something on your hand so you don't forget? This verse is saying that God has that sort of intimate awareness of your life. What an incredible thought; the maker of the universe, who flung the stars into space, thinks about you! He watches over you, making sure you're safe. Like a parent watches over their child, your Heavenly Father looks after you. Think on that today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW IT ALL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:7 TM </span><br>One day a scientist asked an old preacher how come the Bible version of creation defied logic. Smiling, he replied, 'The reason God came from nowhere is because there wasn't anywhere for Him to come from. And coming from nowhere He stood on nothing, for there was nowhere for Him to stand. And standing on nothing He reached out where there was nowhere to reach, and caught something when there was nothing to catch. Then He hung that something on nothing and told it to stay there, and nobody said a word, because there wasn't anybody around to say anything. Then God said to Himself, 'that's good!''
Did you get that? Its part of our God-given nature to try and figure things out, the only problem is we're not as clever as we think we are! King Solomon said 'Don't assume that you know it all,' or you'll find out the hard way that you don't! One Christian writes: 'I...couldn't feel at peace. Unless I'd everything figured out...I became anxious, restless, nervous, worried and grouchy...similar to...a drug addict who needs a &quot;fix&quot;; the severity wasn't the same but the symptoms were. I was a Christian and supposedly walked by faith...I trusted Jesus for salvation, but in other areas I trusted myself.' Sound familiar? When you worry it just shows you've got the 'I trust my way, not God's way' sickness. Jeremiah said, 'Mere mortals can't run their own lives...men and women don't have what it takes' (Jeremiah 10:23 TM). So stop trying to control every thing! Life is much more peaceful when you decide to stand on God's Word and trust Him, regardless of how you feel!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 2:17 NKJ</span><br>Andrés Segovia was born in Southern Spain and began playing guitar as a small child. In those days the guitar was little more than a folk instrument. Serious composers and musicians didn't respect it. But Segovia saw potential in the guitar for classical music. He began studying the techniques of classical musicians who played the violin and cello. Then he applied those techniques to his playing and developed other methods on his own. He adapted the compositions of masters such as Bach, and learned to play them on his instrument. In 1909, Segovia made his debut - at the age of 16. In 1919, he toured the world and won over the classical establishment. Soon, for the first time, composers were writing classical music for the guitar and a whole new kind of music was born. Over the course of nearly 80 years, Segovia completely changed people's perception of his instrument. But like many big dreams that become realised, his dream made an impact far beyond what he imagined. It could be argued that his efforts opened the door for the guitar, not only to the concert hall but also to the jazz band. That in turn led to the electrically amplified guitar. So whether you're into 'The Kooks' or 'Delirious?' you can thank Andrés Segovia! If it wasn't for his dream, the music of the 20th century may have gone in an entirely different direction. 
Have you heard the cheesy saying, 'big oaks grow from little acorns'? well it's true isn't it?! When you discover your God-given dream and commit to it, there's no telling how far you'll go or what kind of impact you'll make.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOOK, THIS DREAMER IS COMING!...LET US...KILL HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 37:19-20 NKJ</span><br>Everybody has a dream. What's yours? If you could do anything, what would it be? Most of us don't achieve great things because we give up, we fall short, we get off track, we settle, or we dream too small. Only two things stand in your way: dreaming it, then doing it. Have you dared to dream; to really dream? If something is within your reach already, it isn't a dream. If it doesn't stretch you, cost you, or involve risk, it isn't a dream. Dreams change you even as they change the world around you. 
Maybe you're listening to critical people. Remember the story of Joseph? He dreamed big dreams; God-given dreams. And what was the response of his brothers? They said, 'Look, this dreamer is coming! Let us...kill him.' People who aren't pursuing their own dreams are usually the first to criticise people who are. So, who are you listening to?
Maybe you're afraid to dream too big. You don't want to fail. Nobody does. But 'safe living' leads to regret. An American President called 'Teddy' Roosevelt said, 'Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor souls who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the grey twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.' What's the worst thing that could happen if you pursue your dream and don't achieve it? You could end up where you are now. And what's the best thing that could happen? You could find your dreams come true!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU OR FORGET YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 1:5 NCV</span><br>Sadly, some of us think so little of ourselves that we make do with mates that treat us badly rather than be left alone. Being around others doesn't guarantee you won't be lonely; you can be around people 24/7, and still feel empty and used. 
God doesn't like loneliness, He knows that people aren't at their best if they feel isolated and alone. Listen: 'The Lord God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be alone&quot;' (Genesis 2:18 NCV). God has made us to relate to others and to form and build good relationships that will encourage and inspire us. Sometimes, because we've been let down before we are afraid of being hurt again so we keep our defences up. We think if we don't get involved with people we can't get hurt, and as a result we isolate ourselves and end up lonely. 
If you're feeling lonely right now, God wants you to know this, 'I will not leave or forget you.' (Joshua 1:5) Read that again. Let those words sink in deep. He really means it! He'll never leave you all alone and He is so faithful. He knows that people let each other down - look at all the times in the Bible when the people He created let Him down! We all say things we don't really mean and it's so easy for a small disagreement to escalate into a huge fall out in a moment. But don't let your past mistakes dictate your future choices. You're a great person to know and there are loads of people who will be really blessed by having you as a friend.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT YOU DID NOT RECEIVE?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 4:7 NAS</span><br>There is a story about a rather eccentric family. The son had become very successful and lived on the other side of the world from his parents. He was really loaded and one of the things he especially enjoyed doing was buying his elderly mum and dad really unusual presents for Christmas. One Christmas he found a unique gift: a talking bird that spoke five languages and sang the National Anthem standing on one foot. It cost £10,000. But the man didn't mind. So he paid for the bird and had it specially delivered to his parents' home just in time for Christmas. Later, on Christmas Day, he made a long-distance phone call to wish his parents ,Happy Christmas, and to ask them how they liked their present. 'Dad, did you get my gift?' he said. 'Yep, I sure did,' replied his father. 'So did you like it?' he asked, to which his dad replied, 'Yes son, it was delicious, much better than the turkey we would usually have!' His dad obviously missed the point. He treated as ordinary, a gift that was very special. Doh!
Too often that's how we treat the blessings God gives us. Paul asks, 'What do you have that you did not receive?' Everything we have, including the breath in our lungs, is a gift from God! And James adds: 'Every good thing given...is from above, coming down from the Father' (James 1:17 NAS).  So anything we give back to God is just returning to Him a small part of what He's given to us already. Try to remember to be thankful to God for his unique care for you today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN HE HAS TESTED ME, I WILL COME OUT AS PURE GOLD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOB 23:10 NRS</span><br>Mega-church Pastor Rick Warren says: 'God has a purpose behind every problem. He uses circumstances to develop our character. In fact, He often depends more on circumstances to make us like Jesus than He does on our reading the Bible. And the reason is obvious: we face circumstances 24-hours-a-day.' 
We learn things about God when having a tough time that we can't learn any other way. Tough times draw us closer to Him! 'The Lord is close to the broken-hearted' (Psalms 34:18). Problems force us to go to God and ask for His help. Paul writes, 'we...saw how powerless we were to help ourselves; but that was good, for then we put everything into the hands of God' (2 Corinthians 1:9 TLB). Giving the controls over to God and trusting Him with how it's gonna turn out is hard for most of us to do. Why? Coz we're not used to trusting others and it turning out well; so many of us have been let down by people we thought we could trust!
Do you feel as if life is a test at the moment? This might sound a bit weird but have you ever stopped to think that God might somehow be in the testing? Listen: 'the testing of your faith proves that it is genuine.' Since God's plan is to make us more like Jesus, He'll take through some of the tough challenges Jesus went through. Like what?  Temptation; rejection; putting others peoples needs first; criticism; and betrayal. None of these are fun, but if you let God help you through the tough times you will end up shining like gold! (Job 23:10)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I DECIDE TO DO GOOD, BUT I DON'T DO IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROM 7:19 TM</span><br>Do you feel like you keep having the same fight over and over? Paul talks about this in Romans, 'I decide to do good, but I don't really do it; I decide not to do bad, but then I do it anyway' (Romans 7:19 TM). Why does this happen? Well, when you try to make choices based on feelings you're going too end up in a pickle. Sure, God gave you feelings and the ability to make choices, but He always intended that those decisions to be submitted to the leading of His Holy Spirit. Listen, 'But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you '(John 14:26 NIV). A counsellor gives sound advice and who better to advise the choices you make than Him? The Holy Sprit cannot lie; He is the Spirit of God. 
Sometimes we have to fight battles in life that are impossible to win in our own strength. We look at what we're up against and it's quite obvious that it's not a fair match. Hello! Surely you've not forgotten the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), When David looked at the giant he didn't focus on his armour and massive spear; he knew that God was bigger than any giant and was on his side! Goliath was killed with one hit from a pebble. When you get your focus right your trust and confidence in God will grow, then all you'll need is a 'pebble' of faith in action and your giant will come crashing down.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GO AND MAKE DISCIPLES</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 28:19 NIV </span><br>'All authority on earth has been given to me, therefore go and make disciples.' These are some of the most famous and most quoted words that Jesus ever spoke, but so often we can be intimidated by them because we don't really know where we're supposed to 'Go'. We spend our lives looking to the future, telling ourselves that when we're older we'll go to Africa, build an orphanage and become a helper of the hurting and broken. Or we look at the people who seem to be doing amazing things for God and we compare ourselves and end up feeling rubbish, we feel defeated before we've set foot out the door.
But what if when Jesus said 'Go' he didn't mean you have to leave the country! And do you really need to wait until you've got a certificate in orphanage building before you can do anything for God? What if Jesus was just setting a challenge to look at the immediate world around you, and see where you could 'Go' and get involved in peoples lives and see them touched by God?  
Are you saying to yourself, 'Go where'? Well you can start with your school, your college, your family, your mates. If you pause right now how many people can you think of who need to know that God loves them? He's given you a good heart full of His love, a mouth to tell them about Him and legs so you can walk up to them and start a chat. Those people are your 'go' ground. Live for today, not tomorrow. Take every opportunity to 'Go'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED THE MAN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 8:3 NIV</span><br>'Unclean!' Imagine if you had to shout that every time you went any where near people because you had to warn them that a diseased and dirty person was coming. Well that's what people with leprosy had to do 2000 years ago. Leprosy is a really contagious disease that people in some poor parts of the world still suffer from. In the time of Jesus it was totally incurable, a slow painful death sentence. If you had leprosy you were an outcast, feared, unloved and untouched. So when Jesus healed a man with leprosy, 'He said, &quot;Be clean!&quot; And immediately the leprosy left him'(Luke 5:13 NIV),  that in itself was incredible but the bit of the story that makes you catch a glimpse of how  amazing Jesus actually was, is summed up in these few words,
 'Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man' (Luke 5:13 NIV). In putting His hand on the man Jesus related to him as a valuable human being made in God's image. In that one action He broke down every religious and social barrier and connected with his emotional pain. His touch was saying, 'I'm not afraid to be associated with you.' There would have been gasps from the crowd of seriously shocked onlookers. 
The challenge today is to be Jesus' hands in your school, college, uni or wherever you work. Will you dare to associate yourself with the outcast and be someone who brings healing to those in pain? The man with leprosy wanted to know if Jesus was willing, Jesus asks you the same question today! Are you willing?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU ARE LIKE A SMART CARPENTER WHO BUILDS HIS HOUSE ON SOLID ROCK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 7:24 TM</span><br>The Message (TM) is a fresh and modern approach to the text of the Bible that sheds new light on its truth.  Listen:   'If you just use my words in Bible studies and don't work them into your life, you are like a stupid carpenter who built his house on the sandy beach. When a storm rolled in and the waves came up, it collapsed like a house of cards' (Matthew 7:26-27 TM). Jesus doesn't want you to be a hypocrite, pretending to be a certain way to look really spiritual but in your heart being totally different. Going along to church and doing Bible study isn't what makes your foundations strong. Spending time with God and developing your relationship with Him does.
In the Bible one of God's names is 'The Rock' (sound like a wrestler!), and it also says 'you are God's building' (1 Corinthians 3:9). So, if the building is on 'The Rock', when storms come they've got no chance. Imagine that your life is a house; you've got walls, doors, a kitchen, a lounge, a bedroom, a bathroom.  If a load of people occupy your life that don't treat you very well and are really messy the house is going to suffer. If, on the other hand, you let Jesus come and make His home in you, (John 14:23), then the house will be strong on the inside and on the outside. 'If you work these words into your life, you are like a smart carpenter who built his house on solid rock. Rain poured down, the river flooded, a tornado hit; but nothing moved that house. It was fixed to the rock' (Matthew 7:24 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NOTHING CAN GET BETWEEN US AND GOD'S LOVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:39 TM</span><br>Opinions are powerful! They can either build us up or knock us down, and if we're not careful they create a ceiling that we keep hitting, that stops us from moving onwards and upwards. Get God's opinion of you and stick with it! If others don't agree, so what? You wouldn't be so hard on yourself or so aware of the opinions of others if you really knew how God felt about you! He made up His mind about you when you were still totally oblivious to Him, so stop running from person to person looking for love. Open your Bible; it's a living letter, a statement of intent from a Father who wants the best for His children. Still doubting? Listen: 'Do you think anyone is going to be able to drive a wedge between us and Christ's love for us? There's no way! Not trouble, not a hard time, not hatred, not hunger, not homelessness, not bullying threats, not backstabbing...not even the worst sins listed in Scripture...none of this fazes us because Jesus loves us. I'm absolutely convinced that... nothing can get between us and God's love' (Romans 8:35-39 TM).
'But I mess up so much!' you say. We all do! But nothing you've done has changed God's mind about you, and nothing ever will! His love sticks with us; it's always there, always available and 100% guaranteed: 'His love never quits' (1 Chronicles 16:34 TM). God's love for you is set in concrete and it has no ending! And that's the foundation you can build your life on!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANYTHING IS EXCELLENT OR PRAISEWORTHY-THINK ABOUT SUCH THINGS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:8 NIV</span><br>Imagine that you were really serious about running in the London marathon. How likely is it that you'd go on a junk food diet before the big race? The fuel you put into something determines its performance. If you fill your diesel car with petrol you'll break down! Just like our bodies, if you feed your mind with junk it won't function in a healthy way. 
Think excellent thoughts (Philippians 4:8);  if you do this it will transform you! What enters your mind repeatedly occupies it, shapes it, controls it, and in the end expresses itself in what you do and who you become. That's the law of exposure. And it's as sure as the law of gravity. Your mind will absorb and reflect whatever it's exposed to. The events you go to, the stuff you read or don't read, the music you listen to, the pictures you look at, the stuff you watch on TV and cinema, what you talk about, what you let your mind dwell on, are all shaping how you think, and eventually your character and your destiny.
So what is the answer?  Do a check up from the neck up! Start to pray: 'Thank you Lord that you have given me the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16), and I have the Holy Spirit who helps me to be self-controlled (Galatians 5:23).  I thank You that as I do what Your Word says, and fix my mind on what is excellent, admirable, honourable, praiseworthy (Philippians 4:8), my mind will be cleaned up, made new and I will be transformed (Romans 12:2). Amen!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 2:4 NRS </span><br>Living in the approval of God frees you! It frees you from being addicted to approval; worrying what other people think of you. When you're an addict, no matter how much of your drug of choice you get it's never enough. And like all junkies, you go crazy when your drug is withheld. 'Approval Addicts' are always at the mercy of other people's opinions. As a result they feel like they are on an emotional roller coaster of highs and lows.
The Apostle Paul was free to speak the truth in love: to confront people, or be gentle with them. If someone didn't like Paul or agree with what he said, he didn't let it get to him. That's because his life wasn't built upon their approval. 'We have been approved by God.' Paul didn't go around needing to: a) compare himself with others b) show off to prove himself  c) impress or compete with others  d) be the big boss. 
Living in God's approval set him free from anxiety, and meant he could enjoy the life God called him to live.
When you're young and insecure you tend to worry about what others think of you. But as you get older, you start to realise that most of the time people weren't thinking nasty things about you at all. They were too busy worrying about what you thought of them! Living in God's approval frees us from all that stress. It gives us the strength to deal with criticism and conflict, because we know our identity. And our identity is this: we are God's accepted children. And since we are accepted and approved by Him, what else matters?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT UP WITH EACH OTHER, AND FORGIVE ANYONE WHO DOES YOU WRONG.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:13 </span><br>This silly story appeared in a newspaper's letter column: 'A lady took my seat in church. My seat is on the right as you enter the sanctuary. I can rest my arm on the end. It's a good seat, but I wouldn't raise a fuss about a seat. Actually, it was three months ago she took it and I really don't know why. I've never done anything to her, never taken her seat. I suppose I'll have to come an hour early now to get my seat. She took it because it's one of the best seats in the house. She'd no business taking it and I'm not going to church two hours early to get what's rightfully mine! This is the way great social injustices begin: abusive people taking other people's seats! It's the way seeds of revolution are sown. A person can only stand so much. Where's it all going to end? If somebody doesn't stand up and be counted, nobody's seat will be safe. People will sit where they please, and next they'll take my parking place. World order will be in shambles!'
You smile, but it's amazing how quickly you can get bent out of shape when what you think is' rightfully yours' is taken away. Paul writes, 'Put up with each other, and forgive anyone who does you wrong...as Christ has forgiven you. Love is more important than anything...It...ties everything... together.' Plus if you let bitterness into your heart you'll just end up hurting yourself. If someone upsets you be quick to forgive them, so you don't get stuck in a rut and you can move on and enjoy living.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PERFECT LOVE DRIVES OUT FEAR.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 4:18 NCV</span><br>We all have things that make our palms sweat and our hearts race; God never said we wouldn't experience the emotion of fear. But He keeps saying: 'Fear not.' Why? Because he wants you to know that you do not meet your fear alone. A big theme in the Bible is that what ever comes against God's kid's comes against Him too; and you don't have to read very much to realise you don't want to mess with Almighty God.
King David wasn't always a King, he started out as a young shepherd boy. One time a lion attacked his flock and in God's strength he defeated it, then a bear, and later he killed Goliath. The lion was just an opportunity in disguise. If David had chickened out or legged it, he'd have missed his chance to become king of Israel. So when a 'lion' comes into your life, recognise it for what it is: a chance to confront your fear stand up to it and kick it in the teeth.  No Mercy! 
Frank Darabont's film 'The Shawshank Redemption had a famous tag line, 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.' If we focus our attention on our fears they will get the better of us. But if we focus on God's perfect love for us and trust Him to guard us, (Psalms 91:11) fear has to flee. Listen: 'Perfect love drives out fear' (1 John 4:18). So the greatest weapon you have against the things you fear in your life is Love. Be confident in God's love for you and watch your fears melt.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY STOOD AND CONFESSED THEIR SINS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 9:2 NCV</span><br>Max Lucado writes: 'Upon hearing that Jerusalem lay in ruins, Nehemiah prayed 'I confess the sins we Israelites have done against you' (Nehemiah 1:6 NCV). The most powerful man in the country is saying that before they can rebuild, they must repent. What a scene; loads of people spending time praying; not making excuses or requests, but asking God for forgiveness for how they've done things so far. Just imagine, the leaders of government, business, law, entertainment and education doing that? Could it happen? But it starts with you. 'If My people...will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will...heal their land' (2 Chronicles 7:14 NKJV). The nation changes when God's people change. We can be so opinionated about when other people are get it wrong, but we tend to go quiet when it comes to what's wrong with us. We feel like the man in the prayer meeting, who prayed 'God; I thank you that this country has people like me. The man on the corner needs welfare, I don't. The prostitute on the street has AIDS, I don't. The drunk at the bar needs alcohol, I don't'. Next to him is a broken man who humbly whispers 'Lord, like my brother on welfare, I'm dependent on your grace. Like my sister with AIDS, I'm infected with mistakes. Like my friend who needs a drink, I need something to ease my pain. Have mercy on me, a sinner'. After telling a story like that Jesus said, 'I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God' (Luke 18:14 NIV).'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR LIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2  PETER 1:3 NIV</span><br>The Tartar tribes of central Asia used a particular curse against their enemies. They didn't call for their swords to rust or their people to die of disease. No, they said, 'May you stay in one place forever.' Wow that is harsh! But the devil tries to curse us in the same way. He hates to see God's kids happy and living their lives for Jesus to the maximum! For some people their biggest fear is death or getting really sick; but living a life that goes no where and has no point is like living in a prison, just counting the days. How depressing is that? Here's the good news. YOU'RE NOT CURSED! You're blessed with heaven's best! Listen: 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness' (2 Peter 1:3). Did you know that God has placed His power in you and because of that no curse has a leg to stand on in your life?  When Jesus was crucified He not only made a way for us to know God, but He also defeated the devil and all his schemes, totally humiliating him! And because you have Christ in you, (Colossians1:27) that means you carry His victory into every day! So each time the devil tell you 'your life ain't going no where' you remind him that he is a loser. This is what God says about you: 'I know what I'm doing. I have it all planned out; plans to take care of you, not abandon you, plans to give you the future you hope for' (Jeremiah 29:11 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SEEK FIRST HIS KINGDOM AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>(MATT 6:33 NIV)</span><br>Do you ever think you'd rather be anywhere than in a prayer meeting? Do you find it hard to know when God is speaking to you? Well you're not on your own. What Christians often fail to realize is that prayer isn't a boring job we have to endure to please God; no Way! Prayer is talking to the Maker of heaven and earth. Jesus promises us some amazing things will happen when we pray to God with sincere hearts and with Faith. Listen, 'when two or three come together in my name, there am I with them' (Matthew 18:20), so when we pray together God shows up...that's His promise. Jesus also said, 'You may ask for anything in my name, and I will do it.' (John 14:14)
That doesn't mean that if you say, 'I ask for a Ferrari in Jesus' name' Jesus has to give you one. When we pray and ask God for things, He is looking at our hearts, not jotting down all the fancy words we use. He wants to know that our motives for asking are right and in line with His plan for our life. Sometimes we ask for things we think will be good for us but He knows would actually rip us up. So how do you know you're on the right track? Well Jesus gives us a tip, 'seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well' (Matthew 6:33). If you put Him and your relationship with Him first, and press in and pray, you will be amazed at the adventure He takes you on!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHAT WE WILL BE HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE KNOWN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:2 NIV</span><br>You say, 'My life is so messed up at the moment.' Maybe that's true, but the Bible says: 'Dear friends, now we are the children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known.' Have you ever been to a building site? It looks like anything but a building, doesn't it? But bit-by-bit under the architect's supervision, bricks, beams, and piles of sand start taking shape. And the church is a bit like a construction site too. When the Church is doing the kind of things Jesus called it to then the seats should be packed with people who feel messed up and are looking for the answer, people being pulled out of rough situations, people in the process of being restored. 
News Flash! Growing up doesn't just happen; no baby comes out of the womb clean and in the latest 'Baby Gap' outfit! Nope, as we all know there is pain, stretching, messiness, and then major life adjustments always accompanying a new life. When you said 'Yes' to Jesus He gave you new life and not just any life; He promises life in all it's fullness, (John 10:10) . 
There is a plan and purpose behind what's going on in your life right now. Things are coming together. You see, when Jesus comes into your life your spirit is immediately changed, but your emotions, desires and attitudes still need work. When you choose to let God's Spirit guide you and not how you feel, you will start to see a change, coz His Spirit will touch your emotions, your desires...every part of you will start to become more like Him. (1John 3:10) How awesome is that!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS JOB IS TOO HEAVY...TO...HANDLE...BY YOURSELF.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 18:18 TLB</span><br>During their journeys through the desert the Israelites looked to Moses for everything, and he was wearing himself out trying to meet their expectations. When his father-in-law saw how much time this was taking he said, 'Why are you trying to do all this alone...You're going to wear yourself out...this job is too heavy...to handle...by yourself...Find some capable, godly, honest men...and appoint them...That way...you will share the burden...be able to endure the pressures, and there will be peace and harmony'...Moses listened...and followed this suggestion' (Exodus 18:14-24 TLB).
Some people seem to have a 'superhero' complex which makes them think that they have to do everything on their own. One of the best lessons you can learn is how to delegate. Delegation is a word used a lot in the business world. It means instead of shouldering all the responsibility for a big job or complicated project a manager will choose hard workers or people who are responsible and trustworthy and give them some of the responsibilities. Delegating; or basically asking for help; is a sign of strength, not weakness. 
Sometimes our pride gets in the way from asking coz we think people will think less of us but that's the fast lane to meltdown! Asking the right people (that is the key by the way) for help strengthened Moses for the job of leading Israel the way God intended.  
Unless you learn to delegate, you'll disintegrate. As you start to lead groups and projects it's easy to get to big for your boots. Paul says: 'Do not think you are better than you really are.' (Romans 12:3 NCV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ENCOURAGE YOUR PEOPLE...CORRECTING THEM WHEN NECESSARY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>TITUS 2:15 TLB</span><br>It's hard to lead others further than you've gone yourself, especially when you're more concerned about your popularity than keeping the team on course. One of the first lessons in leadership is this: it's impossible to please everybody! If you constantly need approval you'll end up being controlled by those you're supposed to lead. Paul recognised this, that's why he told Timothy: 'Teach...and encourage your people...correcting them when necessary. You have the authority to do this, so don't let anyone...disregard what you say' (Titus 2:15 TLB).
Insecure, inexperienced leaders stress over decisions they think might cause unhappiness in the ranks. They feel responsible for other people's emotional reaction. Here's a really obvious rule: when you're doing what you know you should be doing and others don't agree, that's their problem, unless you allow it to become yours. Sometimes these kind of disagreements about vision just happen and people choose to go their own way. That's one of the hardest things about leadership. But a mature leader deals with this kind of disappointment and keeps a good attitude. Think about a parent warning a child about putting her hand on a hot stove - it's not the parent's responsibility to make them enjoy hearing it, right? Hopefully, as they mature they'll understand. If only that were true in leadership! Some people don't like hearing 'no' regardless of how old they get. We all need to be told 'no' from time to time, leaders included, otherwise we'll never be happy with anything other than getting our own way. 
So why do you want to lead? Is it to get your own way or is it to show The Way to a lost world?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I'M WITH YOU ALL THE WAY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 7:4 TM</span><br>For leadership at its finest, check out the Apostle Paul. He told the young, often-troubled Christians at Corinth: 'I'm with you all the way, no matter what. I have...the greatest confidence in you. If only you knew how proud I am of you...despite all our troubles.' In spite of their immaturity, and 'fights in the church' (2 Corinthians 7:5 TM), Paul was their biggest cheerleader. He knew how to comfort and correct, how to encourage and discipline - signs of excellent leadership. So, how do you become excellent leader: a) show consistency; everyone knows that whatever their own position or role they will be valued equally and treated fairly b) constantly express appreciation, realising people need reminding again and again that they're an important part of the team c) recognise the wisdom of listening to anyone's suggestions, opinions and ideas without being dismissive because when lots of different points of view on an issue have been gathered any future decisions will be much more likely to succeed  d) don't see people as statistics; businesswoman Mary Kay Ash who made her fortune by setting up the 'Mark Kay' cosmetics line said, 'P &amp; L doesn't just mean &quot;profit and loss&quot;  it means &quot;people and love&quot;' e) explain why they things need doing a certain way, because it lessens the agro that can stew in a team who feel 'ordered around.' 
Remember, Jesus was the ultimate leader and his approach was this: &quot;You've observed how godless rulers throw their weight around, how quickly a little power goes to their heads. It's not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant.&quot; (Matthew 20:25-26 TM)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE GAVE CONSTANT ENCOURAGEMENT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 20:2 TM</span><br>A leader has two important characteristics: he or she knows where they're going, and can show others the value of going with them. There are lots of talented people who will never be excellent leaders because they're more interested in themselves than in those they lead. They'll have to go through the school of hard knocks until they become sensitive to other people's needs. But effective leaders don't wait for that to happen. They realise that any numpty can come up with an idea, but the people who implement them are priceless. American Football coach 'Bear' Bryant used to say, 'I've learned how to hold a team together... There are just three things I say: if something goes bad, I did it; if it goes semi-good, we did it; if it goes really good, you did it!'
If you have a feeling in your bones that God might want you to be some kind of leader, chew on this: excellent leaders are approachable; they don't get touchy and fly off the handle; they never let minor problems poison their outlook; they sandwich every slice of criticism between two layers of praise. True leaders are not people who knock the wind out of others; no, they are the ones who breathe it back in! Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson once said this, 'Keep your fears to yourself but share your courage with others.' Good eh! Encouraging others simply means giving them a courage injection; like this: 'Paul called the disciples together and...gave constant encouragement, lifting their spirits...charging them with fresh hope.' That's excellent leadership! So today ask God to give you what it takes to lead.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LORD...MY LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 31:14-15 NCV</span><br>We kick off today with a story of something that happened a few years ago across the pond in the US of A. Terry Schafer wanted to buy her husband a special gift, but it was more than she could afford. However, the friendly shop owner agreed to wrap it and let her take it, with the agreement that she made weekly payments. When she thanked him and he replied, 'Oh, it's nothing,' that shop owner didn't realise the significance of his kind gesture. On October 4th, Officer David Schafer was pursuing an armed robber when he was shot in the stomach. When an officer went to tell his wife Terry, she was glad she hadn't waited for Christmas to give her husband his gift! And she was doubly grateful for the storekeeper who'd agreed to come to terms, otherwise David would be dead. Instead of a gunshot wound he was only bruised - because he'd been wearing the new bulletproof vest she'd given him earlier that week.
When the timing of an event is more remarkable than the event itself, some people say it's luck, fate, coincidence, or karma. But not King David: 'I come to you, Lord, for protection. Don't let me be ashamed. Do as you have promised and rescue me... Protect me from hidden traps and keep me safe. You are faithful and I trust you because you rescued me... I celebrate and shout because you are kind. You saw all my suffering, and you cared for me. You kept me from the hands of my enemies, and you set me free. (Psalm 31:1, 4-5, 7-8  CEV). 
Wherever you go today, remember that God's protective hand is upon you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT OFF YOUR OLD SELF...PUT ON THE NEW SELF.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:22-24 NIV</span><br>When you entertain certain thoughts in the privacy of your own mind you can be tempted to excuse yourself by saying, 'What harm will it do?' What harm? More than you know! Ultimately you become whatever you dwell on. Paul writes; 'Take captive every thought and make it obedient to Christ' (2 Corinthians 10:5). Take control of your thoughts or they'll take you places you don't want to go! 
Again Paul writes, 'Put off your old self...put on the new self.' You may not want to admit that you're still wearing those sad old clothes from your life before you met Jesus. Truth is, you can't put on a pukka new life 'til you first take off that shabby old attitude. And remember, with God there's no bottom drawer option; the old stuff goes in the bin, not in storage! 
Here's some really important words from the Bible, read them carefully: 'Stop telling lies...tell [your] neighbours the truth...Don't let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil. If you are a thief, quit stealing...use your hands for good hard work...give generously to others in need. Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be...helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them' (Ephesians 4:25-29 NLT). Pretty practical eh!?What else do you expect? When God's Spirit lives in you there's no need to:  a) lie in order to cover your back  2) cheat to get ahead  3) get moody when you don't get your own way 4) talk people down to make yourself seem better than you are. Those are all old clothes; bin 'em!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE...PLANS TO GIVE YOU THE FUTURE YOU HOPE FOR.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:11 TM</span><br>In Jeremiah 29:11 we have a great promise in a not-so-great chapter. So if things aren't going too well in your life at the moment, this verse is for you! 
Thousands and thousands of God's people had been dragged off to live as slaves in Babylon. Why? Because they majorly dissed God so he removed his protection from them. What a place to end up. Babylon was about as pagan as you could get. It wasn't the kind of place holy people hung out; it was a moral and spiritual mish-mash. And on top of that, back home the local preachers were making it up as they went along. Only Jeremiah was tuned in to God's true voice: 'Don't let all those so-called preachers and know-it-alls...take you in with their lies' (Jeremiah 29:8-9 TM). Deep in his soul he heard the voice of God saying, 'I still have a plan for you. It's not over till I say so. I'm going to turn things around for you. Your best days are ahead.' 
You say 'How do you know that God still has a plan for me?' Because you're still breathing! He has a plan for every single person He ever created, and it never goes out of date. Even if you've lost the plot for years, the plan can still swing into operation the moment you turn your life over to Him. The plan might be a bit modified from what it would've been if you'd paid attention earlier, but that doesn't stop God. He can adapt to fit anything that comes up, in any life that's ever lived; including yours. So, there's hope for you today!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A  FRIEND LOVES AT ALL TIMES.'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 17:17 NKJV</span><br>Today author John Maxwell tells us about friendship: 
'If you want deep, lasting friendship, you cannot always be the strong one. And that can be frightening; especially if you've had someone hurt or manipulate you. But you must let a friend see you in your weakness. Some of us have never done this, and we wonder why we're lonely. We're going to have to get vulnerable to have a true friend.'
'Friends serve each other. When's the last time you performed an act of servant-hood for a friend to whom you're devoted? If you can't remember, you're probably living with a core of loneliness. A friend is someone you commit to not because of what they can do for you, but just because they're your friend. And friends listen, even though they're busy. Listening is an act of love. It says 'I'm going to put my own agenda on hold and devote myself to knowing and caring for you.' Friends are not generally looking for someone who can talk very impressively or cleverly or with great wit. Mostly what they're looking for is a world-class listener. Furthermore, when something goes right, friends celebrate. Do you do that? When's the last time one of your friends had God bless them - and you threw a party? 
'If you're not in this kind of friendship right now, you can't make it happen, but you can open yourself up to it. You can start pursuing it. You can ask God to guide you. You can take little relational risks. And if you already have friends like this, prize them, protect them, enrich them in every way, and take that friendship as deep as you can.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NOT THAT I HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED THIS OR HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE GOAL... BUT I PRESS ON... FORGETTING WHAT LIES BEHIND AND STRAINING FORWARD TO WHAT LIES AHEAD</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:12-14 NRS</span><br>James says, 'We all make many mistakes' (James 3:2 NCV). Some of the mistakes we make are very public and get us into a lot of trouble.  Some of our mistakes are private and just leave us with an inner sense of disappointment at having let ourselves down again.  When you know you've failed, and when you're big enough to take it on the chin and not go blaming someone else for your mistake, you need to learn to forgive yourself. It's quite likely that you did the wrong thing - but you had the right motive. (Tony Blair can tell you all about that!) Here's how the process works: when you've admitted your mistake and learned your lesson you need to put it behind you and move on. Don't allow yourself to be chained to a past disaster. The Apostle Paul said, 'Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal... but I press on... forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,' (Philippians 3:12-14 NRS). What are you looking forward to? Do you spend as much time looking forward as you do looking back? Your future doesn't have to be absolutely perfect to be exciting and worthwhile. Writer and radio guy Chuck Swindoll writes: 'Show me the guy who wrote the rules for perfectionism, and I'll guarantee he's a nail biter with a face full of tics...whose wife dreads to see him come home.' God said, 'I...am he who blots away your sins...and will never think of them again' (Isaiah 43:25 TLB). Now, if God is ready to erase your mistakes, isn't it time you stopped beating yourself up, received His grace and moved on?

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SO WE CONTINUED THE WORK...FROM THE FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN TILL THE STARS CAME OUT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 4:21 NIV</span><br>Despite the fact that it was a virtually impossible job, Nehemiah rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem in just 52 days. How? Because of his single-minded passion to do it. Some of us are afraid to pray 'Lord, I'll do what you want me to do,' in case He sends us somewhere we don't want to go or asks us to do something we don't feel ready or qualified to do. You've got it wrong! The Bible says God's will is 'good, and acceptable, and perfect' (Romans 12:2). What is there to be afraid of in that formula? 
Now, while God's will for us is good it's not necessarily easy. But He gives us a passion for it. Jeremiah said that when he tried to quit speaking about the Lord, God's Word became 'like a burning fire shut up in my bones' (Jeremiah 20:9 NAS). You can't contain a fire that God lights. When He sets your heart ablaze you begin to see things you never saw before and get excited about them. He can even take the rubbish bits of your story and make them fantastic.
But it's not likely you'll experience much of a passion for anything if you're just sitting on the sidelines waiting for something to happen. James says 'Don't just be a hearer of God's word, be a doer' (see James 1:22). You'll get a passion for God's will once you begin doing it! You'll think 'this is what I was made for.' And when you have a compelling reason for doing something and know that God is watching and smiling on you, it makes all the difference.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANYONE WANTS TO BE FIRST, HE SHALL BE LAST OF ALL AND SERVANT OF ALL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 9:35 NAS</span><br>Dr Paul Brand was one of the 20th century's most respected doctors because of his work amongst lepers. His love for India's 'least of the least,' led him to pioneer surgical techniques that surgeons still use today in orthopaedic reconstruction. He was a brilliant surgeon, medical teacher, writer, speaker, and champion for the underdog. Top author Philip Yancey writes, 'Meeting Dr Brand, I realized I had misconstrued humility as a negative self-image. Paul Brand obviously knew his gifts: he had finished first throughout his academic career and had attended many awards banquets honouring his accomplishments. Yet he recognised his gifts as just that, &quot;gifts&quot; from a loving Creator, and used them in a Christ-like way of service. When I first met him, Brand was still adjusting to life in the United States. Everyday luxuries made him nervous and he longed for a simple life close to the soil. He knew presidents, kings and celebrities, yet he rarely mentioned them. He talked openly about his failures and always deflected credit for his successes to his associates. Most impressive to me, the wisest and most brilliant man I have ever met devoted much of his life to some of the lowliest people on the planet.'
Genuinely humble people try to help others - when there's nothing in it for them. They can do this because they're totally secure in who they are. They're aware of the things that make them successful at whatever they do. And that security - that honest, healthy self-assessment; results in a humble attitude; one that changes into actions which we can see, actions which make a difference, and a lifestyle we should want to follow.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF ANYONE WANTS TO BE FIRST, HE SHALL BE LAST OF ALL AND SERVANT OF ALL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 9:35 NAS</span><br>Humility or being humble is a quality that Jesus had. Notice two things:
1) Although it's a Christ-like quality, humility is rarely understood or admired. There are not many leaders around today who are humble very often, and normally when they are it's because they want something (like a politician doing a photoshoot serving tea to OAPs because they really want votes). Admitting you're weak or helping someone is thought of as letting people take advantage of you. Too many leaders view themselves as being there to be served, after all, they have worked their way up and deserve it! If people 'high up' mix too much with the lowly 'normal people' what will their friends think? You see it even in the school yard; the geeks are there to do the homework and the rest copy it down during break. Not so, for the follower of Christ. For them humility is not a religious concept, it's a way of life.
2) We appreciate humility in others, but rarely want it for ourselves. The price is too high. Humility is not what gets us ahead, and, let's be honest, we like humble people around because they're sweet and helpful and don't threaten us. They're safe people with a nice streak that keeps them on the sidelines during our scramble to the top of the hill. We can afford to be humble after we're king. Even Christ's disciples weren't immune: 'They...discussed with one another which of them was the greatest. Sitting down, He...said to them, &quot;If anyone wants to be first...he shall be servant of all&quot;' (Mark 9:34-35 NAS). Do you want to become more Christ-like? Practice humility!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE THE FATHER HAS LAVISHED ON US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:1 NIV</span><br>Nothing could make God love you more than He does right now: not greater achievement, greater beauty, greater recognition; not even greater spirituality. And nothing could make Him love you less: not your problems, your bad habits, your screw ups or just being you! The irony is, we spend our lives trying to earn a love that we can only received by faith when we realise and admit that there's an emptiness within us only God can fill. And He will. But the truth is, learning to live in the love of God is the challenge of a lifetime. 
Many of us grow up with parents who don't show their love to teach us when we've been bad or they're angry. And we think God does that too. But He doesn't. 'How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are' (1John 3:1 NIV). 
C S Lewis wrote: 'God did not make us because He was bored, lonely, or had run out of things to do. He created us to be the objects of His love! Sometimes our actions make us unlovely, but we are never unloved. And because God loves us we have value. And nobody can take that value away. God's love revealed at Calvary [Where Jesus died] fastens itself onto flawed creatures like us, and for reasons none of us can ever quite figure out, makes us precious and valued beyond calculation. This is love beyond reason. And this is the love with which God loves us.'  Are you convinced yet that He really loves you?!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT ON THE FULL ARMOUR OF GOD, SO THAT WHEN THE DAY OF EVIL COMES, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STAND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:13 NIV</span><br>The story is told of an overweight man who wanted to lose a few pounds. So he decided to change his route to work so that he wouldn't drive by his favourite doughnut shop. He told his mates at work about his decision. Then he arrived at work one morning with a huge bag of doughnuts. When his colleagues asked him about it he said, 'These are not ordinary doughnuts. They're from the Lord.' Amazed, they asked, 'What the heck are you talking about?' He replied, 'Well, it's simple. On my way to work I accidentally drove by my favourite doughnut shop and saw all those wonderful pastries sitting in the window. I knew I had to pray for strength so I said, 'Lord, if you want me to have any of these you're going to have to give me a parking place right in the front of the doughnut shop.' And sure enough, after eight trips around the block, there was a parking space right in the front!'
Count on it: you will face temptation every day. It's all part of growing in God and becoming a 'mature' Christian. Now, people who don't trust God are tempted too, but they don't have as much chance because they don't have the same weapons as us. God has provided us with spiritual armour, enabling us to suit up, stand up, show up for battle and win the day. So each morning when you get up, be sure to 'Put on the full armour of God' so when the doughnut shop comes along you can pass right by!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN DOES NOT WANT ANY OF THESE LITTLE ONES TO BE LOST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 18:14 TEV</span><br>In the opening scenes of the film Finding Nemo, Marlon and Coral - a pair of clown fish are watching their fish spawn grow like every proud fish parents would. At this point a massive evil fish comes along, attacks the mini marine family and all that's left is the father Marlon and his last surviving egg; who grows into Nemo. As Nemo grows up Marlon is hugely protective and in a rebellious streak one day, Nemo is captured and put into a dentist's marine fish tank. So what did Marlon do? Nemo isn't even in the sea anymore and there's no way Marlon can really rescue him. But, where most fathers would have stopped there and given up, Marlon chased. He swam across the sea from the Great Barrier Reef to Sydney Harbour. He was chased by sharks, swallowed by a whale, rode the East Australian Current with a bunch of turtles and somehow, found his way back to Nemo. He never gave up, even when things were at their bleakest. 
Maybe you've got a great dad who would cross the ocean to find you, or maybe you're dad wouldn't even notice you're gone. Maybe you no longer have a dad, either way, not many of us are blessed enough to have earthly fathers who would search an ocean for you - but your Heavenly Father would. No matter what your dad is like remember today that you've got a loving Father who has stopped at nothing to save you, even sacrificing His own son. As we honour fathers today, don't forget to give God all the love and praise He deserves.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE ACCUSER...HAS BEEN THROWN DOWN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 12:10 NAS</span><br>A man who worked in an office used to play a trick on new employees. He'd sneak up to them and whisper, 'They know what you did,' then walk away smiling. First, the person would look bewildered. Then they'd get well stressed and out panic as thoughts raced through their mind, 'Who are they?' 'What do they know?' 'What are they saying?' Solomon said, 'The wicked are edgy with guilt...even when no one's after them' (Proverbs 28:1 TM). And everybody is vulnerable; even the innocent tend to naturally protect themselves and conceal whatever they can. 
The Bible says that satan is called 'the accuser'. That means he spends his time trying to tell you rubbish, feed you lies, make you feel guilty, make you feel bad and worthless and it's simply not true! As a child of God you're free, blameless and pure. When doubts are whispered in your ear you have every right to stand up and say with confidence 'no, that's not true' and then tell those lies to 'do one'.
It's not God who's making you feel guilty; He wants you to know you're loved and forgiven. That's why Paul writes: 'Who dares accuse us who God has chosen for his own? Will Jesus? No, for he is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting at the place of highest honour next to God, pleading for us.' (Rom 8 v 34 NLT). 'And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love'. (Rom 8 v 38). Says it all really doesn't it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO SHALL BRING ANY CHARGE AGAINST GOD'S ELECT?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:33 AMP</span><br>Shame is one of the shady weapons satan will try to use against us. It can hold us back, hold us down and keep our eyes fixed on our feet. People can even use it to make us feel shame when we should be proud not embarrassed! The 'shame' of 'being a geek' can make you get into drink or drugs. The 'shame' of being a virgin can make you mess up big style. The 'shame' of being a Christian can make you quit God for good.
Being ashamed of who you are is like being constantly punished, except you're doing it to yourself! Even when you think you've managed to hide your thoughts, imaginations, attitudes and feelings, they come out in other ways. For example, shame-based people are easily offended, so others learn to walk on eggshells when they're around them. They are sometimes hard to confront and correct because they feel so bad about themselves that they hate to have anybody else highlight areas that need improvement. But God says only fools hate correction (see Proverbs15:5). When you're in right relationship with God you can accept instruction without becoming defensive. Paul says, 'Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?' Note the word 'elect:' God is voting for you (like in an election!). You're 'in.' Who can put you out? Nobody! God's Word says you are forgiven; your guilt and shame are gone, so stop saying how you feel and start talking about what you know! 
Above all, 'Keep Your eyes on Jesus...When you find yourself flagging' (Hebrews 12:2-3 TM). Make His unchanging opinion of you, your source of confidence and self-worth!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THERE IS...NO CONDEMNATION TO THOSE WHO  ARE IN CHRIST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:1 NIV</span><br>For the next few days we're going to focus in on some deeper issues that have a huge impact on our sense of confidence and self-worth. A well-known author writes: 'Because my father sexually abused me, I felt shame, which I internalised. At some point I made an unhealthy transition in my thinking. I was no longer ashamed of what he'd done...instead I became ashamed of myself...I felt like there was something wrong with me if my own father wanted to do those things. For years I had a message playing in my mind that said, &quot;What's wrong with me?&quot; That's one reason I was excited to learn that salvation clothed me in God's righteousness (see 2 Corinthians 5:21). For...years I felt wrong...now I finally feel right.'
Shame and depression go hand-in-hand. And while doctors can prescribe medication for depression, there's no medicine for shame; except the truth of God's love! But reading the Bible and not putting it into practise is like getting a prescription from a doctor and not taking it. James says, 'Do not merely listen to the word...Do what it says' (James 1:22 NIV). That means believing the truth of the Bible no matter how you may feel. Feelings change with your hormones, sleep patterns and circumstances; you can't trust them to tell you the truth. That's why the Bible says: 'Let God change the way you think. You will know what is good and pleasing to him (Romans 12:2 NCV). With Jesus there's no guilt, even when you've done wrong or been wronged. You say sorry and you are forgiven. So shake off your guilt and shame and begin to live!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN QUIETNESS AND IN CONFIDENCE SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 30:15 AMP</span><br>Disney's Chip and Dale always get the best of Donald Duck. In one episode the chipmunks are in a tree and Donald is trying to find ways to get to them. First he puts on spiked shoes and climbs the tree but Chip and Dale sneakily untie his shoes. Next he tries a ladder but the chipmunks push is away and down he falls. After that Donald tries a rocket but they manage to divert it and send him way off course. Finally, Donald has steam coming out of his ears and he starts to swing a large axe - trying to bring the tree right down. As the tree begins to fall it suddenly stops mid-air, then brings itself back upright. Donald is furious and the cartoon moves in on the chipmunks inside the tree, pushing against one side to bring it upright again. 
Now of course we know it's impossible to keep a tree upright by pushing on the inside, but those guys were about to lose everything and in that fight to survive they achieved the impossible. Fair point, it's just a cartoon, but there are many times in our own lives when it looks as though the tree is going to fall, parts of our lives are going totally wrong and it looks as though there's no way out. Those are the times that all we have to lean and rely upon is our faith in God. By placing our confidence entirely in him and having a desperation to survive, that's when God can do the impossible. Those situations in life may be the hardest times but when we're weakest God can really show us who's in control.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU HAVE LEFT YOUR FIRST LOVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 2:4 NAS</span><br>The Church in Ephesus was the kind of church you'd want to be at: 'I know your deeds and your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men...You have...endured hardships for my name and have not grown weary' (Revelation 2:2 NIV). So far so good. But then there's a snag: 'I have this against you,' says the Lord. 'You have left your first love.' Ouch! 
The Church had started out as passionate evangelists, lovers of the poor and needy. They probably had awesome worship times, exciting preaching and were known for being packed with vision, excitement and a fiery, head-over heels love for God. So what happened? The Bible says, 'You have left your first love'. Their hearts had cooled down and the fire was on its way out, and they didn't even realise! These guys were living the life, serving the poor and doing everything by the book, but it was all done out of a sense of duty. How sad. 
Our relationship with God is the single most important thing in our lives. Without spending time with the God we love the fire is doomed to go out. A fire needs fuel, the more the fuel the greater the blaze! The sad truth is that there are many Christians who go to church every week - without fail. They pray, they read their Bible every single day - yet they don't truly love God. Loving God is a commitment, a decision, an attitude resulting in action - a decision to include Him in all you say and do. So, do you love God? How are you going to show it today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAKE A CAREFUL EXPLORATION OF WHO YOU ARE...THEN SINK YOURSELF INTO THAT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:4 TM</span><br>Are you living as God wanted, or are you struggling to live up to other people's expectations? What would happen if you just dropped your mask and got real?
There's a children's story called 'The Velvet Rabbit' that has a classic message for each of us. In a conversation between a new toy rabbit and a tatty old leather horse. Rabbit asks, 'What's real? Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?'  'Real isn't how you're made,' replied Horse, 'It's a thing that happens to you when a child really loves you.' 'Does it hurt?' asked the Velvet Rabbit. 'Sometimes,' said Horse. 'But when you're real you don't mind.'  'Does it happen all at once?' he asked. 'It doesn't' said Horse, 'It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, have sharp edges, or have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you're real most of your hair has been loved off, your eyes drop out, you get loose in the joints and very flabby. But these things don't matter because once you're real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.' 
King David said, 'You made my whole being...in an amazing...way' (Psalms139:13-14 NCV). Becoming real means accepting yourself and being who you were made to be whether that's physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Unless you understand who you are - who God made you, you'll constantly feel like a let-down and spend your life trying to please others - trying to be something or someone else. Let God show you today who he made you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU ARE A CHOSEN PEOPLE...TO TELL...THE WONDERFUL ACTS OF GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 2:9 NCV</span><br>Raised in a family full of arguments and money problems, Richy Stearns decided that education was his ticket out. Scholarships and hard work got him into a top University, then earned him a Masters Degree in business. Rich took to the corporate world like a duck to water and he eventually became the CEO (top dog) for Parker Brothers and Lenox China. He had it all: big house, nice family and secure job. So why did he still feel unfulfilled? He knew what his skill was: management. He knew where to use it: big organisations. But why? He considered becoming a missionary but didn't see how God could use someone whose strengths were budgets and flow charts. In 1998 when global relief charity World Vision invited him to be their CEO, he declined. It would be career suicide to take a 75% pay cut and move his family across the country! But World Vision persisted. When board member Bill Hybels told Rich, 'This is a chance to marry your gifts with God's call...to enter the zone in which you were made to live,' Rich prayed, weighed his options, and accepted. 
Looking back Rich Stearns says, 'This is the fulfilment of who I was created to be...I've found my stride...I wonder why I waited 23 years.' And World Vision has no regrets either. During his first six years their annual budget doubled, making it the largest relief organisation in the world. It's amazing what happens when you use your gifts 'to tell...the wonderful acts of God.' So, what are you doing with your gifts?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 34:8</span><br>In 'A Box of Delights,' J John and Mark Stibbe share these slightly random thoughts. 'You know... you're addicted to coffee when: you are employee of the month at the local coffee house and you don't even work there... your eyes stay open when you sneeze...you chew on other people's fingernails...you can type sixty words per minute with your feet...you can jump-start your car without cables...you don't sweat, you percolate...you've worn out the handle on your favourite coffee mug...you walk twenty miles on your treadmill before you realise it's not hooked up...you've worn the finish off your coffee table...you're so wired, you pick up radio signals...your birthday is a national holiday in Brazil...you go to sleep just so you can wake up and smell the coffee...you name your cats 'Cream' and 'Sugar'...your lips are permanently stuck in the sipping position...you have a picture of your coffee mug on your coffee mug...you don't tan, you roast...you don't get mad, you get steamed... you think CPR stands for 'coffee provides resuscitation'...you ski uphill...you get a speeding ticket even when you're parked... you just completed another sweater and you don't even know how to knit.' 
The Bible says, 'Taste and see that the Lord is good.' While it may be a few years before you're taking coffee breaks with colleagues at Starbucks, here's an idea. Why not turn your break time into a time with God. Carry a 'Word 4 U 2day' and a pocket Bible with you. Use these short breaks to chill out with God. It could change your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT LOVE THE WORLD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 2:15 NAS</span><br>John writes, 'Do not love the world.' But what does that mean? First, let's look at what it doesn't mean. It doesn't mean being so holy that you live on another planet. Loving the Lord more doesn't mean loving those around you less; or feeling awkward around them; or losing touch with them; or not knowing how to talk to them; or getting their backs up because they're not as 'holy' as you. If 'we have the mind of Christ'  (1 Corinthians 2:16) shouldn't we be as attractive to a lost world as Jesus was?
As the world of finance, politics, education and entertainment, etc gets more off track, we have two choices: condemn it or influence it! Become what we're supposed to be, light! It's the end of the game and Jesus, the Manager, is calling His best players onto the field. Isaiah the prophet spoke into the lives of kings. The three Hebrew children changed the politics of Babylon. Joseph the economist saved Egypt from famine. Yes, satan is at work taking Christ out of Christmas, prayer out of schools, and God out of government. But he won't win, and he knows it. His strategy, however, is to convince you that he can win. He doesn't want you to see the real battle between light and darkness. He doesn't want you to feel a sense of urgency and personal responsibility. But the God who promised to 'crush satan under your feet' is raising up a generation of spirit-empowered believers who will demonstrate what it's like to live in a different kingdom. Are you part of it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOUR PRAYERS AND GIFTS TO THE POOR HAVE COME UP AS A [CONSTANT REMINDER] BEFORE GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 10:4 NIV</span><br>The things you do for others don't go unnoticed. God is keeping track of every single one. He 'doesn't miss anything. He knows...the love you've shown...by helping' (Hebrews 6:10 TM). God heard the kind words you spoke to that person yesterday who was hurting. He saw your sacrificial giving last week when you were totally skint. By doing what you did you paved the way for God to help you. He's storing it all up so that in your time of need you'll have a rich account to draw on. 
The Bible speaks about a Roman soldier named Cornelius, a 'good man...always helping people in need' (Acts 10:2 TM). And what happened to Cornelius? His family became the first non-Jewish household to hear and receive the gospel. The bible describes vividly the way the Holy Spirit arrived powerfully in their lives. What a payoff! Why did God pick Cornelius? Because of his generous spirit, 'An angel...came to him and said...'Your...gifts...have come up as a [constant reminder] before God.''
A lady was starting a pet grooming business but couldn't afford to advertise. So she went to her local animal shelter and volunteered to groom the pets in order to help increase their chances for adoption. Interestingly, the harder she worked the more her own business grew by word of mouth. Finally she ended up with more clients than she could handle! Does that mean if you don't help others God won't help you? No, thankfully His love is unconditional. But a missed opportunity to give is a missed opportunity to receive, because when you're generous with others God promises to be generous with you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE WORLD OF THE GENEROUS GETS LARGER AND LARGER; THE WORLD OF THE STINGY GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 11:24-25 TM</span><br>One reason the Dead Sea is a big tourist attraction is because it's got such high mineral concentrations that even non swimmers can stay afloat in its waters. The only problem is the foul smell; because nothing flows out, any fresh water that comes in turns salty and stays there. Solomon said, 'The world of the generous gets larger and larger; the world of the stingy gets smaller and smaller.' We're not supposed to be like reservoirs that just take in and hold water; He called us to be rivers that flow out to bless others. Something interesting happens when you stop focusing on yourself and get concerned with other people's needs. Paul says, 'A person who gives cheerfully...will...have...plenty left ...to share' (2 Corinthians 9:7-8 NLT). 
If you want to grow you've got to sow! When the Macedonian church was 'tested by great troubles, and...very poor...they gave... much...more than they could afford' (2 Corinthians 8:2-3 NCV). These people understood that when you invest in the lives of others, God totally blesses you too. It's a principle that flows against the tide of our me-centred consumerist world. 
So how might you put this principle into practice?  Well, if for example you need a job, volunteer for a charity while you're looking for work. The Bible says when you 'Give generously...your gifts will return to you later,' plus, 'In the days ahead you yourself may need...help' (Ecclesiastes 11:1-2 TLB). Even if you don't have a specific need right now, sow a good seed anyway. Only God knows what the future holds, and one day when you need it the most it'll come back to bless you with a harvest.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS ONE THING I DO</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:13</span><br>If you're only good at one thing, make that one thing the only thing you need! To make the most of your life:
1) maximise what God has given you. Light bulb inventor Thomas Edison set himself a big goal: to come up with a major new invention every six months and a minor one every ten days. When he died he had 1,093 patents. Edison made his dreams a reality by sticking to what he did best. 
2) start where God put you. After losing a baseball game, cartoon character Charlie Brown pours out his heart to his friend Lucy: 'All my life I've dreamed of pitching in the big leagues, but I'll never make it!' Lucy replies 'You're thinking too far ahead, Charlie Brown. Set yourself more immediate goals. Start with the next inning, for example. When you go out to pitch, see if you can walk to the mound...without falling down.' Success starts with one step at a time. 
3) focus on what God called you to do. Music was everything to Brahms. He studied music going right back to the 15th century. He worked day and night to perfect his craft, refusing to publish anything that didn't meet his high standards. That's why he didn't publish his first symphony until he was 40. And he never married, saying it would distract him: 'I am in love with music, I think of nothing but, and of other things only when they make music more beautiful.' Is that madness? No, it's focus; it's what makes your life count! It's why Paul said, 'This one thing I do.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO...DESPISES THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ZECHARIAH 4:10 AMP</span><br>While the world values the sensational and stunning, God loves to work through the ordinary and insignificant. In His Kingdom, bigger isn't always better. Back in the dark times of the Judges God gave Gideon victory over the Midianites. With God's help this complete no-hoper led an army of just 300 to beat a powerful enemy hundreds of thousands strong. That wasn't because there weren't enough soldiers; God just wanted to show His power in 'the day of small things.' Jesus could have chosen any number of followers, but He hand picked just 12 to reach the world with the Gospel. On a mountain He fed 5,000 people with five rolls and two fish from a kid's lunch box. There's no minimum requirement where God's concerned! 
Jesus said, 'Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much' (Luke 16:10 NIV). So if you're waiting for God to make you bigger instead of better, you'll probably be waiting for a very, very long time. All the prayers in the world won't pressure Him into giving you what you're not ready to handle. God's far more bothered about you becoming better through your character and relationship with Him than bigger through doing more things. Trying to be bigger all the time can wear you out and stop you from enjoying what God's actually given you. Better may be harder to measure and not as glamorous, but in the long run you'll be stronger, experienced and a heck of a lot more stable. Ask God today to point out to you where you need to get the bigger vs better balance back in order.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ONE THING I ASK OF THE LORD, THIS IS WHAT I SEEK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 27:4 NIV</span><br>If you're really serious about getting somewhere with God, start by having a think what's stopping you. That takes a bit of honesty. The first job is dealing with the rubbish we fill our heads with. Here's a few examples of head rubbish:  
1) daydreaming! Listen, seriously, daydreaming and generally going about life with a head filled with imaginary conversations, beautiful thoughts, dream scenarios and exciting fantasies is not living! Ok, reality may sometimes be dull but if you need to escape think about the future, who you want to be, ask God for his dreams. Ladies, this may sound harsh but Shayne Ward is not going to ask you out, so forget it! And fellas, why are you watching Hollyoaks? - it definitely isn't for the clever storyline!
2) sports and hobbies. This is hard to believe but there are more important things in the world than football and hockey. If you spend way more time talking about your favourite hobby than anything else, how about trying to put a limit on it?   
3) gossip. It's impossible not to talk about other people, we're surrounded by them and they're involved in just about every single subject one way or another. But, think about what you're saying. Before you speak think, 'would I say it if they were in the room?' If not, keep your mouth shut! Remember though, use that rule wisely. It doesn't mean it's ok to be horrible just because you're happy to be horrible to their face too!  
Be disciplined with your mind. You can control your thoughts and what you think about is entirely your decision!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIRIT IN YOU IS...STRONGER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 4:4 TM</span><br>When a diving injury left Joni Eareckson totally paralysed from the neck down, her world was totally shattered. She didn't know what was ahead and her first reaction was to look for a quick way out. But her second response, from deep inside, was a desire to live. She learned to paint holding a brush in her mouth, and later went to university for a public-speaking course which inspired her to talk about what she knew best: life in a wheelchair, and her experience as a follower of Jesus. Later a businessman sponsored an exhibition of her art it launched her successful career as an artist. Each piece included a testimony about her relationship with Jesus. When she made a list of her heart's desires she wrote: 'It's time to step out...into a new dream. To be a 'doer' of God's Word...and help other disabled people with dreams of their own.' 
From that desire was born 'Joni and Friends,' a ministry that brings together people of faith and people with a disability, sponsors workshops and offers financial help. Joni's also on a National Council for Disability and has her own radio programme which is broadcast to millions of people. She's also married and is a popular speaker who has written 30 books! She says: 'I don't know what lies ahead. But I do know who I am. I have a dream, and I know where I'm going.'
John writes, 'The Spirit in you is...stronger than anything in the world.' The question is, when life hands you a lemon what do you do? Complain it's too sour and feel sorry for yourself or are you busy making lemonade?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST...JESUS THE SON OF GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 4:14-16 NAS</span><br>Have you ever read the Old Testament and thought 'Phew, God was really scary back then, I'm glad He's nice no'?' Well, although God can seem quite different, (He was a bit scary!) we sometimes forget He's the same God, He never changed! So how come we don't fear Him the way the Israelites used to? Back in the Old Testament the Israelites were so far from God; because they were only human and He is infinite; that they used to have a High Priest who was the go-between. He acted as a bridge between people and God, High Priests were very Holy Joes! Back in the OT Job was having a pretty rough time and wanted God to lay off him a bit, but he felt he needed someone like a High Priest to be the middle-man between him and God. 'God is not a man like me, so I cannot answer him. We cannot meet each other in court. I wish there were someone to make peace between us, someone to decide our case..' (Job 9:32-33 NCV). So if God is the same God today, and we have no High Priest, how come we're able to come to Him?  Because of Jesus! Jesus became the new High Priest, the middle-man, the one to fight our corner, come to our defence and pray for us. He can understand what we're going through when we cry out to Him, and He has the power to act on our behalf. When you know that you understand you can take anything to Jesus with total confidence that He's on your side.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GIVE, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:38 NIV</span><br>Mother Teresa wrote: 'One night a man came to our house and said, 'There's a family of eight children who haven't eaten for days.' I took some food and went to see them. When I got there I saw the faces of little children disfigured by malnutrition. There was no sadness there, just the pain of hunger. I gave a sack of rice to the mother. She kept one half and went out carrying the other. When she came back I asked, 'Where did you go?' She answered, 'To my neighbours, they're hungry also.' I wasn't surprised that she gave, the poor are usually very generous. But I was surprised that she knew they were hungry. As a rule, when we're suffering we're so focused on our own problems that we have no time for others.' That's the law of paying it forward! It teaches you that: a) the chain of blessing goes on and on. Jesus said: 'Give, and it will be given to you' (Luke 6:38 NIV). Every seed has potential for multiplication b) what you do for others affects what God does for you. 'Knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord' (Ephesians 6:8 NKJV) c) giving is vital to your future, but you must be willing to let go. 'How?' you ask. By finding a vision bigger than yourself and pouring your life into it! When you do that you discover two things:  
1) it's okay to have limitations as long as you don't allow them to make you introverted  2) that the way to not become introverted is to always be on the lookout for someone to give to!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR THE SINFUL NATURE DESIRES WHAT IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:17 NIV</span><br>Do you ever feel like there's a fight going on between your flesh and your spirit? If so, what can you do about it? a) admit that there is a battle! Your flesh will always crave satisfaction in lots of things God hates. In this way there is a war going on, unless your flesh takes a holiday (which isn't going to happen is it!) b) recognise that you're powerless to win without God's help! By submitting to God you start to draw on His strength as each temptation comes across your path. The closer you draw to God, the stronger you become when faced with temptation c) decide that discipline is a personal matter! You can't depend on anyone else to develop it for you. Paul writes, 'I run...I box...I discipline my body' (1 Corinthians 9:26-27 NAS). Other people can be your inspiration but only you can actually put the effort in d) understand that ignoring the consequences of your actions is a recipe for disaster! Lack of self-discipline will inevitably lead to embarrassment for you, and those you love. So before you give in, consider the fallout! In 1 Corinthians 9:27 Paul speaks about being 'disqualified.' What does that mean? It means losing respect in the eyes of others. It means limiting God's ability to use you for His purposes. It means hurting the cause of Christ in the eyes of a world that's always watching. When David committed adultery with Bathsheba, Nathan the prophet said to him, 'By doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt' (2 Samuel 12:14 NIV). Want to win the battle? Keep these things in mind!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NO ONE CAN COME TO ME UNLESS THE FATHER... DRAWS HIM TO ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 6:34 NCV</span><br>Coming home from the pub late one night Geoff got on a bus and was extremely surprised to bump into his very religious auntie. Rather scarily she said, 'Do you know you're headed straight to hell?' 'Oh dear,' he said, 'Don't tell me I caught the wrong bus again!' Seriously, we all want our families to share our faith, but it can't be forced. Jesus said, 'You're not in charge...The Father...draws people...that's the only way [they'll] ever come' (John 6:44 TM). Does that mean you should stop praying for the members of your family who don't know Jesus? Should you stop looking for opportunities to share the gospel with them? Of course not! But despite your passionate prayers and well chosen words there may still be family members who decide not to follow Jesus. Throughout history too many wars have been fought over religion; don't turn your home into a combat zone as well. 
You don't have to approve of somebody's lifestyle in order to let them know you love them and are committed to them. You must never withhold your affection and acceptance from those who've been good to you just because they don't worship God the way you do. Maybe they haven't always made the wisest choices, but when the rubber hits the road, chances are, they are the ones who'll be there for you. Don't beat them over the head with the Bible; just live it by setting an example they'll want to follow. Jesus said, 'If I am lifted up...I will draw all people' (John 12:32 NCV). Instead of tearing your family apart, make your faith the glue that holds it together.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY, DO NOT SIN, AND BE SURE TO STOP BEING ANGRY BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:26 NCV</span><br>God doesn't deny us the right to our emotions, but He does hold us accountable for how we handle them. That means we don't get into the habit of using those nearest and dearest to us as emotional punch bags. Paul said, 'Don't sin by letting anger control you...anger gives a foothold to the devil.' Satan would like nothing better than to wriggle his way into your home, then turn it into a living hell. And every time you fly off the handle you make more space for his bitter influence. Does your home need less hot words and more cool heads? King Solomon said, 'People with quick tempers show their foolishness' (Proverbs 14:29 NCV). It's okay to share your feelings, but you need to learn to do it the right way; the way that doesn't have everyone walking on eggshells when they're around you. Surely you realised by now that the issue is never who's right or wrong, (or who can shout the loudest), it's about finding the answer that's best for everyone. 
Nobody can be everything you want them to be, all the time. It's impossible to have a long-term, loving relationship without learning to accept human weaknesses. So, instead of focusing on your family's failures, focus on your collective strength. Psychologist Dr Paul Pearsall says, 'Most of us would give our lives for a family member. Yet too often we live our daily life as if we take our families for granted.' Learn to bite your lip; your family is worth it. Why would you want to wind up the people God's placed to be there for you in the past, in the present and into your future?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE HUMBLE, GENTLE AND PATIENT, ACCEPTING EACH OTHER IN LOVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS:2-3 NCV</span><br>We're going on a trip way back in history today; nearly 4000 years. Nearing the end of his life, the time when, by tradition he should have been blessing his sons Simeon and Levi, Jacob spoke these sad words to them: 'I...curse...you because of your...anger' (Genesis 49:7 NIV). But their behaviour should've been no surprise to him, the fact is, Jacob had already shaped them by his own example when he conned his dad (see Genesis 27) and his father-in-law (see Genesis 30). Even worse, his mum (their Grandma) deliberately covered his tracks. Talk about a shady past! Behavioural patterns are passed from generation to generation, which is why the Bible points out how important it is for parents to 'Train children how to live right, and when they are old, they will not change' (Proverbs 22:6 NCV). What are the important things your parents have passed on to you so far that might be stepping-stones onto that 'right path'? Maybe, if you pick the right moment, you could let your mum or dad know; they'd be well blessed to hear you bigging up their parenting. Do you know that loads of parents are really insecure? They worry loads about whether or not they're doing a good job. Remember the Jesus way of life; are you going to be like the stereotypical stroppy teenager who just complains about everything? Take some advice from David who prayed, 'Set a guard over my mouth, LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips' (Psalm 141:3-4 NIV). Today you can create a new atmosphere in your family just by opening your mouth and saying something surprising!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE HUMBLE, GENTLE AND PATIENT, ACCEPTING EACH OTHER IN LOVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS:2-3 NCV</span><br>If there's one thing that ought to be obvious to anyone who has taken more than just a passing glance at the Bible it's this: God is into families! So, if God's into families then it won't do us any harm to spend a few days looking at the subject together will it?
There aren't many people who really believe that the 'perfect family' actually exists these days but even the idea of a 'normal' family is really hard to pin down too! The traditional 'happy family' consisting of hard-working dad, stay-at-home mum, 2.4 kids, dog, cat and a house with bushy privet hedge has become the exception, when it used to be the rule. For many people family means money problems, mixed-up kids and stressed-out parents. 
With all this in mind, Paul's words are spot on: 'Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love.' Because we're all imperfect human beings it takes a great big dose of grace to make a family work! You won't always agree, but you need to learn to respect each other. You may have heard it said that every family has its ups and downs and every family tree produces a few nuts! But, all joking aside, when there are more serious difficulties the bailing out option begins to look like a real possibility as you get older and more independent. Don't be hasty. You may need some space but running away is never the answer. When you were a baby you didn't choose your family; but today you can. Why not pause right now and ask God to help you see your family through His eyes.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHO HAS ENTERED HEAVEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 4:14 NAS</span><br>Here's two bits of cultural history for you... 
1) Once a year Israel's High Priest would walk through the two outer areas of the temple and go into the 'Holy of Holies' to receive God's forgiveness for the people's sins. There were lots of priests, but only the High Priest could do this. The Bible says that Jesus is our High Priest, but he doesn't need to enter a holy room somewhere on earth in order to make requests to God. No, the Bible tells us 'Christ Jesus died, but he was also raised from the dead, and now he is on God's right side, begging God for us' (Romans 8:34 NCV) 
2) One day during the American Civil War a soldier sat on a bench outside the White House in Washington DC looking pretty distressed. A little boy came by and asked him what was wrong. The soldier said he needed to see President Lincoln but the guards at the door wouldn't let him in. Hearing this, the boy took him by the hand and led him directly into the President's office. 'Father,' he said, 'this soldier really needs to speak with you.' That boy was the President's son, who could always open the door to see his father.
You get it now don't you?! Sometimes to understand what the Bible is trying to tell us we have to frame it in a situation we find easier to picture. Jesus is the way to the Father, He can bypass all the stuff that blocks us. That's why when we pray in Jesus' name, we have direct access to God.  We are welcome in His presence, isn't that amazing!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ON HIS LAW THEY MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALMS 1:2 RSV</span><br>Isn't meditation a bit dodgy; something only monks and mystics do? Why would anyone want to get down in the 'lotus position' and hum some funny tunes? Well obviously that's not the kind of meditation the Bible talks about! Answer this; do you know how to worry? Okay, then you know how to meditate, because meditating is just reverse worry. When you meditate you concentrate on thoughts that will make you feel great about the future - not stressed about it. The focus of Christian meditation is God's word. You take a passage, for example, a saying of Jesus, then you: a) think deeply and continuously about it  b) let it take root deep in your memory  c) 'own' it, until it becomes a strength within you. 
There are a lot of people who can spout a hundred Bible verses one after another but they do nothing to make the world a better place! The point isn't how much Scripture you can memorise, but what happens to you in the process of internalising it. Meditating on God's word clarifies and corrects you; it enriches and equips you by making space for you to think different thoughts than if you were watching TV! 
David said, 'I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you' (Psalm 119:11 NIV). Meditating on God's Word is the cure for:  a) spiritual weakness   b) life without focus  c) lack of intimacy with God  d) distractions that cause you to keep missing God's best. 
So crack open your Bible today and ask, 'Lord, what are you saying to me?' Then wait for His answer.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU SEEM TO THINK GOD'S CHURCH IS NOT IMPORTANT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 11:22 NCV</span><br>For a lot of people in our country church is just a place to wet your head, get you wed and pronounce you dead! Do you know anyone like that? You probably do, but before you go tut-tutting at them just take a minute to look at yourself. How strong is your passion for your local church? Are you always talking about what's wrong with it or are you coming up with ideas to make it better? Did you know that the church is Jesus' personal project. Jesus actually said this, 'I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it' (see Matt 16:18). 
Jay Kessler, who was President of Youth For Christ, says this about the church: a) It's the only organization that deals with the issues: like salvation, death, judgment, grace, purpose, heaven and hell   b) it adds value and dignity to human life. We live in a culture that creates a sense of worthlessness. The church counteracts this negative message with God's love and acceptance c) it provides a moral and spiritual compass. Society has rejected absolutes but the church stands on the timeless bedrock of God's Word  d) it's where you find compassion, healing and community. It's the place where we're all equal (see Galatians 3:28 and Colossians 3:11). In the church; God's Spirit is working to knit us together, providing us with 'equal access to the Father' (Ephesians 2:18 TM)  e) it has motivated the most lasting, unselfish, courageous endeavours on earth, such as  schools, hospitals, rehab centres and orphanages. But most important is the fact that Jesus Himself 'is the head...Everything comes from him...So in all things Jesus has first place' (Colossians 1:18 NCV).

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Avoid sexual immorality.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Thessalonians 4:3-4 NIV</span><br>Sex wasn't a mistake God made when He was a bit distracted! God doesn't want to wipe out your desire for some lurrrve - but He wants you to enjoy it the way He designed it. You see, when we don't understand God's original intent for sex, things go pear shaped!
Saying 'I'm reserving sex for marriage' tends to drop a few jaws and leave you in the kitchen at a few parties. So what! Despite what you see in the movies and mags, when there's physical intimacy without true commitment, count on it -  somebody's going to get hurt. You need to check out God's Word, talk to your youth leader, be honest with yourself and make up your mind. And you need to do it now, you need to know where to draw the line before you get to the party or start snogging that special someone because then you've waited too late, your feelings will take control!  
We all struggle at times with our sexuality, particularly in today's culture. Sex is such a deep part of us. And guilt about sex has a way of making us feel separated from God like nothing else. So in order to determine your values and set some ground rules, you need to vow before God, 'I'm not going to allow my impulses to dictate to me, or sin to separate me from You. I choose to keep Your standards, to rely on Your Spirit to give me strength day by day; and if I do sin, to seek Your forgiveness, get back up and move closer to You.' Count on it; that's a prayer God will answer!

<title><![CDATA[The benefits of humility]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 5:5 NAS	</span><br>Peter writes 'all of you, clothe yourselves with humility...for God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you (1 Peter 5:5-7 NAS). Peter expressed four very important thoughts to help us. And he combined them for a reason. Let's look at each: 
1) 'All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another.' Peter's expression 'clothe yourselves with humility' referred to an apron typically worn by servants. That's because we're called to be servants, not celebrities! The word 'All' lets us know we all stand on an equal footing before the cross. 
2) 'God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.' Those who are self-centred find themselves at odds with God, while the humble enjoy His blessings. 
3) 'Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time.' The phrase 'The mighty hand of God' is used in Scripture to symbolize two things: God's hand of discipline, and His hand of deliverance. And you need both. So submit to His discipline today and you'll experience His deliverance. 
4) 'Casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.' Peter addresses the core issue; our worry that if we don't look out for ourselves nobody else will. But if we really believe that God 'cares for us,' we needn't worry about serving our own interests. We can focus on the needs of others, confident that God will spare nothing when it comes to meeting our needs.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Through faith in him we may approach God with... confidence.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 3:12 NIV </span><br>Did you know that you can pray in your mind without having to speak a word out loud? All of us know the power of unspoken communication. Many of us have grown up with parents who didn't have to say a thing to make their will known. It may have been the way they'd tilt their heads, a certain look in their eyes or some other signal; but whatever it was, we knew exactly what was being communicated and how we were expected to respond. 
Our goal in prayer should be to maintain such a close relationship with God that we can communicate back and forth no matter what the situation, the time of day, or anything else. And we don't have to shout, or use the right words in the right order, because our hearts are in tune with God's heart.
It's like the story of the little boy who wanted a bicycle for Christmas. He was praying one night at the top of his voice, telling God the colour of bike he wanted. His mum said, 'Son, you don't need to shout for God to hear you.' He replied, 'I know, mum, but I need to shout if grandpa's going to hear me and buy me that bike!' The truth is, we don't need to shout for God to hear us and we don't need to try and make our own answers to prayer happen either. Jesus said our Heavenly Father knows what we need before we ask. He gives to us because of our relationship with Him, not just because we say it at a decibel level loud enough to be heard in heaven!

<title><![CDATA[The tug of God's love]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God's Spirit touches our spirits and confirms who we really are. We know who he is, and we know who we are: Father and children</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:16 TM</span><br>The story is told of an atheist spending a quiet day fishing when his boat is attacked by the Loch Ness monster. The beast tosses him and his boat high into the air, then it opens its mouth to swallow them both. The man cries out 'Oh my God, help me!' Suddenly the attack scene freezes in place. As the atheist hangs in mid air a voice shouts from heaven, 'I thought you didn't believe in Me!' The man replies 'Come on God, give me a break! Two minutes ago I didn't believe in the Loch Ness monster either!' 
In this life what we choose believe and not believe is massively important. The famous evangelist, Billy Graham says, 'Whenever anyone asks me how I can be so certain about whom and what God really is, I'm reminded of the story of the little boy who was out flying a kite. The wind was brisk and large billowing clouds were blowing across the sky. The kite went up and up until it was entirely hidden by the clouds. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; a man asked the little boy. &quot;I'm flying my kite,'&quot; he replied. &quot;Flying your kite?&quot; the man said. &quot;How can you be sure? You can't see the kite.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the little boy, &quot;I can't see it, but every little while I feel a tug, so I know for sure it's there!'''
Don't take anyone else's word for it. Find God for yourself by inviting Jesus Christ into your life. Then you too will know by the unmistakeable tug on your heart which assures that He's real, and that He lives in you.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God...will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 10:13 NAS</span><br>In the wilderness satan offered Jesus three things (see Luke 4). He also offers them to you:  1) satisfaction! Jesus was hungry and satan tempted Him to turn stones into bread. This was satisfaction without God, because God's plan was to feed His Son supernaturally through angels. But Jesus refused to settle for less - and so should you!  
2) success! Taking Jesus to the top of the temple, satan said 'Jump off, God will protect You and everyone will believe in You.' This was an offer of success without the cross, the easy way out! And hasn't satan made you that same offer: 'You don't have to take up your cross daily like the bible says.' satan lied then, and he's lying to you now.  3) significance! Satan offered Jesus the kingdoms of this world and their glory if He'd just bow down to him. Jesus rebuked him with a reminder from Scripture that God alone is worthy of being glorified. 
Satan will take every legitimate desire you have and try to get you to fulfil it in an illegitimate way.  He will offer short cuts and easy answers that aren't part of God's plan. But God 'will provide the way of escape.' You say 'I don't see the way of escape.' That's because you're focused on the temptation instead of the way out. God's promise of escape doesn't mean you won't have to persevere and be faithful to Him. And, as in the case of Christ, it involves knowing and being able to use the Scriptures. But it does mean that when God's plan of victory over temptation has been fulfilled, you'll come out victorious!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be...complete, lacking nothing.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:4 NKJV</span><br>Just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean God has changed His mind. While you are waiting, God is working. The timing may not be right for Him to get the ultimate glory, and you the maximum benefit. That's why the Bible says: 'Let patience have it's perfect work, that you may be perfect [mature]...lacking nothing.'
Impatience is a sign of immaturity. Children can't wait for anything! So, are you being childish or showing maturity? God sets His watch to accomplish His purpose, not ours. Paul writes: 'We know that all things work...according to his purpose' (Romans 8:28 paraphrase). We need to be asking God about his plans and purpose. When you understand God's purpose you won't allow things to get in the way of it. That includes hurry and worry. You'll also know how to spend your time, your energy and your money, who you should spend your life with and who you shouldn't.
God says, 'I make known the end from the beginning' (Isaiah 46:10 NIV). First God sets the goal, and then He determines the steps that lead to it. What are we supposed to do while we are waiting? Listen: 'Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Saviour' (Habakkuk 3:17 NIV). 
Begin thanking God today for what He's done, and what He's going to do on your behalf, because He absolutely will come through for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You have stayed long enough at this mountain.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 1:6 NIV</span><br>A teenager was telling a pensioner why the older generation doesn't understand the younger. 'You grew up in a primitive world,' he said. 'We've got space travel, nuclear energy and computers.' Smiling, the old man replied, 'You're right, we didn't have those things, that's why we invented them!'  In other words, the reason we are where we are now is because someone went first and made it possible! 
So, what are you doing to break the mould and do something new? Sometimes we have to smash the barriers that are holding us back. To get beyond your mental barriers you must stop saying things like, 'That's just the way I am,' or, 'My family never amounted to much, so I won't either.' No, you're contradicting God! God said, 'I will pour my Spirit into your descendants and my blessing on your children' (Isaiah 44:3 TM)
When God rescued Israel from Egypt and they headed for the Promised Land, a journey that should have taken 11 days took 40 years. They ended up circling the same mountain repeatedly because they'd been oppressed so long that mentally they couldn't grasp what God had prepared for them. Finally He told them, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain...take possession of the land...the Lord swore he would give to your...descendants.' If your history (or even your family's) is one of failure and despair, rise up and say, 'Enough's enough! I'm going to trust God for bigger and better things!' It's in such moments that your destiny is shaped. Think: the decisions you make today will affect not only you but future generations - so make sure they're the right ones!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When God approves of your life, even your enemies will end up shaking your hand.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:7 TM</span><br>You can't please everybody all the time. And it's a big mistake to try. Your constant need for approval can end up costing you God's best. When you're doing anything worthwhile, expect opposition from those who aren't in on God's plan for your life. That goes with the job. Notice, Jesus 'made himself of no reputation' (Philippians 2:7 KJV). He wasn't always well thought of by others, in fact a lot of people hated him, but He knew He had God's approval - and that's what mattered to Him! 
In Proverbs 21:1 Solomon says that just like changing the direction of a moving river, God can change hearts and give you favour with those who'd otherwise reject you. He also said, 'When God approves of your life, even your enemies will end up shaking your hand.' Does that mean you won't come across opposition or people who disagree with you? No, but when you do, just concentrate on pleasing God and let Him deal with the fallout.
Remember, God takes up where you leave off. When you've done &quot;all that you can do&quot; He can step in and open doors with the right people at just the right time. The truth is, He can get you a better opportunity than you could get on your own, and give you blessings that, humanly speaking, you don't deserve or qualify for. Just as the Holy Spirit enabled Jesus to fulfil His life's mission (see Luke 4:18-19), God will call, equip and enable you to fulfil His plan for YOUR life. So stop trying so hard to make things happen on your terms, and begin praying for God's favour!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 2:13 NAS</span><br>What makes you a spiritual adult? Knowing God; it's that simple! But this raises a question. How can you know that you know God intimately? It's like a good marriage: two people fall in love and become so close that each one knows what the other is thinking and feeling without a word being spoken. 
But such intimacy is not developed overnight. It's the product of time spent together and commitment to each other! Paul speaks about, 'Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not entered the heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love Him. For to us God revealed them through the Spirit' (1 Corinthians 2:9-10 NAS). The mature follower of Christ sees things the human eye can't see, hears things the most acute ear can't hear and has thoughts they didn't originate on their own. That's because God's indwelling Spirit is helping them to think God's thoughts. What an advantage! 
You'll know you are spiritually mature when God lets you pick up on thoughts and insights from His Word that go far beyond what someone told you, or what you heard in a sermon. That's because the Holy Spirit is now free to send His message clearly and directly to you. In other words we will 'know the things freely given to us by God' (1 Corinthians 2:12 NAS). But that means we have to be close enough to hear God speaking to us. Such intimacy doesn't just happen. It's not an afterthought. It must be your number one priority and the consuming passion of your life. Is it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 2:13 NAS</span><br>The second stage in spiritual growth is adolescence. John writes, 'Young men...you are strong, and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one' (1 John 2:14 NAS). The transition from adolescence into adulthood can be a bumpy ride. Teenagers clash with their parents and other authority figures because they're moving from dependence to independence. They wrestle with conflicting feelings of wanting their freedom, yet not really wanting it; especially if the parents are still paying the bills. They hate being told what time they have to 'be in', particularly when their friends don't have to worry about it. They don't like getting approval for clothes, parties, or for using the family car. They especially hate hearing, 'As long as you're under my roof you'll live by my rules. When you get your own family you can make up your own rules.' But like it or not, as teenagers we still need help, support and guidance.  
That's all true of the 'spiritual teenager' as well. They don't know as much as they think they know. They need guidance, support, and correction from more mature Christians so they can learn how to avoid falling into the enemy's trap. They need instruction and training in God's Word to make them strong and keep them ready at all times. And they need opportunities to serve, discover and develop their gifts, and gain experience. So, how can you tell when you've outgrown your spiritual adolescence and begun moving into adulthood? John answers, 'You are strong... the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 2:12 NAS </span><br>There are three stages to spiritual growth. The first is childhood. Have you got any little rugrats in your family?! If you have you'll know that there's one thing toddlers are good at; it's tripping and falling. Until they learn to walk confidently they need someone to pick them up, dry their tears, stick a plaster on their scraped knee, and reassure them that falling down doesn't mean they'll never be able walk like a grown up or that they're not part of the family. There are two things a spiritual toddler needs to understand: first, the difference between their stage of growth, and their spiritual position before God. Don't get these two things mixed up! Trusting in the finished work of Jesus (becoming a Christian) is the only thing that gives you right standing with God. From that moment on you are a fully accepted and rescued child of His. That's how He sees you. If you forget that you'll be in trouble, because every time you fall or mess up the Devil will try to make you doubt your salvation.
Think about this; suppose you're sitting in a maths lesson and you enter some wrong numbers into your calculator. What do you do? You have a little button called 'clear' which allows you to erase your error and start over. That's what the blood of Jesus does for you; it gives you a fresh start. Asking God to forgive you and deciding to live differently helps you to grow; we need to do it every day. The important thing to do whenever you trip up is to run quickly to Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>That I may...become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:10 AMP</span><br>When a storm hits, a tree needs roots that are strong and deep and when hard times hit us we need spiritual depth. Check out Job!  When the bottom dropped out of his world, Job said: 'But he knows where I am and what I've done. He can cross-examine me all he wants, and I'll pass the test - with honours... I've followed him closely, my feet in his footprints, not once swerving from his way... I've obeyed every word he's spoken, and not just obeyed his advice-I've treasured it' (Job 23:10-12 NAS). We need the spiritual depth of Paul, who prayed three times for what he calls 'the thorn in his flesh' to leave and three times the Lord said 'no' (although we don't know for sure what the thorn was, many think it was hardship and persecutions from others). In response, Paul said, '...these limitations that cut me down to size - abuse, accidents, opposition, bad breaks. I just let Christ take over! And so the weaker I get, the stronger I become' (2 Corinthians 12:9 TM). Instead of looking for a way out Paul declared, 'I chose to go through this so that I can have the privilege of experiencing more of Christ's power working in my life.' 
Don't you want what these people had, so that your spiritual life is such that you walk in step with God whether you feel good or not; whether you get a 'yes,' 'no,' or 'wait,' in answer to your prayers; even when you don't get your own way? Spiritual depth must become your all-consuming goal, and the highest priority of your life. Is it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Love...always hopes, always perseveres...never fails.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 13:6-8 NIV</span><br>When you meet someone who needs encouragement, give it to them! Why? Because more people die of broken hearts than swelled heads. And that's true, whether they live in a mansion or a mud hut. There is a cheesy story about a little boy who wanted to play darts with his father. He said, 'Come on, Dad, let's play darts. I'll throw and you shout &quot;amazing!&quot;' You may smile, but the truth is we tend to become what the most important people in our lives think of us. So whether it's friends or family think the best, believe the best, and express the best toward them;  for your words are helping to shape their destiny.
And remember, change happens by inches, not miles! The only way we can break old habits, old ways of thinking about ourselves, is to form new ones - and that takes time and practice - lots of it! You can't tell people something just once and expect them to get it. No, they need to hear it over and over before they start thinking differently about themselves. And how you tell them, the look in your eyes and the tone of your voice, can determine whether they really believe it. So think about it. Find creative ways of encouraging them; send a card, buy a trophy or medal and get it inscribed with a message, write a song or poem, carve a sculpture of them out of ice - well maybe not; but you get the idea. For most us actions speak louder than words. Be persistent! Never give up trying to big them up, encourage and help them. Remember, 'Love...always hopes, always perseveres... never fails.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The testing of your faith produces endurance.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:3 NAS</span><br>Endurance means 'sticking at it.' But endurance is only a word until you have to deal with a parent's divorce, a prolonged illness or the rebuilding of your life after a tragedy. Endurance is also a word which carries a lot of meaning when it comes to describing the preparation, practice and hard work that leads to success. It takes commitment to keep going when friends fail you, discouragement whispers 'give up,' and doubt says 'it can't be done.' That's when endurance takes on new meaning. It becomes your anchor in the storm, your compass in times of confusion, and the head of steam that gets you up the next hill. Remember, Jesus knows how it feels, and believe it or not, He is using those hard times to help us grow. Also He gives us two great promises: 
1) His comforting presence (see Isaiah 43:2-5) 
2) the assurance that He won't permit more pressure than we can handle (see 1 Corinthians 10:13).
But there's another thing to remember; other people are watching! Paul (with a bit of help from Eugene Petersen) writes, 'People are watching us as we stay at our post...working hard, working late, working without eating; with pure heart, clear head, steady hand; in gentleness, holiness and honest love; when we're telling the truth...when God's showing His power; when we're doing our best setting things right; when we're praised, and when we're blamed; slandered, and honoured; true to our word, though distrusted; ignored by the world, but recognised by God...immersed in tears yet always filled with deep joy; living on handouts, yet enriching many; having nothing, having it all' (1 Corinthians 6:1-10 TM). That's called 'Sticking at it.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOVE...IS NOT IRRITABLE OR TOUCHY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 13:4-5 TLB</span><br>The author, Chuck Swindoll writes 'The most significant decision I make each day is my choice of an attitude. When my attitudes are right there's no barrier too high, no valley too deep, no dream too extreme, no challenge too great for me.' If you believe that you'll take charge of your emotions, begin to focus on what's good, and reject anything that makes you a petty, bitter person. And your face will say 'Yes.'
One day President Thomas Jefferson and a group of friends were travelling across America on horseback. They came to a river that had overflowed its banks because of a recent downpour. The river had washed away the bridge so each rider was forced to cross it on horseback, fighting for his life against the current. This caused a traveller who was not part of the group to step aside and watch. After several riders had plunged in and made it to the other side, the stranger asked if President Jefferson would carry him across. The President agreed without hesitation. So the man climbed on and the two of them made it safely to the other side. As the stranger slid off the horse onto dry ground, one of Jefferson's mates asked, 'Why did you select the President?' The man was shocked and admitted he'd no idea that it was the President who'd helped him. 'All I know,' he said, 'is that on some of your faces was written the answer &quot;no,&quot; and on some was written the answer &quot;yes.&quot; His was a &quot;yes&quot; face.' A good attitude has a 'yes' face. Try to remember that today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>There is a way that seems right to a man, but...it leads to death.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 14:12 NIV</span><br>There is a broken rope on display at the Alpine Museum in Bern, Switzerland. It is associated with a tragic story. Some climbers who scaled the Matterhorn (a seriously dangerous mountain) roped themselves together for the return descent, but one slipped and dragged three others with him into an abyss. The other climbers braced for the shock on the rope that linked them together, expecting it to halt their companions' fall. The tug came, but then to everyone's horror the rope snapped, plunging their four friends to their death. Nobody knows why an inferior rope was used for such a hazardous venture, but they do know it wasn't genuine Alpine Club rope which was guaranteed and distinguished by a red strand running through it. 
Just as reliable equipment is crucial in preparing for the life-and-death adventure of mountain climbing, it is even more essential in preparing for the most important journey you'll ever make; the one from here to eternity. And an 'anything-goes' attitude; loose connections to the church; casual claims that you're doing your best and you're a 'good' person won't suffice. Solomon said, 'There is a way that seems right to a man, but...it leads to death.' 
Peter says: 'Jesus is the only One who can save' (Acts 4:12 NCV). Assurance of a place in God's kingdom, now and forever, comes only through accepting Jesus as your personal Saviour, believing that He died for your sins and rose again to give you everlasting life. God will not ask for any more or any less. Today Jesus is waiting to save you; will you let Him?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A miserable heart means a miserable life;   a cheerful heart fills the day with song..</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 15:15 TM</span><br>An old sea captain once asked a naval student how he'd handle a sudden storm. 'I'd throw out an anchor, sir,' he replied. 'But what if another storm approached?' asked the captain. 'Then I'd throw out another anchor,' he said. 'And what if storms just kept coming?' the old man asked. 'I'd keep throwing out anchors,' said the student. 'Hold on, son,' said the captain, 'where are you getting all those anchors?' 'From the same place you keep getting all those storms, sir,' came the reply! 
When you're in the thick of things, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the storm that's raging inside you and start listening to the 'what ifs.' What if they dump me...what If I don't get on the course...what if mum and dad split...what If that relative doesn't get better. The list is endless. And because satan knows that 'fear involves torment'   (1 John 4:18 NKJV), he'll keep pouring it on. If he can't get you puffed up through pride he'll try to bring you down through fear. It's one of his most effective weapons. But you don't have to take it! Paul says, 'Leave no room...for the devil [give no opportunity to him]' (Ephesians 4:27 AMP). Jesus told us not to be 'fearful...intimidated...and unsettled' (John 14:27 AMP). Remember 'A miserable heart means a miserable life; a cheerful heart fills the day with song'. Here's the bottom line: God is '...completely dependable. If He said it, He'll do it! (1 Thessalonians 5:24 TM). So, no matter how big your problem is today, keep trusting God and He will bring you through!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Fear of man is a dangerous trap.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 29:25 TLB</span><br>Sometimes we are so desperate to make a relationship happen we will pay a costly price. Teen movies are packed with parables like the geeky kid who has to get a make over to win the school's approval or the best friend who never says no and gets pushed around, manipulated and taking for granted. The moral of the tale is: can we ever be happy always trying to make other people happy? 
Solomon said, 'Fear of man is a dangerous trap.' Relationships can't thrive with one person calling all the shots while the other struggles for approval.
Paul said he had no interest in 'trying to make people accept him.' His only interest was pleasing God (see Galatians 1:10 NCV). God will never ask you to compromise your values or disobey His will just to be in the good graces of another person. In fact, it's better to be alone than to allow anyone other than God to control you. Let people know up front that, while you'd like their approval, you can live without it if you have to. Respect others, and make it clear you expect the same in return. 
Above all, never let your emotions win out over wisdom, or drown out the voice of God in your life. When you're insecure you can be drawn into wrong relationships. Security is a fundamental part of your identity as God's child. Paul says you 'are God's workmanship...created...in Christ Jesus' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV). God wants you free to be who you are. That's why when you ask Him to guide your relationships; He'll help you to form the right ones.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Revelation 2:5 NAS</span><br>Many teenagers have perfected a silent groan and sarcastic roll of the eyes the moment they ever hear an adult say 'I remember when...'. In their minds the past is well ... past it! It's old news, it's out of date, it's boring. What's the point in looking back when we should be looking at forward! Maybe mobile phones, game consoles and ipods ALWAYS keep improving as time goes on; but do we? Often our walk with God isn't what it used to be, sometimes we need to look back and remember.
In the book of Revelation, Jesus has a message for a bunch of Christians in a city called Ephesus, but is He speaking to all of us? 'Remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first.' Go back in your mind to your first days as a Christian. Do you remember when  a) you talked about Jesus and your heart would be buzzing  b) prayer was exciting and you felt empowered as you spent time with Him  c) the Bible was filled with mind blowing insights and ideas you'd never seen before  d) you were desperate for people to find out about how amazing God was? What happened? Do you feel like one of the Christians Jesus was speaking to?
Distance from God is a frightening thing because you don't even know it's happening! We need to get back into step with Him. When we try to fit God in instead of putting Him first, we are going to lose touch. This week what could you start doing again that 'you did at first'?

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Live generously and graciously toward others, the way God lives toward you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:48 TM</span><br>About 5 years ago Danny Wallace put a advert in a local newspaper which simply said 'Join Me'. He asked anyone who wanted to join him to send a passport photo and that was it! Danny didn't expect to anyone to reply, especially since the advert said nothing about what or why they were joining or even what 'joining' really meant. Amazingly, in few weeks 4000 people sent him photos and became 'joinees.' After a while the joinees were emailing their new 'leader' to ask what they had joined; what did their group do? Danny didn't know, he'd just done it for a bit of a laugh. Then he had an idea, tell them to live generously. Every Friday everyone had to perform a random act of kindness towards a stranger. Shopping was being carried, cuppas being paid for, flowers were taken to old people's homes, and cakes were left on doorsteps. Of course it's not just Danny's mates, across the world a lot of people are kind and make a difference everyday. 
Jesus told HIS joinees to live generously but He also went further than that. He said live the way that God lives towards you.'  Lets think about that! That's means not just being kind to strangers, the needy or deserving, but being kind to the undeserving, the cruel, the selfish. It means generosity that's driven by grace. It means loving our enemies! After all this is how God lives towards you. 'While we were God's enemies, He made us His friends' (Romans 5:10 NCV) Jesus has shown how to love, how to serve, how to live, how to be kind; now He says 'Join me'.   It's up to you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GROW UP. YOU'RE KINGDOM SUBJECTS. NOW LIVE LIKE IT. LIVE OUT YOUR GOD-CREATED IDENTITY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5: 48 TM</span><br>Bono from U2 once said: 'I decided to act like a rockstar and suddenly I had become a rockstar.' But what did people think of the young Paul Hewson (Bono's real name) when he was walking around in his now famous sun glasses and 'acting' like a rockstar? Maybe they thought he was just a dreamer, but did he care? He'd made a decision, he was going to live like the person God had designed him to be. What have you decided to live like? Jesus is telling his followers to 'live out your God-created identity'. Yet so often we're busy wanting to be like other people. We see their gifts, their looks, their opportunities and find ourselves asking God to change us and make us more like them. God does want to change us, but He won't change you into someone else, He will only change you into the person He created you to be. 
Part of being that person is to live like a 'kingdom subject'; to live like a child of God. 'Act your age and not your shoe size' is a saying that comes straight out of the mum's manual of 'How to Wind Up Your Kids.'  But lets be honest, 8 of 10 times your mum often has a point. Sometimes we do need to grow up. Jesus says 'Grow up. You're kingdom subjects. Now live like it'. He knows what we are capable of, what our potential is and hates to see us compromise, settle for second best or fall short. When we call ourselves Christians, it means we represent Jesus. So today decide to represent Jesus by being the person He has created you to be.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Christ...is your example. Follow in his steps.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 2:21 TLB</span><br>Richard Halverson, an American author, writes, 'Do you want to be a winner? Compete against yourself, not somebody else. Outrunning your rival doesn't mean you ran your best race. You can win over another and still not fulfil your potential. To be your best you must compete with yourself; Alexander the Great conquered the world, yet cursed his own lack of self-control. Victory over others may in fact be the very thing that contributes to the winner's failure to conquer self. Winning makes him arrogant, independent, thoughtless; and sometimes cruel.  The one who stops maturing spiritually because he thinks he knows more scripture than others, or has more success in ministry, is still far from being what Christ has planned for him.'
Wow, read that again and let it sink in! Sometimes it's easy for us to think we are more sorted because we might be doing better than someone else. We might be doing better but are we doing our best? Oh and if you're going to start comparing, compare yourself with the top dog himself! 'Christ...is your example. Follow in His steps: He never sinned, never told a lie, never answered back when insulted; when He suffered He did not threaten to get even; He left His case in the hands of God who always judges fairly' (1 Peter 2:21-23 TLB). Go ahead, measure yourself by that standard! And when you see how far short you fall, get down on your knees and ask God to mould and fashion your life into the full potential, the divine original He intended. Do that and you win the biggest battle of all!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...AFTER YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING...STAND</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:13 NIV</span><br>Since we've all got long lists of weaknesses, what do we do when the enemy comes along? Check this out, 'after you have done everything... stand'. In Romans 14:4 Paul says, '...the Lord is able to make [you] stand' (NIV). You don't have to stand in your own strength, you can stand in the strength of Jesus. By yourself you're an easy target for the enemy, but in the strength of the Lord you can stand and not give in. 
So today when satan shows up with his temptations, announce that you're going to stand in Jesus. Make a decision that you're going to stand until the ground stops shaking, until you feel peace again, until the wave of loneliness passes, until your friendship is restored, until the illness is passed, until the struggle is over, and until the tempter runs out of steam and stops trying to topple you!
When you do the standing - God does the strengthening! Paul said, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me' (Philippians 4:13 NKJ). Jesus doesn't just strengthen you once or twice or three times; He'll strengthen you every single time. Every time you face a difficult challenge, every time a memory comes back to haunt you, every time you're reminded of your imperfect past, every time you face a difficult decision. Drawing from God the strength you need to stand up to the enemy will take effort. It will take your praise, your prayer, and your getting into the Bible with an intensity you've never had before. But the fact is Jesus is with you and you can stand - if you really want to!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CREATE IN ME A PURE HEART, O GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:10 NIV</span><br>What's purity? The 'P' word may evoke loads of different thoughts in your mind - it might make you think of something different from the kind of person you are. You may think that it's something you long to be, but you feel dirty from all the stuff you've done in your life, so it's totally out of your reach. You know what? In a way all those thoughts have an element of truth to them. You can't make yourself pure by how often you pray or go to church. You can't even make yourself pure by giving yourself a scrub in a bubble bath! Something is pure if it has no contamination and you can only be made pure by Jesus. Only He has the power to turn your mistakes round for good, mend your broken heart and clothe you with pure... purity!  
Someone who is contaminated has no way of becoming pure by their own efforts. But, if you have said 'Yes' to Jesus as your Lord and Saviour you can trust that today you stand '...Holy and blameless in His sight...' (Ephesians 1:4 NIV). He has made you pure. You may be thinking, 'that's all good but how am I supposed to live a life that matches up with how God sees me?'  Well God gives us some amazing advice through the words of King David, 'How can a young person live a clean life? By carefully reading the map of your Word...' (Psalm 119:9 TM). God's word is like a map of a city - it shows us the right roads to go down and where there is a dead end. Navigate your day with His word!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD...DOES NOT TEMPT ANYONE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:13 NAS </span><br>Trials and temptations are very different. Trials are allowed by God to form character in us. Temptations are sent by satan simply to bring us down. There's no way a temptation to sin can be called a trial sent from God. He doesn't test our faith by setting us up to sin. Just because it's so easy to click on a porno website doesn't mean it must be okay with God if you do! Just because your teacher can never tell if you're lying doesn't mean you should! Get real! James wrote: 'Let no one say when he is tempted, &quot;I am being tempted by God&quot;...each one is tempted when he is...enticed...' (v13-14). The word 'entice' describes a fisherman putting bait on a hook to get a fish to bite. The fish is looking for a snack, not to become dinner for the fisherman. No mouse goes looking for a mousetrap. What the mouse wants is the cheese. But its appetite for cheese cons it into thinking that the cheese is a free meal, and the trap is sprung. Eating well nourishes your body; but too much bad food produces all sorts of health problems. Money can really bless you; but spending irresponsibly can trap you in a spiral of debt. When a desire for something becomes all consuming, hear the warning bell ringing!
But the Good News is you're not in this fight alone. Peter writes: '...the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials...' (2 Peter 2:9 NLT). Victory comes when you draw closer to the One who defeated the tempter both in life and in death. So call on Him today. He's ready to help you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...SOMEHOW OR OTHER YOU WERE INFLUENCED AND LED ASTRAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 12:2 NIV </span><br>The Oxford dictionary defines 'influence' as: 'the power or ability to affect someone's beliefs or actions'. So, are you an influence or are you influenced? One of the biggest influences on us is the culture around us. There's Music Culture - Hip Hop with its bikinis and bling, Metal with its Marshall Amps and hair dye. The latest overnight success interviewed in NME or on MTV as if the world needed another Pop Idol! There's Tech Culture; the latest and most funky software and gadgets; Shopping online and never doing anything old-fashioned like picking up a pen - why write when you can type! 
We live in a media driven culture that's very fast paced and we hear a lot of things during our day from news clips, celebrities, advertising and politicians to name a few. But in all of what we hear we have a choice to let it influence us or not. Remember that dictionary definition? 'the power or ability to affect someone's beliefs or actions'. God wants us to make sure that the power is flowing in the right direction - His power through us to the world - not the other way round. As Christians, the culture that should influence us the most should be the culture of God's Kingdom. What's that? Kingdom culture is God's values being lived out daily, like loving your neighbours as yourself (see Luke 10:27) and being kind to people even when they're not kind to you (see Matthew 5:44). You see God's way of doing things isn't the same as the world's way, but it has the best results. Today, make sure you are an influencer not one of the influenced.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT IS BEST TO LISTEN MUCH, SPEAK LITTLE, AND NOT BECOME ANGRY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:19 TLB</span><br>Famous psychologist Abraham Maslow said, 'If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.'  What he means is that some of us have strong personalities and always take the hammer approach when something gentler will do. If that's your problem, try using the following T's : 
1) Total picture. A man walked into a bar, 'Do you have anything to cure hiccups?' he asked. The bartender slapped him across the face. 'Oi! what's that for?' said the man. The bartender smiled 'Well, you don't have hiccups any more, do you?' 'I never did' the man replied. 'I wanted something to cure my wife, she's outside in the car.'  Do you come to conclusions before you actually have a proper grasp of the issue? Chill out for a mo' and think; then you'll be more likely to get the total picture.
2) Timing. If the parent doesn't get the injured child to the hospital quickly enough, her life might be lost; and if you don't apologise when you've wronged someone, the relationship could be lost. When you act, is as important as taking the right action. Also knowing when not to act. Lady Dorothy Nevill observed: 'The art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place, but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.'
3) Temperature. As tempers flare, we drop more bombs instead of calling a ceasefire. Here's a tip: a) if the reaction is worse than the action, the problem usually increases b) if the reaction is less than the action, the problem usually decreases. So, don't take the hammer approach!

<title><![CDATA[Easily hurt?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT DOES WONDERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 12:25 TLB</span><br>Ask yourself, 'Do I hurt people, or am I easily hurt by them?' Then consider these truths:   
1) Hurting people hurt other people. The German poet Herman Hesse wrote: 'If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.' Hurting people lash out in response to what's happening inside them. They feel or believe something negative within themselves. Try to remember that.   
2) Hurting people are more easily hurt again. Let's say you've got a splinter in your finger and it becomes infected. Then someone brushes against it. You howl with pain, 'Aaaah! You hurt me!' But the real problem is not that someone accidentally touched it - the problem is you still have a splinter and you've not dealt with it! Hurting people overreact, overexaggerate, and overprotect. Ask any counsellor who's dealt with a hurting couple. Emotionally speaking one half 'throws up' then the other half 'cleans up.' Usually the one with the most pain does the most damage.   
3) Quick fixes don't work. The kindest thing you can do for hurting people is ask them, 'Are you prepared to work through the issues and get beyond your pain?' When a drainage company was working under the streets cleaning out a sewer they found: sixty-one diamond rings, several vintage coins and a whole load of silverware! It was an unpleasant job - but they discovered all sorts of valuables in the process! Now, in the same way you may need to do some digging and deal with some pretty nasty stuff, but you're going to discover some treasures you didn't know existed.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A WOMAN IN THE CROWD HAD SUFFERED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 5:25 NLT</span><br>Mark records, 'a woman in the crowd had suffered for 12 years with constant bleeding.'  She was desperate. But her desperation gave birth to an idea - 'She had heard about Jesus...' (v27 NLT). And Jesus was in town! He was there on a mercy mission, on his way to help the synagogue leader. It's a bit odd to find the ruler and the woman in the same story. He's powerful. She's pitiful. But they both need Jesus. His daughter is dying. Tragedy has a way of levelling the social ladder. 
She thought, '&quot;...If I can just touch His robe, I will be healed&quot;' (v28 NLT). So she pushed through the crowd until Jesus' robe was in sight. She stretched out her hand. 'Immediately...she could feel...that she had been healed...' (v29 NLT). She felt power enter. Jesus felt power exit. 'Jesus...asked, &quot;Who touched my robe?&quot; (v30 NLT). Next we read: '...The woman...knowing she was the one...knelt before him, and gave him the whole story' (Mark 5:33 TM). Wow! How long had it been since someone listened to her story? With the priest waiting, a child dying and a crowd pressing, Jesus made time for a woman on the fringe. Using special intimate language He says, '&quot;...Daughter, your faith has made you well...&quot;' (v34 NLT). And we've been her, haven't we? Illness took her strength. What took yours? Harsh words? Bad advice? Disappointments? Controlling relationships? Is her hand your hand? Jesus is there for you even when it's hectic all around. He wants to hear your story. You can receive the power you need today. Even the emergencies can wait until you are restored! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 4:16 NAS</span><br>What does God's grace remind you of? Have you ever thought about it like an ambulance racing to treat someone in an emergency? The crew of paramedics offer assistance to the victim on the spot. First, they give immediate grace to the most serious symptoms or injuries. Then they move into the ambulance, which is equipped with more grace - more medical facilities - to deal with the problem. And as the paramedics are administering more grace to the patient, the ambulance races to the hospital where even more grace is waiting. Once the patient is admitted, the hospital keeps dispensing grace to meet the need until the problem has been addressed and the patient can go home again! As the old hymn goes: 'Twas Grace that brought me safe thus far, and Grace will lead me home.'
Imagine Jesus as that paramedic. He came to you, found you dying in your sin and started the job of pouring grace on your wounds. And, a bit like the driver of the ambulance, He also transported you from where you were, to a place that has all the grace you will ever need as long as you live, until you are finally and fully restored at the resurrection to reign with Him forever. 
So, how can we be on the receiving end of grace like this and take the time to thank Him? 'But I'm tired' you say. That's ok, just whisper. 'But you don't understand. I'm hurting and I feel like quitting.' Jesus understands, just tell Him. Today He'll meet you where you are and bring to you all the grace you need!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...the Holy Spirit...will teach you all things...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:26 NIV</span><br>Did you know that when you said yes to following Jesus you weren't left on your own to try and figure everything out for your self, no way! God gives all His children an amazing gift, His Holy Spirit. Listen: 'But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you' (John 14:26 NIV). The Holy Spirit is there to help us get to know God better and to have a close friendship with Him. You might be saying to yourself, 'how do I receive this gift?' The same way you receive any present, all you have to do is accept it, and then say thanks. Wow, now you have a really special super-close friend for life. The Holy Spirit is God's Spirit so He will never lie to you, always love you and to top it off is really good at giving direction and advice. 
But hold on, it doesn't stop there! When you said yes to following Jesus you joined an amazing team. God's Church is made up of all sorts of people with loads of gifting and talents and all with one purpose. What? To see Jesus' name made famous in the world and to see the whole planet transformed by the power of His love! Paul describes God's master plan like this in his letter to the Christians in Ephesus, 'God's purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety...' (Ephesians 3:10 NLT). Today you're part of that great display, part of that rich variety. That's so cool!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IN HIS LARGENESS NOTHING GETS LOST...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 36:5 TM</span><br>Have you ever stopped to think about how massive God actually is? Well today we're going to do just that. Listen: '&quot;I am...the [beginning] and the [ending]&quot;' (Revelation 1:8 NIV) that's one of the ways in which God describes himself! He's the one who created the whole universe, flung the stars into space, spoke and created...well, everything! He's so massive that no human brain will never really be able to 'get it'. So here's something that should blow your mind for the rest of today - or maybe the rest of your life; even though He is the awesome, massive, all powerful, all knowing God, His strongest desire is to have a relationship with YOU!!! Check this out: 'God's love is meteoric, His loyalty astronomic, His purpose titanic (not the ship, 'titanic' means BIG), His verdicts oceanic. Yet in His largeness nothing gets lost...' (Psalm 36:5 TM). God may be the creator of the mountains and the stars and the big blue sky, but he is also the one who thought up butterflies, the snowflake and chocolate, yes He invented the cocoa bean! Why should that matter? Well doesn't that show you a glimpse of God's heart? His attention to the details not only in how He creates but in the way He relates to His children. '...in His largeness nothing gets lost...' You have the attention of the creator of the universe and everything in it and He loves you enough to want to talk to you, help you, heal you and be your best friend. Don't you think that's truly mind-blowing stuff!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...CHOOSE...TODAY WHOM YOU WILL SERVE...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 24:15 NCV</span><br>Peer pressure is a powerful thing. You want to be liked by people but at the same time you don't want to say yes to things that you know are going to have a bad ending. For example, if someone offers you a cigarette you are immediately faced with two choices. 1) You say yes to one, then that leads to another and then before you know it you're hooked and smelling like an ashtray. 
2) You say no and have lungs that will last you a life time! You see God has given us the ability to make choices and to be able to know what is wrong from what is right; but often we try to place the blame of our bad choices on someone else. 'They made me do it.' Isn't an excuse you can use with God. Why? Because God has given us all free will and that means the ability to say No to peer pressure. 
When you say yes to something you are saying, 'I give you the right to have some form of control in my life.'  That might sound like a bit of an overstatement but think about it, you'll find it's true every time. So be careful what you agree to. There's never a situation where you can say 'But I had no choice.' You always have options and alternatives. When the choice is there you'll know deep down in your heart what the right decision is, you just need to ask God for the courage to choose it, no matter what your mates might think of you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;DO NOT DESPISE THESE SMALL BEGINNINGS, FOR THE LORD REJOICES TO SEE THE WORK BEGIN...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ZECHARIAH 4:10 NLT</span><br>What seems small to you might be huge to someone else. During one World War II mission an RAF pilot came under attack from Nazi anti-aircraft guns. These guns were deadly because they could fire very rapidly, they had a long range and worst of all, they fired 75mm artillery shells that would explode on impact. Amazingly, even though his fuel tank was hit the plane didn't explode, and the pilot was able to make a bumpy landing. After the raid the pilot asked one of the crew to try to locate the German shell, so he could keep it as a souvenir. After investigating the crew member came back to him saying that not just one, but eleven artillery shells had been found in the fuel tank, none of which had gone off! They were all clean and harmless, and with one exception, empty. The exception contained a carefully rolled piece of paper. On it a message had been scrawled in the Czech language: 'This is all we can do for you now.' A brave worker forced to work on an ammunition assembly line had disarmed the shells so they wouldn't go off and had scribbled that note. He couldn't stop the war, but he could save one plane. He couldn't do much, but he could do something, and he did. 
Famous preacher John Wesley said, 'Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as you ever can.' With God, small deeds count!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOVE NEVER FAILS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 13:8 NIV</span><br>Author Richard Selzer writes: 'I stand by the bed where a young woman lays, her face post-operative, her mouth twisted in palsy; clownish. A tiny twig of the facial nerve, the one to the muscles of her mouth, has been severed. The surgeon had followed with religious fervour the curve of her flesh; I promise you that. Nonetheless, to remove the tumour from her cheek I had to cut the little nerve. Her young husband is in the room. He stands on the opposite side of the bed, and together they seem to dwell in the evening lamplight, isolated from me, private. Who are they, I ask myself, he and this wry-mouth I have made, who gaze at and touch each other so generously, greedily? &quot;Will my mouth always be like this?&quot; she asks. &quot;Yes,&quot; I say, &quot;it will be. It is because the nerve was cut.&quot; She nods and is silent. But the young man smiles. &quot;I like it,&quot; he says, &quot;it's kind of cute.&quot; All at once I know who he is. I understand, and I lower my gaze. One is not old in an encounter with God. Unmindful, he bends to kiss her crooked mouth, and I am so close I can see how he twists his own lips to accommodate her, and to show her that their kiss still works.'
When trouble comes and hurts the people you love; do you stand by them to the end or do you run and hide to try and protect yourself? The Apostle Paul talks about love, Listen, 'It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres' (1 Corinthians 13:7 NIV). That's real love!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;COME, FOLLOW ME...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 4:19 NIV</span><br>The word 'disciple' means being an apprentice to someone. And back in the day it was easy to tell if someone had done that. Peter, James and John made a decision to spend every day with Jesus in order to learn how to be like Him. They did the same kinds of things you do; ate, slept, worked, had a laugh, and learnt loads too. They just did all of these things with Jesus. And now it's your turn. What happened to those three fishermen 2000 years ago can happen for you. What you're doing now, your personality type - these are not obstacles. Throughout history when people came to understand what Jesus was really about they would give up anything - money, comfort, home, security - to get the chance to be taught by Him. And now it's your chance too! 
Check out these words from Dr. Bob Moorehead's book, Words Aptly Spoken: 'The die has been cast. I have stepped over the line. The decision has been made - I'm a disciple of His. I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still. My past is redeemed, my present makes sense, and my future is secure. I'm finished with low living, sight walking, smooth knees, colourless dreams, tamed visions, worldly talking, cheap giving, and dwarfed goals. I no longer need preeminence, position, promotions, plaudits, or popularity. I don't have to be right, first, tops, recognised, praised, regarded, or rewarded. I now live by faith, depend on His presence, walk by patience, am uplifted by prayer, and labour with power.' That's what it means to be a follower of Jesus!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU ARE THE ONE WHO PUT ME TOGETHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 139:13 CEV</span><br>There are some things in life that are so basic we don't even need to learn them - we just know naturally that they are good things that make sense. For instance, when a baby starts to cry because she's hungry, her mother will pick her up, hold her in her arms and feed her. By doing this the baby is not only being fed the food she needs to keep her body healthy, she is also receiving the love. But check this out: some years ago, studies were done to try and figure out why babies in orphanages, who were being regularly fed, were still dying. It was discovered that they were dying because they weren't being held or cuddled because the attendants were too busy to give them the individual attention they needed. These babies were dying from lack of relationship and love! 
Even when you've grown up you're still designed to have a relationship with your parents that has the basic elements of love, comfort and security. If you don't have that it can effect your emotions and your future relationships. That's why it is so important that, in your relationship with God, you let Him love you because what you may be missing out on He wants to give you. Have you ever heard of couples falling in love over the Internet before they met face to face?  It happens a lot. If two people who've never seen each other can fall deeply in love just through writing to each other, how much more should you be able to develop a deep relationship with Jesus? Think about it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TRUST GOD FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART; AND DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:5 TM</span><br>'What if?' is a question we have all asked ourselves millions of times. 'What if I don't pass my exams? What if I don't get into the university I want to go to?' 'What if they stop fancying me and I end up alone?' There's not a problem with asking questions about life and the world around you. In fact lots of people in the Bible even asked God questions - sometimes really hard questions. The issue is what's behind the question. Is your 'What if' question asked out of fear, doubt or worry rather than trust? 
What does it mean to trust? The dictionary says it's, 'To place somebody or something in the care of another person.' Wow, that is a tough challenge for some of us; especially if you've trusted someone in the past and they let you down. But with God things are different, 'God....will not lie...He does not change his mind...what He says He will do, He does. What He promises, He makes come true' (Numbers 23:19 NCV). When we decide to trust God with our future and the decisions we're literally saying to Him 'God I am placing my life into Your care and I am choosing to trust that what ever challenges I face or decisions I have to make You will be watching over me and helping me to do what is best for the exciting life You want me to lead.' Trusting God takes the massive weight of trying to figure everything out ourselves off our shoulders! So today when you start to think 'what if?' stop yourself and make a choice to trust.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HASTE MAKES MISTAKES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 19:2 NLT</span><br>Author, John Ortberg writes: 'When I first moved to Chicago I called a friend - the wisest spiritual man I know - and asked him, &quot;What do I need to do to be healthy spiritually?&quot; He said, &quot;You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life.&quot; There was a long pause, and I finally said, &quot;Okay.&quot; I wrote that one down. &quot;Now, what else do you have to tell me, because I don't have much time and I want to get a lot of wisdom out of this conversation?&quot; He replied &quot;There is nothing else. Hurry is the great enemy of spiritual life. You can hardly do anything that Jesus did if you're in a hurry. Jesus was often busy, but never hurried. Hurry is an inward condition that can make you feel frantic and preoccupied that you're unable to receive love from the Father, unable to be present with other people, or to give love to them.&quot;'
Have you ever said this to yourself: 'I'm just going through a busy spell, things will just settle down in time' No they won't!  Life will always be hectic until you decide to get it under control. And if you're always waiting for stuff to chill out before you obey God, you'll never do what God has planned for you! The key is to cut out hurry. No one can do that for you - not your mum, dad, brother, sister, or your best mate. You have to do it yourself. To help you do that here's two verses for you to think about today: 
1) 'Be still, and know that I am God...' (Psalm 46:10 NIV). 
2) 'Enthusiasm without knowledge is no good; haste makes mistakes' (Proverbs 19:2 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I SAID, &quot;I WILL CONFESS MY TRANSGRESSIONS TO THE LORD&quot; - AND YOU FORGAVE THE GUILT OF MY SIN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 32:5 NIV</span><br>People who keep secrets from God also keep their distance from God. But people who are honest with God find themselves getting closer to Him every day. When you talk to God how honest are you with Him? Do you just tell Him what you think He wants to hear? Do you use words and phrases that you've hear 'holy people' use in prayer meetings? Or do you talk honestly, from the depths of your heart about what's really going on in your life, warts and all? If you read Psalms you'll notice that a load of them are written by King David, they're poems and songs that are directed at God and they are brutally honest about how he feels, a mixture of passionate love and painful frustration for God and his people, '&quot;...Have Mercy on me oh God...&quot;' (Psalm 51:1), 'How priceless is your unfailing love!' (Psalm 36:7), 'But I call to God, and the Lord saves me' (Psalm 55:16). David made mistakes like any normal human being but he was honest with God, he didn't try and hide his mistakes. He tells God and knows that He won't be met with a big stick but with gentleness and forgiveness. 'People may be right in their own eyes, but the Lord examines their heart' (Proverbs 21:2 NLT). God can see into every person's heart and knows all their secrets so it's pointless to try and hide when you talk to God, there's nothing you can tell Him that will shock Him. There's nothing you can say that will make Him love you any less. So be honest, you've got nothing to loose.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T FOOL YOURSELF, BAD FRIENDS WILL DESTROY YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 15:33 CEV</span><br>Have you noticed that if you spend time with a person who is really fun and laughs a lot you find yourself laughing more and seeing the funny side to things too? Just like if you spend time with a person who is always backstabbing and being nasty about people behind their backs you may begin to realise that you're starting to do it too. The relationships you make and the people you hang out with will influence you in the end. Anyone can become so caught up in the wrong crowd and in bad company it's that easy to make choices we never would have made on our own. That's why it's important that you choose your mates carefully. It's also why you need to make your relationship with God your number one priority. 
When you spend time hanging out with God, talking to Him and listening to what He has to say it will have an amazing effect on your life. How? Well let's take one part of God's character, Love. God is Love ...He can't stop Himself from loving you. If you hang out with the one who knows how to love people perfectly then that love will start to rub off on you. You'll find yourself going out of your way to smile at people you used to ignore. You'll find yourself having patience with people who normally do your head in. The fact is the relationship you have with God directly affects your relationships with other people? So make God your number one priority today - make sure you spend quality time with Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[MY] LIFE IS WORTH NOTHING UNLESS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 20:24 TLB</span><br>It's said that in Mount Hope Cemetery, you'll find several strange gravestones. Farmer John Davis had them erected. He began his working life as a hired labourer but eventually managed to gain a considerable fortune. In the process he didn't make many friends. Angry with how his life had turned out he vowed not to leave anyone a penny. When his wife died Davis erected an elaborate statue which showed both her and him at opposite ends of a sofa. He was so pleased with this that he planned a second monument, with his wife kneeling at his future graveside placing a wreath. Then he had a sculptor place a pair of wings on her back. One idea led to another until he'd spent a quarter of a million dollars on monuments to his wife and himself. Whenever someone from his town asked him to contribute to something charitable like a new hospital ward the old man would say, 'What's this town ever done for me?' After using up all his money on statues, Davis died at 92, lonely, miserable, and flat broke. His monuments...it's strange...each one is slowly sinking into the Kansas soil, fast becoming victims of time, vandalism and neglect. There's a certain poetic justice in the fact that within a few years they'll all be gone. Oh, by the way, only one person attended Farmer Davis' funeral: Horace England, the salesman from the tombstone company. What a way to go! But not Paul: '[My] life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus.' Can you say that?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...SEE THAT YOU ALSO EXCEL IN THIS GRACE OF GIVING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 8:7 NIV</span><br>As a Christian the reason you do anything good is because Jesus saved your life and gave you a brand new one. Paul writes: '...Jesus Christ...Rich as he was...gave it all away for us - in one stroke he became poor and we became rich' (2 Corinthians 8:9 TM). God gave us His best in Jesus, but we still give Him our sloppy seconds.  Instead of going out of our way for someone, we make excuses and fit them in when it suits us. Or we say we're gonna spend time with God but get so busy we just rant at him for a few minutes while trying to brush our hair / make toast / run to the bus stop, instead of really making time to talk. 
Have you ever been given a present you hate, so you put it in a drawer for a while and then pulled it out as a present for someone else's birthday? Be honest! Well, that's how some of us approach giving to God - and to be honest its not just cheeky and rude - it's plain disrespectful! God made everything to give: He created the sun to give light during the day and the moon and stars during the night. He created flowers to give seeds. God Himself is a giver: 'For God so loved the world that he gave...' (John 3:16 KJV). Your giving is not determined by your how much money you've got in the bank, or how much free time you can fit into your week. No, you give coz God has already given so much to you and you love to make Him smile!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...SEE THAT YOU ALSO EXCEL IN THIS GRACE OF GIVING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 8:7 NIV</span><br>God loves a happy giver, whether it's giving your time, giving your money or giving your dedication to something; it all puts a smile on God's face. The apostle Paul talks about a bunch of people who gave generously in loads of ways even though things were tough. Listen to this: '...I want to report on the surprising and generous ways in which God is working in the churches in Macedonia province. Fierce troubles came down on the people in those churches, pushing them to the very limit. The trial exposed their true colours: They were incredibly happy, though desperately poor. The pressure triggered something totally unexpected: an outpouring of...generous gifts...They gave offerings of whatever they could - far more than they could afford! - pleading for the privilege of helping...This was totally spontaneous, entirely their own idea, and caught us completely off guard. What explains it was that they had first given themselves unreservedly to God and to us. The other giving simply flowed out of the purposes of God working in their lives' (2 Corinthians 8:1-6 TM). 
Check this out about givers from Macedonia: 
1) They gave their lives to Jesus, with no strings attached.  
2) They understood that everything they possessed was given them by God in the first place. 
This kind of giving isn't just giving because somebody is begging, or giving because you feel guilty, or giving because you're trying to do a deal with God. No, this is giving out of the massive blessings God has already given to you. You might not have much money, but with God you're rich in loads of other ways. So share it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WHO RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD WILL...GIVE LIFE TO YOUR MORTAL BODIES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:11 NIV</span><br>Years ago a missionary in Brazil discovered a tribe of Indians living in a remote jungle area. Disease was ravaging their population and they urgently needed medical help. However, the only clinic was on the other side of a raging river the Indians believed was inhabited by evil spirits. In their minds, crossing the river meant certain death. Although the missionary assured them he'd crossed it safely many times, they were still scared stiff. When he led them to the bank and placed his hand in the water, they looked concerned. Then He even waded in and splashed water on his face - they started to get really panicky. Finally he dived into the water and swam under the surface, emerging safely on the other side. Having proved that the river had no special powers the missionary raised a triumphant fist. The tribe broke into cheers and all followed him across. 
Today is when we celebrate Jesus diving into the river of death. He defeated it by submerging, crossing over and rising again on the other side! Dr Erwin Lutzer said. 'We don't need a Saviour who can just &quot;help&quot; us; we need [one] who can resurrect us. We don't need a Saviour who helps us when life gets tough; we need [one] who can help us when life ends.'  Easter proves Jesus is '&quot;...the resurrection, and the life...&quot;' (John 11:25 NCV).  Jesus kicked the ends out of the grave, transforming it from a dead-end street into a highway from here to heaven! And Paul says, '...He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit...' No wonder we say 'Happy Easter!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;BUT WHO EVER LISTENS TO ME WILL LIVE IN SAFETY AND BE AT EASE, WITHOUT FEAR OF HARM&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 1:33 NIV</span><br>Have you ever done a test or exam and spent so long over one question that you end up rushing all the rest when you realize you've only got 10 minutes left! It's lethal isn't it because you just start scribbling an answer before you suddenly realize 'Pants! I've totally misunderstood the question!  In the same way why do we try and guess what we think God might have to say in answer to a question we have rather than actually spending the time in His presence listening to what He says is the best way. This is just daft coz God's way is always the best way and it's important to ask His opinion on stuff. Why? He sees the whole picture and he knows what sneaky trick the enemy could have ready to try and make you trip up. He wants to protect you from that. 
King David learnt a big lesson when he was leading Israel. They were at war and David went to talk to the Lord about what they should do to win. God, told him and they won a great victory. When it came to the next fight David made a mistake and he didn't go and get God's tactics; he assumed that if they did it the same way as before they'd win again, but they got battered instead. Because they'd done it that way before their enemies we're ready for them. It's the same in our lives, we shouldn't try and guess the answer but go to the one who is the answer, and it will save you a lot of heart ache and trouble in the end.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IN HOPE THAT THE CREATION ITSELF WILL BE LIBERATED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:20-21 NIV</span><br>What would this day have been like for the disciples? For three fantastic years they'd being living the dream. They'd been the entourage of the No.1 celebrity of the day. But there was more than that, more than just being the centre of attention in every town and village they visited. Deep down in their own hearts they knew that they'd found the One, the Messiah, the hope their nation had been waiting for. Life was making sense, miracles were happening every day, and they weren't just spectators - they were in the thick of the action. And then it all got a bit serious. They found themselves looking over their shoulders after dark. They started hearing whispers and rumours. And Jesus himself started saying crazy things about having to leave them to go elsewhere, to a place they couldn't follow Him.   
Today is a day of remembrance for us but not really a day of sadness because we know the end of the story. But for the disciples and the other close friends of Jesus this Friday afternoon was heart-breaking on an unimaginable scale. Jesus had tried to encourage them to trust Him but they'd just not understood. They couldn't see what He could see.  And how often are we just like them? When God allows sadness and suffering to cross our path we can quickly find ourselves feeling depressed or victimised because we don't see the other side. Paul reflects back on the 'frustration' of the whole world and says even that was 'in hope' of a future liberation. That's the liberation we celebrate over this weekend, Jesus bringing freedom to all creation through His death and resurrection!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE SET THE LORD ALWAYS BEFORE ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALMS 16:8 NIV</span><br>The words 'I have set the Lord always before me' are the simplest description of a spiritual life. There are a few signs God gives us to let us know He's involved in our lives: 1) Reassurance: Whether you're taking an exam, or moving to a different place, the message is: '...Do not be afraid. I am with you...' (Genesis 26:24 NIV).
2) Guidance: Maybe you're really confused about what to do about a situation and then an idea comes to you. It might be a big one or a small one, but it will help. Or you're about to say something that might hurt someone's feelings, and suddenly a little voice inside your head says 'be quiet.' 
3) Conviction: You're about to do something you know is wrong and suddenly you get the sense, 'no, don't do it.' Listen to that voice cause it will stop you from making unnecessary mistakes, help you to make the right choices and lead you in the plan and purpose that God has for your life. 
4) Joy: 'You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence...' (Psalm 16:11 NIV). It works like this: you make an extra effort, you hit the target and you feel a surge of satisfaction - that's what happened when God created the world. He was well chuffed with it, He looked at it and said, '...it was good!...' (Genesis 1:10 NIV). God can use any of those things to let you know he's around. If you '...set the Lord always before [you]...' (Psalm 16:8) you'll begin to be aware of Him everyday. How exciting that!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU SAW ME BEFORE I WAS BORN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 139:16 NLT</span><br>Imagine trying to live out of someone else's suitcase. Their clothes might be too big, their shoes too small. You wouldn't want to wear their underpants or use their toothbrush. Yuk! So why do we try to be someone we're not? We waste so much time trying to look like the latest pop star or super model; we get jealous of the popular people and even change ourselves just to get them to like us. But the fact is that fashions change like the weather, one day you're popular and the next you're old news. Our identity isn't found in a magazine or hanging on a clothes rail. As Christians our identity and security should be found in Jesus. What does that mean? Instead of letting your mates determine how you feel about yourself, you find out what Jesus thinks. How? If you get hold of a Bible, there are loads of bits in it that show you what God thinks of His kids. Check out Psalm 139, (it's near the middle); you'll start to get an idea of how much God cares about you. He has a purpose for you, the question is do you believe it? Listen: 'You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed' (Psalm 139:16 NLT).
If He bothered to take the time to make you He's going to make sure that His plan for your life isn't missed. Remember he wants the real you, not the fake you that's trying to live out of someone else's suitcase!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE SPIRIT HELPS US IN OUR WEAKNESS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:26 NIV</span><br>The Bible says that you are like a poem. Listen: '...we are His workmanship...' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV). It's immediately obvious but the word 'workmanship' actually comes from the Greek word 'poeo' which is used in our English word 'poetry'. So if you're 'His workmanship' then you're an expression of God's creative personality! No two poems and no two people are the same. '...we can each do different things. Yet the same God works in all of us...' (1 Corinthians 12:6 CEV). God uses all types: Geeks, Moshers, Skaters, Chavs; from people who are loaded to the poorest of the poor. Whether you're loud or shy, fat or thin, funny or serious, short or tall; in Jesus we all have one thing in common. What? He's given you His Holy Spirit to help you display the amazing characteristics of God in your life. By choosing to do things like love instead of hate and forgive instead of holding a grudge you are choosing to live like Jesus. 'The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others.' No exceptions. And when we work according to God's plan and not our own, our gifts affect the world we live in and in the end make an eternal difference. If you're read this and saying to yourself, 'that's ok for other people, but I'm just little old me, I can't do anything on my own.' You know what you're right that's why God gave you His Spirit, '...the Spirit helps us in our weakness...' (Romans 8:26). Without God's help you're stuffed so today let the Holy Spirit work through you and be who you're meant to be.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;GIVE, AND IT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:38 NIV</span><br>It's about 2000 years ago and Jesus has been busy teaching a crowd of people - and it's not just a little bunch of people; it's more like what you'd get at a big music festival in the park. The Bible says there were about 5,000 people hanging out listening to what Jesus had to say! It's boiling hot and on top of that Jesus knows the people must be hungry so He turns to one of His disciples and says, &quot;where shall we buy bread for these people?&quot; His mate is shocked coz he knows that even if he was loaded it would cost a bomb to feed that many people. But Jesus is just testing him to see if he would think, &quot;no way we can't afford it&quot;, or &quot;God can, so bring it on!&quot; Andrew, another disciple, tells Jesus that he's found a boy with a packed lunch containing five little rolls and two little fish. The boy hands over his packed lunch and sits down with the rest of the crowd. Jesus says thanks to God for the food and then gets His 12 disciples to start dishing it out. Can you imagine what must have been going through their heads? But as they did what Jesus asked, a miracle happened and 5000 people got a slap up fish supper. In fact there was so much left over they filled up 12 big baskets! 
The reason this is such a popular story is because it illustrates one of the number one things about Jesus: if you make what you have available to Him, He'll take it, bless it and then do a miracle!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE MUST BECOME GREATER; I MUST BECOME LESS</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:30 NIV</span><br>An MP took his 8-year-old daughter to visit Westminster Abbey. The awesomeness of it overwhelmed the little girl. As she stood gazing up at the high ceiling her father said, 'Sweetheart, what are you thinking?' She said, 'Daddy, I was thinking how big you seem at home, and how small you look in here.'
In God's presence, you might experience all kinds of things; love, happiness, acceptance. And sometimes you might just became aware of how little you are in comparison to Almighty God. God's presence has a way of humbling us. But what does that really mean?
Humility is an amazing quality to have; it means that you're respectful of others, that you don't live your life trying to get every one to notice you; that you check out ways to help people, even those who aren't thankful. John the Baptist was the bloke chosen to spread the news about Jesus coming. Loads of people grew to respect him and he had a load of groupies who would follow him around every where. But when Jesus turned up John had enough guts to step aside and let Jesus do His stuff. Listen: '&quot;He must become greater; I must become less&quot;' (John 3:30 NIV). It takes guts to be humble coz it won't always mean you get what you want. But, don't sweat it! God gets us humble for a reason. '&quot;...God opposes the proud but favours the humble&quot;' (1 Peter 5:5 NLT). A humble heart is like a flashing, bleeping signal on God's radar screen, and he looks to ways He can bless you and use you to play a big part in His plan and purpose.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...USING THE BOAT FOR A PULPIT, HE TAUGHT THE CROWD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 5:3 TM</span><br>Luke writes: 'He climbed into the boat...using the boat for a pulpit, he taught the crowd' (Luke 5:2-3 TM). When you read the Bible you see that Jesus had a knack of making the most of absolutely every opportunity. Instead of getting freaked out by the crowds nearly pushing Him into the lake He just hops into a boat and brings His words of wisdom from a new vantage point. But it never would've happened if the guy who's boat this was, Peter, had got all shirty about it. Can you imagine? 'Hang about mate, what d'you think your doin' in my boat, I've had a rough night and then last thing I need is you and your fan club wrecking my beach.' 
Later in his life Peter wrote: '...You are royal priests...As a result, you can show others the goodness of God...' (1 Peter 2:9 NLT). So how does that fit in with the boat story? Well, what does a priest do? He represents God to people - and you're supposed to do that too - every minute of every day! Yes, there should be no time or place when Jesus can't use your life as a platform to communicate his amazing love. Listen to what Paul says, 'Let every detail in your lives - words, actions, whatever - be done in the name of the Master, Jesus...' (Colossians 3:17 TM). 
Old preacher Henry Giles once said, 'There is no task so low that we may not elevate it; so dull that we may not enliven it if we understand that what we are doing is service to our Lord Jesus Christ.' So, the word 4U 2day is - be a platform for Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE SON OF MAN DID NOT COME TO BE SERVED, BUT TO SERVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 10:45 NIV</span><br>Jesus entered the world to serve. And we should do the same. Whether it is our school-world, our work-world, our community-world or our church-world. Serving requires no special training or qualifications. Here's three things to know about serving:
1) To serve is to love the overlooked. Jesus sits in your class wearing thick glasses, outdated clothing and a sad face. You've seen Him. Jesus lives on your street, pregnant again, no one knows the father. You've seen her. When you love the misfit and befriend the hurting, you love Jesus. '&quot;...Whenever you did one of these things to someone overlooked or ignored...you did it to me&quot;' (Matthew 25:40 TM). 
2) To serve is to wave the white flag. We fight so much: 'Where do you think all these appalling wars and quarrels come from?' asks James, 'Do you think they just happen? Think again. They come about because you want your own way...' (James 4:1 TM). Real servants don't fight for their rights if it means someone else will lose theirs.  No, real servants empty their own lives so that others can be filled.
3) To serve is to do something selfless every day. Pick up someone's litter. Let someone in front of you in the queue. Give up your seat on the bus. Tell someone you appreciate them. It doesn't have to be a big thing. Don't be too big to do something small. '...Throw yourselves into the work of the Master, confident that nothing you do for him is a waste of time or effort' (1 Corinthians 15:58 TM). 
Are you getting the message? To live = to serve.

So as you pursue your God-given destiny, be careful. Don't be so focused on the cool stuff you love to do, that you ignore the not-so-cool but really important stuff in life. Spending hours MSNing your mates might be fun but don't get so 'in the zone' that you becoming a stranger to your own family. Visiting your sick Gran may tinge your day with a sense of sadness but think about the happiness she will gain from knowing that you care. 
Famous writer Max Lucado says this: 'The world needs servants. People like Jesus who did not come to be served, but to serve. He chose remote Nazareth over centre stage Jerusalem. His dad's carpentry shop over a marble-columned palace. And three decades of anonymity over a life of popularity. He selected prayer over sleep. Flawed apostles over obedient angels. I'd have gone with the angels. Not Jesus. He picked people. When they feared the storm, He stilled it. He let a woman caught in adultery interrupt His sermon, a woman with a disease interrupt His schedule, and one with remorse interrupt His meal. Though none of the apostles washed His feet, He washed theirs. Though none of the soldiers at the cross begged for mercy, He extended it. And though His followers skedaddled like scared rabbits on Thursday, He came searching for them on Easter Sunday. The resurrected King ascended to Heaven only after He'd spent 40 days with His friends - teaching them, encouraging them... serving them.' So, today, who will you serve?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>EVERYTHING IS PURE TO THOSE WHOSE HEARTS ARE PURE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>TITUS 1:15 NLT</span><br>If you've been a Christian more than five minutes the chances are somebody (or lots of people) will have given you a hard time about it. One of the ways that people who don't have faith attack those who do is by suggesting that when you became a Christian you left your brain behind. To them Christians aren't people who think for themselves, they're people who just believe whatever they read in their holy book or whatever the bloke on cable TV with the funny hairdo tells them to. And they love to use words like 'narrow-minded'. But imagine... what if two people walk out into a field on a dark night and look up at the stars together. One of them sees the way the constellations hold together by perfect laws and she thinks about the connections between her and her family, her friends, the invisible ties of love and affection. She considers the beauty of the sparkling diamond light against the black velvet sky. Heart beating, she takes a deep breath, feels the chill of the air in her lungs and whispers, 'Thank you God.' He looks up at the same stars and thinks it's interesting that a cosmic explosion 14 billion years ago produced such a random scattering of hot gases. He wonders what he's doing looking up at the sky but decides it's better than watching repeats of Little Britain. He coughs and for a split second worries that bacteria might be multiplying in his lungs. He thinks about the ground beneath his feet spinning around the sun at 100,000 km/h and for a moment feels a bit dizzy. He says, 'This is boring.' So who's narrow-minded?

Moses grew up in a foster home - okay it was the King's Palace - but it never felt like home. He spent 40 years there learning the language and ways of the Egyptians. That's because God was going to use him to lead Israel out of Egypt. What better preparation for understanding your enemy than to be raised among them. But Moses also needed to learn some personal lessons, so God took him out into the desert for another 40 years to look after sheep. The poncey prince was now a scruffy shepherd. Nothing will humble you more than having to take a job for which you're overqualified, especially when it's your own mistakes that put you there. Those years out in the back end of nowhere brought Moses' ego back down to earth. Finally, at 80, he was ready to do the job God put him on the planet for. One day God called his name from a burning bush, 'Moses, Moses!' It was at this unlikely place that God revealed to Moses his calling as Israel's freedom fighter. And even though was scared and made stupid excuses, he ended up doing the job. The point is - Moses' life experience wasn't wasted. His years in the palace prepared him to deal with politics, and his years as a shepherd prepared him to lead God's people on a tiring journey into their destiny. So even though you may be going through a difficult time, smile. God never wastes an experience. Never! He'll use it for His fame and your fulfillment.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IT IS APPOINTED UNTO MEN ONCE TO DIE, BUT AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 9:27</span><br>Zig Ziglar tells the following story. It seems a gentleman worked on the 4 pm to midnight shift and he always walked home after work. One night the moon was shining so brightly that he decided to take a shortcut through the cemetery, which would save him roughly a half-mile walk. There were no incidents involved, so he repeated the process on a regular basis, always following the same path. One night as he was walking his route through the cemetery he didn't realise that during the day a grave had been freshly dug in the very centre of his path, so he fell into it. Desperately he started trying to get out, but his best efforts failed him. After a few minutes he decided to relax and wait until morning when someone would help him out. He sat down in the corner and was half asleep when a drunk stumbled into the grave. His arrival roused the first guy, since the drunk was also desperately trying to climb out, clawing frantically at the sides. Our hero reached out his hand, touched the drunk on the leg and said 'Friend, you can't get out of here'- but he did! Now that's motivation!
When you pass 50, if you're wise, you'll value time more than money. With hard work you can usually get more money. But when it comes to time - your clock is running out. Maybe a visit to your local graveyard might just be the thing to help you re-evaluate and reprioritise, and make the rest of your life - the best of your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BE RELAXED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 13:5 TM</span><br>Did you hear about the farmer who got so fed up with his farm that he decided to sell it? His estate agent phoned wanting to discuss the text for an advert she intended to place in the local newspaper. She read it to the farmer. It described a lovely farm in an ideal location - quiet and peaceful, with views of rolling hills, near a sparkling lake and complete with a herd of well-bred cows. The farmer said, 'Read that to me again.' After hearing it a second time he said, 'I've changed my mind. I'm not selling. I've been looking for a place like that all my life.'
The Apostle Paul learned a similar lesson which he passed on to his friends as a way of inspiring them to follow his example: '...I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances' (Philippians 4:11 NIV). Maybe you could learn from his example too? Do you get jealous of your friends? Do you blow your spending money all at once and then sulk until you get next week's - then blow it all over again? Do you spend your time ducking and diving trying to make a few quid extra but wearing yourself out in the process?  Listen: 'Better to have little, with fear for the Lord, than to have great treasure and inner turmoil' (Proverbs 15:16 NLT). Wise up and chill out! Make a regular habit of counting your blessings and thanking God for them. Thankfulness is the twin sister of contentment - so if you get friendly with thankfulness contentment will soon come along and introduce herself to you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BE RELAXED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 13:5 TM</span><br>It's amazing what boffins will do research on. Did you know that in 1900 someone did a survey and found out that the average Westerner wanted 27 different things, and considered 18 of them essential to happiness. 100 years later that survey was repeated and it was discovered that the average Westerner wants 500 different things, and considers 100 of them essential to happiness! And our obsession with all this stuff carries a heavy price tag. The average family now spends a quarter of its income paying off debts. The crazy thing is that a generation ago your parents would probably measure themselves against the Joneses next door, but now you have to compete with the star on the screen or on the magazine cover! 
Jesus warns '&quot;...Don't be greedy! Owning a lot of things won't make your life safe&quot;' (Luke 12:15 CEV). Be careful; as you stretch out for more, more, more, you risk losing the security that can only be found in God. It's really easy for a healthy interest in fashion to become an obsession about your looks, and it's equally easy for your computer hobby to become a desperate need to always have the latest release. Listen: 'You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you!' (Isaiah 26:3 NLT). Greed has many faces but it speaks one language: the language of more - and it speaks in a sexy whisper that you'll find hard to resist. If you want to keep your peace and stop greed getting a hold on your life you might try memorizing those words from Isaiah.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...OUR GOAL IS TO MEASURE UP TO GOD'S PLAN FOR US...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 10:13 TLB</span><br>If you've ever been to a footie match - at any club in England - you'll have heard a famous chant which has a thousand variations. If you were watching Man United play it would probably go something like this: 'There's only one Wayne Rooney, one Wayne Rooney, one Wayne Roooney!!!'  Well today, imagine your name in that chant, because it's absolutely true. God only made one version of you. He custom-designed you for a one-of-a-kind life. Even before you were born God had prepared a vast landscape of possibilities ready for you to explore. Deep in your soul He's placed a longing which will lead you like a SatNav towards your destiny.  And He's put passions and abilities in you that are going to help you get there.  Your friendliness. Your skill with computers. Your love of sport. Your gift for art and design. Look back over the last few years. What have you shown you can do well? What have you loved doing? It is at this intersection of your successes and your desires that you'll find your uniqueness. Today make a decision to never again say 'I can't do anything,' and also steer clear of its arrogant opposite, 'I have to do everything.' No, you don't! Paul said, 'Our goal is to measure up to God's plan for us.' Don't worry about you don't have and don't be jealous of what other people do have. Just remember that there's only one you - just keep following that SatNav in your soul! And if you're not sure where God's leading you, get down on your knees today and ask Him to give you a clue.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...EVEN THE DEMONS SUBMIT TO US IN YOUR NAME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 10:17 NIV </span><br>The two brothers were at it again, pillows, fists and swear words were flying around the bedroom. Most the time they got on but when they did start fighting nothing was going to stop them- well almost nothing! After 5 minutes, a smashed bedside lamp and the kind of crushing leap from the bunk bed that any WWE wrestler would be proud of, the boys heard a knock on the bedroom door. They recognised the knock and ignored it. Moments later, silhouetted against the light from the landing, stood the boy's little sister in the now open doorway. 'Stop fighting!' her small voice squeaked. 'yeah, whatever! dog breath' one brother cruelly responded. 'Stop fighting now!' the sister paused as a badly aimed pillow missed her head, 'Dad sent me!' Suddenly there was silence. The fighting stopped and the sister ran down the stairs smiling to herself. 
The sister could be bold and brave because even though she was smaller and weaker, she knew who had sent her. The only reason the boys listened to their little sister was because she had be sent upstairs by their dad; they knew if they didn't listen to HIM there would be trouble. Read Luke 10 and see the amazing things that happened when Jesus sent 72 of his disciples. People were healed, powerful things happened even the demons submitted to them - why because they were sent by Jesus. Jesus has sent us to share the Gospel in words and actions. Sometimes this can be scary, but remember who sent you. Amazing things can happen not because you are strong and powerful but because Jesus is. Go for it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE...YOU WILL ALWAYS BELIEVE IN HIM, ALWAYS EXPECT THE BEST OF HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 13:7 TLB</span><br>Sometimes the best thing people who love us can do is to let go and let God. Sometimes we're glad of the space, the opportunity to grow up, to prove ourselves and make our own way. Sometimes we wish they would step in and take away the problems so we don't have to face them.  Is someone you love trying to give you and God the space you need? Are they trying to let go? Is there a relationship or area in your life where you need to let go? 
To let go doesn't mean to stop caring, it just means you can't do it for someone else. To let go is not to cut yourself off from those I love, it's the realisation that you don't control them. To let go is to admit your powerlessness, which means the outcome is not in your hands. To let go is not to try and change or blame another, you can only change yourself. To let go is not to judge, but to allow another to be a human being. To let go is not to be in the middle arranging all the outcomes, but to allow the other to make their own outcomes. To let go is not to deny, but to accept. To let go is not to nag or argue, but to search out your own shortcomings and correct them. To let go is not to criticise and boss anyone around, but to try to become what you dream you can be. To let go is not to regret the past, but to grow and live for the future. To let go is to fear less and love more. To let go - is to let God!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...UNDERSTANDING OUR LIVES TOGETHER AS A CHURCH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 12:25 TM</span><br>Ever been to a wedding and as the bride walked down the aisle someone shouted out 'what a minger!' No, didn't think so!  Yet how often do you hear people moan about and criticize God's bride, the church.  Maybe you do too. No doubt your church has got it's problems, but today spend some time think about what a stunner God's bride can be. One amazing thing about church is fellowship - the sharing of the life of Christ among the members. This goes far beyond Sunday morning attendance or coffee and doughnuts (if you're lucky!) at the back of church. True fellowship happens when we're involved in each other's lives - caring, encouraging, correcting, loving and sharing with one another. In a world full of people desperate to belong, to be part of something, the church can provide us with a meaningful sense of belonging. 
Another amazing thing church can do is help us to worship Jesus, to draw close to Him and love Him. And our church teaches us about God in a way that can be understood and applied to everyday life. Church can also provide you with opportunities to use your gifts and talents to touch other lives, encouraging you to share your faith in word and good deeds. Church is amazing when it is doing what it should.
Hopefully this describes your church. But be honest! And if it doesn't, don't moan about it, pray about it. Today ask God to help your church reach all it's potential. Don't forget to ask God to help YOU to play your part in make His bride a real stunner!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHEN A BELIEVING PERSON PRAYS, GREAT THINGS HAPPEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:16 NCV</span><br>Sandra Aldrich, a Christian author says, 'Early in my widowhood as I prayed...about a possible move, I ended with, &quot;Thank you God that you'll show us what to do.&quot; My 12-year-old said, &quot;Mom you didn't say Amen.&quot; I nodded, &quot;That's because God and I are going to talk about this all day.&quot; And we did. Eventually my family made a cross-country move that opened a new career for me. But more importantly, I began a new adventure with God. Here's what she learned: a) you don't pray into thin air: where Sandra lives, Pike's Peak rises above the city...but when clouds obscure it we nobody says, 'The Peak's gone!' It's there even when it can't be seen... and God's working even when you don't see Him b) just jump in: James says, 'When a believing person prays, great things happen,' so while reading about prayer and learning about great intercessors can be helpful, you've got to start talking to God yourself c) there's no 'right' way to pray: one lady remembers her grandparent's prayers being filled with 'Thee's' and 'Thou's,' that made her feel unfit to pray. Then one day as she wrestled with a stubborn lawnmower she simply said, 'Lord, I really need your help.' Suddenly the responding roar of the engine gave her a fresh awareness of God's presence d) pray like you'd talk to a friend: Jesus said, '&quot;...Be direct. Ask for what you need...&quot;' (Luke 11:10 TM). Sandra says, 'My grandma talked to God so naturally that I'd wander into the kitchen expecting to see her chatting with a neighbour.' That's how to get results when you pray.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HER CHILDREN ARISE AND CALL HER BLESSED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 31:28 NIV</span><br>Today is the day when children everywhere bring their mum breakfast in bed, get some chocolates and flowers from the local supermarket and maybe, just maybe, offer to do the washing up! Hopefully today you've said a big thank you to your mum, or the person who has loved you like a mum. But if it wasn't for the giant pink posters the card shops have been displaying for the last three months, would you ever remember to say or do anything to say thank you? Let's be honest, we're all very good at taking our mum for granted. For example, how many times has she worked hard cooking a meal and then we work hard at whingeing about why we don't want to eat the veg? How many times has she bought you new clothes and you've thrown a strop coz they're not the latest fashion? 
Proverbs 31 paints a picture of an ancient Jewish woman of God. Of course today the activities have changed, your mum may not 'make and sell linen garments' or 'supply the merchants with sashes' but most of the characteristics you might recognise, take the time to read Proverbs 31 - it's quite a list. None of us have perfect mums and, lets be honest, we're not perfect kids. Maybe you can list your mum's faults with no problems but today sit and thank God for your mum's good qualities. Maybe you could write your own version of Proverbs 31 about your mum!?
Then tell her and anyone else who will listen, how amazing you think she is. Rise up and call her blessed!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...I SAW...THE PEOPLE...SLIPPING AWAY FROM ME.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 13:11 NRS</span><br>Approval-seeking cost Saul his kingdom. God had told him to wait for Samuel to come before offering the evening sacrifice, but because Samuel was late and the people were getting impatient, Saul disobeyed. When Samuel questioned him Saul said, &quot;When I saw...the people...slipping away from me...I...offered the burnt offering&quot;...Samuel said... &quot;You have done foolishly...The Lord would have established your kingdom...now [it] will not continue...&quot;' (1 Samuel 13:11-14 NRS). Saul compromised his future because he was more worried about what people would say that what God HAD said. 
Paul says, '...express truth in all things...' (Ephesians 4:15 AMP). Approval-seeking is basically dishonest, because approval-seekers aren't real about their feelings. Don't tell people what they want to hear, say what you need to say! You don't have to be rude, but don't be a wimp either. Just because somebody doesn't want to hear the truth that doesn't shut down your responsibility to speak it. 
Have you ever felt awkward about something somebody asked you to do? You're just not sure if it's what God would want. People call this 'not having peace', one way God leads is through a sense of peace. When you don't have peace about doing something it's OK to say so. In fact, people shouldn't expect you do anything unless you think God would be happy with it. If they don't like it - tough. Jesus told His disciples that when people won't '&quot;...receive...nor listen to your message, as you leave...shake the dust...from your feet&quot;' (Matthew 10:14 AMP). So, when somebody's reaction threatens to stop you from doing what God wants you to do or not do, shake it off and move on.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF GOD IS FOR US, WHO [CAN BE] AGAINST US?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:31 AMP </span><br>Let's get real today about how we live life: 'people-pleasing' is a miserable way to live. You always say yes to people, you want everyone to like you, you turn yourself inside out for them and just when you think you've succeeded, they change their minds. Apart from stealing your peace of mind, people-pleasing makes it impossible to follow God's plans for you, and ultimately that's your greatest loss. But to change this kind of habit of a life time isn't easy; it requires an act of real faith and asking God for the courage to follow through. David said, '...I know...you are with me...I...am not afraid. No one can harm me' (Psalm 56:9-11 CEV). And Paul asks, '...If God is for us, who [can be] against us?' Understand two things:
1) Dumping your desire to keep everyone happy means risking rejection by saying no when others expect to hear yes. Maybe when people are used to you doing everything their way, they'll react negatively until they get used to the 'new you.' But the people who really care for you will understand what you trying to do.
2) You may have to explain to others that in the past you looked for their approval because you felt insecure, but that's no longer the case. The important thing is to act now. Breaking any addiction involves discomfort and suffering, but the only other option is spending your life feeling trapped. You can choose to suffer short-term on the way to freedom, or long-term by continuing to run around desperately trying to please other people. So, which will it be?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...THEN WILL I...HEAL THEIR LAND.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CHRONICLES 7:14 NIV</span><br>King Solomon had finally finished building the temple. The work of 70,000 labourers, 80,000 stone cutters, and 3600 foremen - finished. Pure gold covered parts of the interior. Precious stones sparkled. Only the presence of God was missing. So Solomon prayed 'Now arise, O Lord God, and come to your resting place...' (2 Chronicles 6:41 NIV). What happened next? '...And the glory of the Lord filled the temple' (2 Chronicles 7:1 NIV). The people fell on their faces declaring, '...He is good; his love endures forever' (2 Chronicles 7:3 NIV) Imagine a whole nation worshipping God! After15 days of celebration Solomon went back to his palace. But keep reading the chapter... God hadn't finished speaking. God knew the nation's tendency to forget His blessings and go our its way. And what's changed? Look at our nation. Can Great Britain be saved? Yes! Look at what God said: 
1) 'If my people, who are called by my name.' We must turn from self-promotion to God promotion
2) 'Will humble themselves and pray.' We must turn from self-reliance to God reliance
3) 'And seek my face.' We must turn from self-direction to God direction
4) 'And turn from their wicked ways.' We must turn from self-indulgence to self-examination. When will God heal our land? When His people turn back to Him! 
If you should be on a smooth road and find yourself driving along a bumpy dirt track- you've made a wrong turn, it's time to make a right one. As a country we've been traveling on a rough and bumpy road. And it's getting rougher every day. What can be done? God's people can turn it around! And that turn begins with - you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...MULTIPLY THERE AND DO NOT DECREASE.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:6 NAS</span><br>God tells His people '&quot;I know the plans I have for you...plans to prosper you...plans to give you hope and a future&quot;' (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV). People often talk about this verse but rarely we think about what God says next. God didn't give the Jews permission to take that hope, then just sit back and do nothing. No, He told them exactly what He wanted them to do while He was working out some of the details for their future: '&quot;Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce...Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you...Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper' (Jeremiah 29:5-7 NIV). In other words, while you're waiting for God to turn things around, seize the moment. Become as productive as you possibly can. Maximise your potential. A lot of us, while we wait for God to work, think we can do nothing when there's plenty around to do. God said, 'Pray for the prosperity of those around you, because when they prosper you will too.' A lot of us don't understand this. We've become concerned about one person only - ourselves. When we mess up, the only person we tend to see is ourselves. But God says 'While you're waiting on me to do something good for you, begin doing something good for others.' That's what Paul meant, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive' (Acts 20:35 NAS). Then he added: '...the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does' (Ephesians 6:8 NIV). You see, by blessing others you literally open up a channel for God to come through when He blesses you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BE QUICK TO LISTEN, SLOW TO SPEAK AND SLOW TO BECOME ANGRY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:19 NIV</span><br>Do you find that you get in loads of arguments, always seem to be apologizing and having to make up with people? If you master the three instructions that James gives, the likelihood of that will drop big time. 
1)  Be quick to listen!  By staying calm and refusing to react, you gain insight - and respect! 'A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control' (Proverbs 29:11 NIV). 
2) Be slow to speak! Are you always butting in? Need to have the last word? If you talk too much or too fast, here are three tips to slow you down: a) stop. Just stop talking. Inhale. Count to 10. Excuse yourself and go to the loo! b) practice not interrupting. Allow the other person to continue what they're saying until they're through c) even if you're not arguing ask yourself: Why am I talking so much? Is it insecurity? Stress? The need to control? A desire to impress? The reason most of us try to convince, impress or control others is because we have a hard time trusting God to work things out. In other words, 'our talk issue, is a trust issue.'
3) Be slow to anger! If you observe the first two points you'll tend to come out all right on number three. It'll just happen. You can make progress on these three things - and you can start today. And if you do it consistently year after year you'll get to the end of your life and say to yourself, 'I'm so grateful that I took the wisdom of God seriously.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND WITH HIM SO THAT HE WILL LET ME TELL HIM ABOUT CHRIST...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 9:22 TLB</span><br>Josh McDowell writes 'An executive &quot;head hunter&quot; who goes out and hires corporate executives for other firms once told me, &quot;When I get an executive I'm trying to hire for someone else, I like to disarm him. I offer him a drink, take my coat off, undo my tie, put up my feet and talk about baseball, football, family, whatever, until he's all relaxed. Then when I think I've got him relaxed I lean over, look him square in the eye and say - 'what's the purpose in your life?' It's amazing how top executives fall apart on that question.&quot; Well, I was interviewing this fellow the other day, had him all disarmed with my feet up on my desk talking about football. Then I leaned over and said - 'what's the purpose in your life, Bob? Without blinking an eye he said &quot;To go to heaven and take as many people with me as I can.&quot; For the first time in my career I was speechless.'
There are basically five reasons why we don't share our faith more often:
1) We think it's the preacher's job 
2) We aren't sure of our own salvation 
3) We're scared of being rejected or laughed at 
4) We've never taken time for learning how 
5) Our love for Christ has grown cold. 
But not Paul: he said, '...whatever a person is like, I try to find common ground with him so that he will let me tell him about Christ and let Christ save him.' Can you say that? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I HAVE FINISHED MY COURSE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 4:7-8</span><br>Bob Ireland crossed the finish line on Thursday, November 6, 1986, as the New York City Marathon's 19,413th and final finisher - the first person to run a marathon with his arms instead of his legs! Bob, who was 40 years old, had his legs blown off in Vietnam. He recorded the slowest time in the marathon's history: 4 days, 2 hours, 48 minutes, 17 seconds. When asked why he ran, he gave three reasons: 
1) To show that being a Christian gives you a plus in life 
2) To test his conditioning 
3) To promote physical fitness and courage in others. 
'Success is not based on where you start' he said, 'it's where you finish- and I finished.' Wow! With two good legs and all our faculties, most of us won't even get out of bed an hour earlier to discover and pursue our God-given destiny. Success always comes at a price. The famous poet John Milton got up at 4 o'clock every morning to have enough hours for writing Paradise Lost. Noah Webster labored 36 years writing his dictionary, crossing the Atlantic twice to gather material. Another famous poet, Lord Byron, re-wrote one of his poetic masterpieces 99 times before publication, and it became a classic. David Beckham would stay at Man Utd's training ground longer then all the other players. Before Paul wrote: '...I finished my course...', he wrote: '...I have worked harder, been put in jail oftener, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again and again' (2 Corinthians 11:23 TLB). Go ahead, measure yourself by that standard! Then ask yourself 'Am I willing to do what it takes?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU WERE LOYAL WITH SMALL THINGS, I WILL LET YOU CARE FOR...GREATER THINGS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:23 NCV</span><br>What separates those who say they want something from God, from those who are prepared to pay the price to get it? For example, if you've been praying for that perfect someone to sweep you off your feet, ask yourself are you really ready for the sacrifice and responsibility that comes with a relationship? Are you stable, unselfish and mature enough to put someone else first? Or, if you're praying to do better at school, college or work, are you working hard, going the extra mile? Or are you more worried that your mates might think you're a geek if you put the extra work to be the best? Sometimes we're in love with the image of success, but we haven't counted the actual cost of succeeding. That's why it's a good thing God doesn't automatically give us everything we ask for! Often we want things because they look good in the lives of others, but God in His wisdom knows it would destroy us to receive what we're not equipped to handle.
God tests you with what you already have in order to develop consistency and strength. He wants to see how you handle the pressures that come with the blessings and life He's already given you. He wants to get you to the place where you can handle the hardships, and a place where you are more interested in the giver then the gift. And when you get there you'll hear Him say, 'You are a good...servant...Because you were loyal with small things, I will let you care for much greater things' - and that will make it all worthwhile!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...SIT DOWN AND FIGURE THE COST...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 14:28 TM</span><br>Will you pay the price? 
How many times have you prayed for a particular thing without realizing how much it would ultimately cost you? Success always comes with a price tag. God opening up doors, answering your prayers and giving up opportunities can be hard work. When He placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, they still had to do the gardening! Jesus said when you're 'planning to build...sit down and figure the cost.'  For example, when God gives you a breakthrough don't expect everybody around you to jumping up and down with excitement. Some people will give you a hard time.
Some will be jealous, often these people want what God's given you, but they're not prepared to pay the price you've paid. They can see you're running faster in the race but they don't want to push through the pain to catch up. James says, 'Where you have envy and selfish ambition...you find...every evil practice' (James 3:16 NIV). 
When your enemies are having a go at you, it's not easy. It's much harder when those who are close to you are giving you a hard time. It can be painful to be criticized by people you respect and trust, it's worse to veer from the course God's charted for you in order to gain their acceptance and keep them happy. If you KNOW what God has told you to do but you are scared to do it because you don't want your friends or your parents to be upset, be careful, you may be missing out on God's best. Talk and pray about it with someone you can trust.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...RUN TO WIN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 9:24 TM</span><br>If you've ever had to do 'cross country' running at school you will know that you can't just sprint as fast as you can for three miles. You need to pace yourself so when you finally reach the last 100m you can leg it to the finishing line, giving your PE teacher a cheery wave as you go (well maybe not!) Paul says, '...I'm running hard for the finish line...giving it everything I've got...I'm not going to get caught...telling everyone else...then missing out myself' (1 Corinthians 9:26-27 TM). Are you a Spiritual long distance runner? Have you set yourself a good pace? Or maybe things are hard and you are just walking slowly. Don't give up! For spiritual long-distance runners, quitting just isn't an option. Even if they have stumbles and disappointments along the way they know they'd never be satisfied standing on the pavements watching, they have to be out there running the race. 
So what's the secret to staying power? Paul said, '...Jesus...finished this race...Because he never lost sight of where he was headed...he could put up with anything...' (Hebrews 12:2 TM). Often we give up because all we can see is the how much it is hurting NOW! Ask any marathon runner they will tell you it hurts! You WANT to stop! But you have to keep your mind on the future, on finishing the race. It's the same for us. God can bring good even out of the painful times. Sometimes we need to have hard and painful times to strengthen our character. That way when greater blessings (and responsibilities) come, we won't crack. So don't give up, it's worth it!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;AND PRAY IN THE SPIRIT ON ALL OCCASIONS WITH ALL KINDS OF PRAYERS...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:18 NIV </span><br>We all can find it difficult to pray. Use these four simple words to help you:
1) Persevere: When you've been praying for something or something one for years and it feels like nothing is happening.  Jesus knew how easy it is for us to stopping praying when things don't start happening. Read Luke 18. Jesus tells a story to teach his disciples to pray and never give up. So hang in there and stick at it. 
2) Reach out: Prayer is so much more than presenting God with a shed load of needs and demands. Prayer is the way for us to reach out and touch God. God wants to spend time with you. Spend time telling Him how much you love him, trying sitting and just listening to him. Reach out to your heavenly dad 
3) Agonise: How much do we care about the things we pray for. Do you agonise in prayer or just half-heartedly mention something to God as you drop off to sleep? The bible is full of stories about God's people, going without food, weeping and crying, shouting and singing because they are desperate for God to do something. Get passionate in your prayers!
4) Yield: this is an old word which means to 'give way'. Sometimes the important thing about prayer is getting to a place where we are able to stop wanting things our way but let God do it His way. Jesus said during what must have been one of the most difficult times of prayer in his life: '&quot;...not my will but yours...&quot;' (Luke 22:42 NIV) Often it's not until we can echo those words that we see things change in our lives.

In it an African-American family inherits $10,000 from their father's insurance. The mother sees the chance to escape ghetto life. The brilliant daughter sees a chance to go to medical school. But the older brother begs for the money so that he and his friend can go into business together, and make things good for the rest of them. The mother gives in. Well, the 'friend' skips town with the money, and the desolate son has to break the news to the family. Immediately his sister lashes him with ugly words. Her contempt has no limits. Suddenly the mother interrupts her, &quot;I thought I taught you to love him.&quot; The daughter answers, &quot;Love him? There's nothing left to love.&quot; The mother responds: &quot;There's always something left to love. And if you ain't learned that, you ain't learned nuthin'! Have you cried for that boy today? I don't mean for yourself and the family. I mean for him: for what he's been through and what it done to him. Child, when do you think is the time to love somebody the most? When they done good? Well then you ain't through learning, because that ain't the time at all. It's when he's at his lowest and can't believe in himself 'cause the world has done whipped him so. When you starts measurin' somebody, measure him right, child, measure him right. Make sure you've taken into account what hills and valleys he's done come through before he got to wherever he is.&quot;'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T...DISCLAIM RESPONSIBILITY BY SAYING YOU DIDN'T KNOW...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 24:12 TLB	</span><br>Blaming other people for our weaknesses and mess ups is usually the way we avoid facing the truth about ourselves. Dr. Wayne Dyer says, 'All blame is a waste of time. Regardless of how much fault you find, it will not change you. The only thing blame does is keep the focus off you when you're looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration. You may succeed in making another feel guilty but you won't succeed in changing whatever's making you unhappy.'
The Israelites spent 40 years in the wilderness, on a journey that should have taken 11 days (see Deuteronomy 1:2). That's because they blamed God, and Moses, and whatever else they could think of. All their problems, frustrations and failings, everything that happened along the way, it was all somebody else's fault.  God knew they weren't ready to move on, so they went round in circles. Sound familiar? The truth may be hard to face, but hiding from it doesn't make it go away. In fact, until you're willing to admit your mistakes you'll keep having problems and go round in circles. Remember, satan loves you playing the blame game. And when you go there he wins and you lose! Paul said, 'Do not let yourself be overcome by evil...overcome...evil with good' (Romans 12:21 AMP). Did you get that? You get to decide how much ground you'll give to 'the accuser' (Revelations 12:10). Winston Churchill once said, 'The price of greatness is responsibility.' So stop passing the buck, get honest with God and let Him correct those things in your life that are out of order.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE WOMAN YOU PUT...WITH ME...GAVE ME...THE FRUIT, AND I ATE IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 3:12-13 CEV</span><br>We've all heard the stories: A bloke smokes three packs of cigs a day for 40 years, dies of lung cancer, and his family sues the tobacco company. A woman crashes while driving drunk, then blames the landlord of her local for selling her the drink. And there are a million variations on the theme. When we do something wrong, the excuses come flying - we've got hundreds of them! Our parents failed us...our friends let us down...somebody gave us bad advice...our mate doesn't understand us... in other words: IT WASN'T ME!  The blame game isn't new. In Genesis Adam and Eve gave God every excuse in the book to avoid responsibility for their actions. Adam actually blamed God by saying, 'It was the woman you put...with me...' And Eve was no better, she said, 'The snake tricked me.'
King Solomon says, 'The wise are glad to be instructed...fools fall flat on their faces' (Proverbs 10:8 NLT), because the ability to face up to your mess up is measure of your character and maturity. But more importantly, God can't forgive and restore you till you acknowledge and turn away from your sin. Nowhere in Scripture does God ever let you off YOUR sin because of what somebody else has done. In fact, when you make a habit of blaming the other guy you'll never reach the place of honest repentance. The Bible says we'll all '...appear before Christ and take what's coming to us as a result of our actions...' (2 Corinthians 5:10 TM). Owning up to your sins and shortcomings here and now frees you to receive God's forgiveness and move on to maturity.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE HANDED FIVE THOUSAND COINS TO THE FIRST SERVANT, TWO THOUSAND TO THE SECOND, AND ONE THOUSAND TO THE THIRD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:15 CEV</span><br>Jesus told a story about a businessman who gave some cash to his staff. The first two staff 'went and traded.' They looked at their various options, then took the plunge and dared to fail. And their Master said '...You are a good and faithful servant...' (v.21). The Bible says: '...earth and all its works [will be] exposed to the scrutiny of judgment' (2 Peter 3:10 TM). What does that mean? It means God will be looking to see what you've done with the life He has given you. So dare to take great risks for God! Not foolish risks, but prayed-over, well-considered risks in response to faith. The only mistake - is not to risk making a mistake. 
Check out what the third member of staff said: '&quot;I was frightened and went and hid your money in the ground...&quot;'(v.25). The first two invested theirs; but he buried his. The first two went out on a limb; he hugged the tree trunk. God gives us all gifts and abilities. Some use their gifts and give God credit. Others misuse them and give God grief. Some will big God up Him with fruitful lives. Others insult Him with excuses of why they didn't do this or that! 
Fear is the opposite of faith. 'And without faith it is impossible to please [God]...' (Hebrews 11:6 NIV). The bottom line is: step out in faith; He won't let you down. Take a risk; even if you fail several times on your way to success, God invites you to dream of the day when you'll feel His hand on your shoulder saying, 'Well done, good and faithful servant!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GIVE...YOUR WORRIES...TO GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 5:7 NLT </span><br>Kelly was a big time worrier, she was always thinking about what could go wrong! One day her mum said, 'Do you realize that 80% of the things you worry about never happen?' 'See,' Kelly replied, 'See! it works!' Talk about getting the wrong end of the stick!  Check out what Jesus said, '&quot;...don't get worked up about what may...happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever...come[s] up...&quot;' (Matthew 6:34 TM). Worry doesn't get rid of tomorrow's problems, it just robs today of any happiness.  A salesman who usually drove an old banger and wore outdated clothes turned up at his office one day in a designer suit, driving a BMW. 'What happened?' his mate asked. 'Remember how I used to worry about everything?' he said, 'Well, I hired a team of professional worriers; now I tell them my problems and they do all my worrying while I go out and sell and make money.' 'How much do they charge?' his friend asked. '£5,000 a week,' he replied. 'You're kidding! How can you afford that?' his mate asked. Smiling he replied, 'That's their worry, not mine!' Okay it's bad joke but wouldn't you like to have somebody to handle all your worries? Well, you do; His name is Jesus, and He said, '&quot;If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens...I will give you rest&quot;' (Matthew 11:28 CEV). God promised, '&quot;...as your day is, so shall your strength...be&quot;' (Deuteronomy 33:25 AMP). That's because He only gives us today's strength for today's needs. So instead of wasting today worrying about tomorrow, 'Give...your worries...to God...' (1 Peter 5:7 NLT), and get busy living the life He gave you to enjoy!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEACH US TO USE WISELY ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 90:12 CEV</span><br>As a kid, Tony Campolo says he spent many Saturdays at a famous museum called the Franklin Institute visiting Ed Bailey, the guy who ran it. Tony writes: 'His encyclopedic mind fascinated me. He knew something about everything... I was friends with Ed until he died. After a serious stroke I went to visit him... I told him all the places I'd been to speak and how I'd come right from the airport to see him. He heard me out, then said, &quot;You go all over the world to people who 10 years from now won't remember your name. But you haven't got time for those who really care about you.&quot; He continues, 'That...hit me hard and changed my life. I decided not to let all my time be used by people for whom I make little difference, while I neglect those for whom I'm irreplaceable. One day a friend of mine got a call from The White House asking him to consult with the President. He said no, because it was a day he'd promised to spend with his granddaughter. The nation survived...the President didn't miss him, and his granddaughter had precious time with her granddad.'
Somebody said that the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing!  In the Bible, David put it like this: 'Teach us to realise the brevity of life, so that we may grow in wisdom' (Psalm 90:12 NLT). We all get 24 hours, or 1,440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds every day, and we must make the most of them. So ask yourself today how you're going to spend the next 24 hours.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...MAKE EVERY MINUTE COUNT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 5:16 CEV</span><br>Pastor Adrian Rogers says: 'The misuse of anything as precious as time should be a crime. If somebody steals your car...you can acquire another. If they snatch your wallet...a few phone calls would salvage the majority of your concerns. But who can you call when you lose your time?' Wise old King Solomon reminds us we '...must give an account to God for everything [we] do' (Ecclesiastes 11:9 NLT), because for most of us, 'one of these days' generally means 'none of these days.'
How you spend your days is how you spend your life, so Paul writes: 'Make every minute count.' But how do you do that? Here's some ideas: 
1) Learn to say 'no'. Stress happens when your heart says no but your mouth says yes!' Don't let good stuff prevent you from being involved in really great stuff. That might mean backing off on some activities so you can make space for your higher calling. 
2) Learn to flow in the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, '&quot;...you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me&quot;' (John 15:4 NLT). He uses the image of branches in a tree - no life flows without a permanent connection being in place. The Holy Spirit is like the life in the tree constantly supplying the nutrients the branch needs to produce fruit. 
3) Learn to be spontaneous. It might look cool to be laid back about life but there's nothing cool about wasting your life. When God prods you to do something you don't say, 'In a bit' you get on with it straight away. Living like this will mean guarantee one thing: life will never be boring!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE HUMBLE IN THE LORD'S PRESENCE, AND HE WILL HONOUR YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 4:10 CEV</span><br>Has God put us on the planet just to chill out and have a laugh - or does He have a plan for us that involves that four-letter word: WORK!  
Firstly, we know from today's verse that God values humility and servant-hood, not pride and 'gimmee gimmee' attitudes. 'Be humble in the Lord's presence, and he will honour you.' If we are secure in our identity as God's child, we can get on with our lives knowing that, like the loving parent He is, our Heavenly Father will recognise and reward us fairly and generously. Knowing this frees us from being a desperate wannabee who needs to be the centre of attention. In fact, if being appreciated is your sole reason for doing a job, God may well allow people to overlook you until you sort your attitude out. You can be appreciated by your mates for just being you but once you get a job your personality takes second place to the stuff you actually get done! 
Secondly, God values courage and risk-taking. Think about the bold step David took leaving his home in the countryside and travelling to King Saul's palace. He must have felt seriously out of place in the culture of the royal court. Then later, after it became clear that his new boss was bothered by an evil spirit David kept his cool because he knew God wanted him there. 'Be humble in the Lord's presence, and he will honour you.' One day David would have his boss's position, palace and perks, but year after year he proved he could handle the hard work needed on the way to the top. Can you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A RIVER FLOWED THROUGH EDEN AND WATERED THE GARDEN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:10 NCV</span><br>Right at the beginning of our Bibles we find many clues about the original destiny God had in mind for the human race.  Today's verse is one of these clues. The Bible says, 'A river flowed through Eden and watered the garden. From there the river branched out to become four rivers' (Genesis 2.10 NCV). We can see that God made sure that the place he put his people had a supply of blessing - in this case, water. (Imagine what state the garden would be in without water!) But God didn't put a pond or a lake in the garden, He put a river there, a river that flowed out to the north, south, east and west. God's plan was never for the garden to be a secret oasis in a desert world.  His plan was, and still is, for blessing to flow out from the place His people are, to the world around them. 
So where has God placed you? And have you found the blessing He has placed for you in that place yet? Eden was a lot more than the river that ran through it. God placed other blessings there too, like all sorts of fruit trees, like companionship, and of course, God Himself would have a daily stroll in the garden too. Blessings come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. But looking out for blessings for yourself is not what the Christian life is about. The question to ask yourself today is, 'What can I do to make sure that the blessing I am enjoying is shared out to become a blessing to other people too?' Think about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE SAVED US THROUGH THE WASHING OF REBIRTH AND RENEWAL BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>TITUS 3:5 NIV</span><br>Paul writes to his friend Titus, '...He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit'. He is reminding this young guy who he calls, '...my true son in our common faith...' (Titus 1:4 NIV) of what things were like before he met Jesus, and then pointing out the amazing new life he has. 
Now then, if you've ever had your dinner and then left the dirty plate overnight until the food has dried on, you'll know those dishes need to soak in some hot, soapy water so that all the crusty stains can be removed. Well, in the same way we need to soak our minds in God's Word until the dirty stains that James calls '...all the filth and evil in your lives...' (James 1:21 NLT) begins to melt away. And we don't have to do this just for 'mega-sin', but also for hardened attitudes that keep us from growing in grace. Now this doesn't happen by just grabbing a Bible verse here and there. No, it calls for soaking yourself in the Scriptures until the Holy Spirit connects with your spirit and brings out the shine of Jesus in you.
As a new creation you have been created to please God. It's a bit like they way that a calculator is programmed to compute numbers. All you have to do is feed a calculator the right information to get the right answer. And you have been designed to do the right thing when you are fed with the Word of God. That's why it's so important to spend time in God's Word. So get your Bible out today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LIKE A MAN WHO LOOKS AT HIS FACE IN A MIRROR...AND...IMMEDIATELY FORGETS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:23-24 NIV</span><br>Your Bible is a mirror that shows you what you really look like in God's eyes:  'Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.' (James 1:23-24 NIV) 
Often when the word 'man' is used in the Bible it is a lazy translation of word that includes both men and women - but not here.  This word 'man' is the Greek word for a male, so we're talking about the way men use the mirror. Generally, men glance just long enough to get the basics done - then they're gone. But not women. They can be so keen on knowing how they look that they carry a mirror around! So, if the Bible is like a mirror showing us our true selves, we should approach it like a woman - not a man. We need to gaze into it again and again until we have fully seen who we are in God's eyes. 
You see God wants us to get real with ourselves so that we can make whatever adjustments are necessary. James continues: '...if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it' (James 1:25 NLT). In what area of your character do think you're still a bit of a minger? Give yourself a makeover by being a 'doer' of what God says instead of just a 'hearer'!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:5 NAS</span><br>Many people live their lives in a storm of destruction and chaos. They have been hurt and so they lash out and hurt others. They wear their sins on their sleeves. Other people seem to live life in permanent sunshine and would never hurt a fly. It's hard to imagine they actually ever sin. But both need God's amazing grace.  Listen: If you were on a trip to the zoo and a little lamb came running towards you, you wouldn't be scared because lambs are fluffy and cute. You might even reach and let the lamb lick your hand. But let's say you're at the zoo and the alarm goes out that a lion has escaped from its cage. If you're standing there and that lion comes running towards you, you'd be terrified because you know what lions can do. But just suppose that the runaway lion corners you - but instead of attacking you it licks your hand the way the lamb did! If that happened whose gentleness would you appreciate more, the lamb's or the lion's? You'd appreciate the lion's gentleness more because you know that he could just as easily have destroyed you. Well, grace is God's kindness and gentleness to us when He could have destroyed us as guilty sinners. But God wanted to welcome us into His family, so instead of expressing His anger towards us He found someone willing to take our place: Jesus, not just a good person, but the perfect Son of God. Jesus took the punishment that mankind deserved. In an amazing twist of the plot, the lion became the lamb. And now we can become friends with God. Isn't that amazing!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT ON THE FULL ARMOUR OF GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:11 NAS</span><br>An important key to the effectiveness of a soldier's armour is putting it on right so that the pieces fit together and provide maximum protection. So, how do you 'put on the full armour of God?' By prayer: '...pray at all times in the Spirit...' (Ephesians 6:18 NAS). Muttering a few words isn't enough, you need to pray specifically at the start of every day, asking God to clothe you with each piece of His armour. You wouldn't leave the house physically naked so don't leave it spiritually naked either. Again Paul writes: 'Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh...' (Romans 13:14 NAS). This is one of the best verses in the Bible on how to win over temptation. Don't give satan an inch or he'll take a mile.
Trainers who want to train dogs to listen to them and obey their commands no matter what, start the training by throwing a juicy piece of red meat in front of the dog. The untrained dog goes for the meat immediately, but eventually the trainer teaches the dog to keep its attention on him no matter what's put in front of him. When the process is successful the dog won't take its eyes off its master, even when the 'temptation' of meat is right under its nose. There's an important lesson here for you. If you keep your eyes on Jesus it won't matter what kind of meaty lie or temptation satan throws your way. Every now and then you may want to 'go for it', but if you keep your eyes on Jesus and listen to His voice alone, you'll beat satan every time.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT ON THE FULL ARMOUR OF GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:11 NAS</span><br>Let's look at the last three pieces of armour:
4) The shield of faith. Paul says that the shield of faith allows us to '...extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one' (Ephesians 6:16 NAS). Do you remember in the old western movies, the battles between the Indians and the settlers? The settlers would circle the wagons then the Indians would shoot flaming arrows into them. Smart thinking! You can't fight fires and enemies at the same time. Flaming arrows are a huge distraction, and satan uses the same tactic against us. But faith (and focus) puts out those flaming arrows. 
5) The helmet of salvation. This helmet protects your mind, which has to do with your new identity as a Christian. Your salvation isn't just a ticket out of hell, it's everything you are in Jesus Christ - a blood bought, totally forgiven, completely loved, heaven-bound child of God. 
6) The sword of the Spirit. Paul says that the sword of the Spirit is the Word of God. The Greek word for Scripture here is not logos, but rhema, which means an 'utterance.' This is talking about our speaking the Word rather than just reading it; using the right Scripture at the right time to deal with the problem at hand. Three times satan came at Jesus in the wilderness and three times Jesus answered, '&quot;It is written...&quot;' (see Matthew 4:4-10). He carved satan up with the Word. The devil can out argue and outdebate you, but he has no answer for the Word of God. So memorise the Scriptures, then use them as a weapon against your enemy.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT ON THE FULL ARMOUR OF GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:11 NAS</span><br>Let's take a look at the six pieces of God's armour described by Paul in Ephesians 6:14-17. The first three are things we wear all the time. The last three are things we pick up as needed for the moment. Let's check out the first three:
1) The belt of truth. 'Stand your ground, putting on the full belt of truth...' (Ephesians 6:14 NLT). During World War II, a plane flew many miles past its destination because the crew didn't realise they had a strong tail wind and refused to believe what the plane's instruments were telling them. All on board died. Sadly, when the plane was found years later the instruments were still in perfect working order. God's Word is your unbreakable instrument panel. Read it daily. Believe it no matter what your senses or the devil may be telling you. 
2) The breastplate of righteousness. The breastplate covers your heart, which must beat in sync with God's Word. When it doesn't, God sets off a warning beeper that something's wrong - it's not wise to ignore those signals. 
3) The shoes of peace. Shoes mean that you're going somewhere. Don't expect to hear from God if you never move off the same spot. When you move ahead for God He confirms you're going in the right direction by the peace He gives you. That puts a firm foundation under you. But why does God say, 'Stand firm' instead of 'Go fight? 'Because the battle has already been won! We're not fighting for victory, but from victory. Jesus has already conquered the big three - the world, the flesh and the devil. All we're doing is mopping up!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I AM AFRAID THAT JUST AS EVE WAS DECEIVED BY THE SERPENT'S CUNNING, YOUR MINDS MAY SOMEHOW BE LED ASTRAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 11:3 NIV</span><br>The human mind is an amazing thing. In fact just the fact that we have the brains we have and that we think the way we do is a powerful argument for the existence of God - the divine designer. But our minds are often a battleground, for example temptation always begins in your mind. Satan gave Eve the idea of eating the apple, Eve wasn't just standing there trying to figure out how to be naughty. You must understand that the first thought to do evil, isn't from you. God's given you a new nature which doesn't think of evil stuff. The devil studies you the way a footie Manager studies his opponents' matches. Satan knows your weak spots. He knows which temptation has the best chance of catching you out. How often have you ended up saying 'I promised God and myself that I'd never do that again,' yet you did it. That's because satan knows what works on you. 
But before you feel all weak and defenceless, God gives us this assurance: 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will [keep the temptation from becoming so strong you can't stand up against it]. When you are tempted he will show you a way out so you can endure' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT). God builds a back door into every temptation with a lighted 'exit' sign over it. So while it's guaranteed you'll be tempted, you can beat it. And the good news is, when satan discovers that his strategies and plans against you aren't working, he goes looking elsewhere.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ONE DAY AS THEY WERE WORSHIPING GOD...THE HOLY SPIRIT SPOKE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 13:2 TM</span><br>In Acts 13 we read, 'The congregation in Antioch was blessed with a number of prophet-preachers...One day as...they waited for guidance - the Holy Spirit spoke: &quot;Take Barnabas and Saul and commission them for the work I have called them to do.&quot; So...they laid hands on their heads and sent them off' (Acts 13:1-3 TM). Notice the following things: 
1) God called out Paul and Barnabas by name. God knows your name and where you live. Whether you're hiding in a cave like Gideon or gone fishing like Peter, God knows where to find you. He doesn't play hide and seek with His plan for your life. 
2) Their calling was confirmed by trustworthy leadership. Those who laid hands on Paul and Barnabas, confirming their calling, were leaders who took the time to pray, fast and seek God's will. Such people are a gift. They won't tell you what you want to hear, they'll tell you what you need to hear. They'll cover you, counsel you, correct you, and confirm God's direction for your life. Do you have people like that in your life? If not, get busy and find some. 
3) They found their calling in church. Why is that important? Because God gave us the '...pastor-teacher to train [us for service], working within Christ's body, the church' (Ephesians 4:11-12 TM). The Holy Spirit still speaks to us today as we get together to pray, worship, and hear God's Word. One reason so many of us go off track is that we aren't in the place where God can speak to us. Think about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...SERVE THE LORD ENTHUSIASTICALLY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:11 NLT</span><br>Life can be boring, so boring in fact that it stops you doing anything effective. Youth club can be same old same old, relationships can get tired, school or college is tedious, there's nothing to do at home. Enthusiasm comes from a Greek word meaning 'inspired by God'. When the Israelites wandered in the desert for 40 years God provided Manna for them to eat. Each day they had to collect it because it would go off. Like the Manna you need a daily dose of God's Spirit to '...fan into flames the...gift [He] gave you...' (2 Timothy 1:6 NLT). Even when life's dull, Paul encourages us to '...serve the Lord enthusiastically', adding, 'It is good to be ...[passionate and fully committed] in a good thing always...' (Galatians 4:18 NLT). 
So instead of going around complaining, put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. It's amazing how 'lucky' you get when you change your attitude! Sheldon Vanauken says: 'The best argument for Christianity is Christians: their joy, their certainty, their completeness. But the strongest argument against Christianity is also Christians. When they're sombre, sour, self-righteous and smug. When they're narrow and repressive, Christianity dies a thousand deaths.' Life wasn't meant to be a journey to the grave with the goal of arriving safely in a well-preserved body, it's a race to the finish line, used up, totally fulfilled, and loudly shouting, 'Wow! What a ride!' Poet Maya Angelou says, 'Life loves to be taken by the lapel and told, 'I'm with you kid. Let's go!' We should be the most enthusiastic people in the world, not only because we have a great future, but we have 'abundant life' now!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOLLOW THE LORD'S RULES FOR DOING HIS WORK...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 2:5 TLB</span><br>In 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' Lucy sees Aslan the great lion for the first time. She was afraid, and rightly so. Lucy whispered to Mrs Beaver 'Is he safe?' 'Safe?' Mrs Beaver replied, 'Of course he's not safe! But he is good, he's the King I tell you!' Narnia author CS Lewis was a Christian and it's no secret that Aslan is very much based on Jesus. 
God has many facets - which basically means he's loads of things all at the same time. He's your Dad, your best mate, your Saviour. He's kind and loving and generous and wonderful. But, at the same time He's King, He's a ruler, He's a judge, He's Lord over all, He's creator of the earth, He's really is a great big God! As God is all those things we have to be careful not to put Him in a box. Sure he's your pal and He's always there and he loves you to bits, but he's also God, Almighty God. The God in the Old Testament is the same God He is today. He's a no-nonsense God. He's not to be messed with and He's not to be picked up and put down when we feel like it. God's not Santa, his job is not to provide for your every whim. God is good, He is always right, He is kind and He is fair, but He's not safe. He won't be mocked and He won't be messed about. God is not a hobby or an interest. God is not to be feared, but He is to be revered. Think today about your actions, is God getting all the respect he deserves?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WATERS TO SWIM IN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EZEKIEL 47:1-5</span><br>Have you heard the story about frog that was born at the bottom of a well? He thought life couldn't get any better till one day he looked up and saw daylight. Climbing up to investigate he was amazed to find not far from the well a pond, much larger than the well he lived in. And going further a-field he discovered a lake that was bigger again. Eventually he came to the ocean and all he could see was water. Then it dawned on him just how limited his thinking had been. He thought everything he needed was down in the well, but that was a drop in the bucket compared to the things that were out there for him to enjoy. 
Maybe you're living today in your own little well, settling for a boring, average, safe, eventless existence, while God has rivers deep enough to swim in. Wouldn't you like to step out in faith, experience new depths in God and go where you've never been before? Remember, the enemy will do his best to keep you focused on your background, your failures, your appearance and your limited resources. But it doesn't matter what you're short of or rubbish at or missing. What God asks you to do will always be out of your depth anyway. You don't have to let fear stop you doing anything when God's in control, because His supply is unlimited! One idea from Him, just one, can change your life and the lives of others. He's got great things in store for you today - so start exploring outside the well!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE GREATEST LOVE A PERSON CAN SHOW IS TO DIE FOR HIS FRIENDS</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:13 NCV</span><br>When the Black Eyed Peas released their first single 'Where is the love?' it was an instant hit. The band shot to fame and youths across the world were singing 'Father, Father help us, with some guidance from above, cos people got me questioning, where is the love?' While it may make a good song one of the reasons for the size of the hit was that actually they were right, where is the love? The shops today may be full of naff cards, big flowers and cheap chocolates but is all of that really love? Remember Jesus? When he died on the cross he answered the question 'where is the love', and he passed it onto you.
We live in a world where we all have a number 1 attitude. We must look after ourselves and it's actually unusual for someone to be considerate to a stranger. What would you do if, on joining a queue for no reason the person in front offered to let you take their place? How many times have you seen an elderly person standing up on a full bus while a group of youths sit right next to them? So few people care about anyone but themselves we're shocked when anyone does something nice, no matter how small. The good news is that that makes it very easy to show people love and live out your faith. Doing something small will have a huge impact because in our culture it's not expected. So today, instead of worrying about how many cards you do or don't have, how about answering the question, 'where is the love?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I GAIN NOTHING IF I DO NOT HAVE LOVE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 13:3 NIV</span><br>Every teenager has a problem with their parents. It doesn't matter how great you are or how understanding they are, teens will always feel blamed for everything and parents will always feel their children are not being helpful. There are loads of reasons for this - often because teenagers actually aren't helping with life and generally making things more difficult, after all, teenagers do know everything! But what happens when life gets so bad that you're constantly at each others throats? In fact what happens when you're not getting along with other people too? Everyone has hurts and pains - undealt-with issues that can make you act a certain way. At some point those issues will be most at the surface and who do you take it out on? Those closest to you. In times of need we often take the people we need most, those who love and care for us unconditionally and instead of getting support from them, we chose to use them as a verbal punchbag. If you feel you're always being blamed for thing you haven't done, the chances are the person blaming you is having a hard time and just using that little thing as a way of expressing the pain they feel. So how do you react? Well it's simple, you react with love. In the midst of a fight with your mum, stop and tell her she's looking nice today. When arguing with your dad, ask him if he'd like a cup of tea. If your little brother's winding you up again, tell him you love him. It's impossible to fight with someone who is showering you with love and compliments! Love will calm a situation, stop an argument and bring you together. During your next fight, give it a try.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE IS NOT ASHAMED TO CALL THEM HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 2:11 NCV</span><br>Most families like to keep their family secrets a secret. Yet amazingly, you've barely dipped a toe into Matthew's gospel when you realise that Jesus comes from a less-than-perfect family. Rahab was a Jericho prostitute. Grandpa Jacob was dodgy enough to warrant an electric ankle bracelet. David had a personality as stable as a three legged table - one day writing Psalms, another day seducing someone else's wife. But did Jesus erase their names from the list? Not at all. So why did He hang His family's dirty laundry on the clothesline for all to see? Because if you look back your family has secrets too. A cousin with a criminal record. A dad who left and never came home. A grandparent who ran away with the company cash. If your family isn't as perfect as you wish they were, Jesus wants you to know 'I've been there.' The phrase 'I've been there' is Jesus' theme tune. To the lonely He whispers 'I've been there.' To the discouraged, He nods His head and sighs 'I've been there.' To the bullied and beaten He winces remembering 'I've been there'. Jesus wasn't scared to call His ancestors His family - and He's not ashamed of you either! Jesus, who makes people holy, and those whom He's made holy, are from the same family. 'He's not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.' That means He's not ashamed of you; nor is He confused by you. Your actions don't baffle Him. Your family secrets don't bother Him. So go to Him. After all, you're part of the family.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;FOR...WHEN YOUR FAITH IS TESTED YOUR ENDURANCE HAS A CHANCE TO GROW&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:3 NLT</span><br>Have you ever seen or been on a tree-top rope course? You work your way around a series of obstacles and go from tree to tree. The obstacles could be suspended tyres, a rope bridge, a thin log, or an unlimited number of other wood and rope combinations to make your way across. Sound difficult? Well life can be a bit like that, with one obstacle coming after another. You can't get off, you can't really go back, and you can only stay still for so long shouting 'I can't do it!' At some point you've got to move. The rope courses are very dodgy and it's easy to fall off. In your own strength you'd almost certainly fall to the ground and seriously damage yourself, and possibly die. So how do you do it? Well, there's a safety harness. You're permanently attached to a strong rope above your head and if you fall off, you can't fall any further than the obstacle you're on. God's just like that safety harness. We face trials and when we look down, boy, we can feel like we're about to fall big time! But we can't. Whether you have enough and decide to let go or try your very best and still slip off, that's when you realise He's got you -firm, secure, and you can't get away. You can have a little rest in His arms, then with His help climb right back on and keep going. There's no trial He can't get you through and however endangered you feel, you're never alone. He's not going to let you go, even if you want Him to!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHEN TROUBLE COMES YOUR WAY, CONSIDER IT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GREAT JOY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:2 NLT</span><br>Now, be honest. You've probably read today's verse and wondered if James was living on the same planet you live on. Now let's be honest, this has got to be one of the daftest things the Bible says. Trials and difficulty come along, life sucks and this is the moment you should be filled with joy?! That means you can't even complain or feel sorry for yourself. So how do you have joy? Well when life is interrupted by a trial or problem praise God! Worship Him, praise Him, hang out with him and tell people how good he is too. Why? Because the truth is, life is one trial after another and if we weren't joyful before, during and after them we'd never be joyful at all.  
James speaks of 'various trials'. You won't get bored by the trials you face because they'll come in every variety you can imagine. Notice, James didn't say 'if' they come, but 'when.' Will Rogers once read a newspaper headline 'Innocent Bystander Shot In New York.' 'How about that?' he said. 'All you have to do to get shot in New York is be innocent and stand by.' That's how it is with trials. You can't avoid them, just stand by innocently and you'll still get hit. But why? James answers: 'Under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true colours. So don't try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way' (James 1:2-4 TM). Problems produce maturity. The truth is, it can't come any other way!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...EVERY DETAIL WORKS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE AND TO GOD'S GLORY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 4:15 TM</span><br>When you were a child, do you remember being in school when the fire alarm would keep going off? Once a year a fire bell test was an exciting prospect but when it went through a phase of being faulty or because a group of naughty kids found it amusing to set it off every day it was purely irritating! Testing times come and go. Occasionally they can be a welcome distraction, something to make life a bit interesting, but normally they're like the fire bell; they're inconvenient, they're not fun and you can't just ignore it. Testing times can make us feel helpless, but there is one part of a test we can control - how we respond to it. Get this: testing times are essential to make you grow. In fact, we can't grow properly without them, as much as you wish you could. It's your standing the tests and trials that gives you a story to tell!  
Paul writes, '...Every detail works to your advantage and to God's glory: more and more grace...more and more praise! So we're not giving up. How could we! Even though on the outside it often looks like things are falling apart on us, on the inside, where God is making new life, not a day goes by without his unfolding grace...' (2 Corinthians 4:15-18 TM). And Job adds 'But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold' (Job 23:10 NIV). It takes a lot more heat to produce gold than it does tin. So which do you want to be?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ABLE TO DO IMMEASURABLY MORE THAN ALL WE ASK OR IMAGINE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:20 NIV</span><br>How big is your vision? Do you even have a vision? Martin Luther King Jr famously declared in one of the best known speeches in history: 'I have a dream'. Martin Luther King's dream was to see a future where blacks and whites would live together in harmony as equals. But Luther King's dream wasn't just a dream; a distant thought of 'wouldn't it be nice if'. He devoted his whole life to promoting nonviolence and equal rights for everyone and as a result he did more to advance the cause of Black Americans than anyone else has ever done. 
Martin Luther King's dream was a God-given dream. In a time where black people were not much better than slaves with hardly any legal rights, poor access to education, no right to be in authority, and no opportunity to have a normal job and provide for their families, surely Martin Luther King's dream was impossible? Well, he knew that the Bible says that God is able to do 'more than we can ask or imagine'.  But the verse doesn't stop there, here's the key part: 'according to his great power which is at work in us.' This verse tells us that:
1) No matter how big we dream, God can do way more than the greatest thing we can even imagine
2) He won't just do it, he does it through us! Can you imagine what the world would look like if Martin Luther King woke up one day having had his dream and thought 'that's nice, it'll never happen though' - turned over and went back to sleep?! If you don't have a dream or a vision, ask God for one today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THEY ALL CAME TO LIFE AND STOOD UP ON THEIR FEET - A GREAT ARMY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EZEKIEL 37:10 NLT</span><br>One of the biggest problems young people seem to have is apathy - not being bothered to get out of bed and actually do anything! It's one of satan's favourite secret weapons and half the time we don't even realise. Adults joke about teenagers always sleeping, watching TV, moping around and never doing anything and often there's no evidence to prove them wrong! But check this out: did you know that pretty much all the great revivals in history have started with teenagers? God absolutely loves teenagers! They have a vision, a passion and an energy that old people just don't seem to have! They've not had their thinking clouded or years of hard work making them fed up. Young people have an innocent faith that God absolutely loves, and rewards! If God says he can heal, he can heal, and he does! God frequently answers the innocent prayers of small children because it doesn't even occur to them that maybe he won't! 
So what does satan do when this vast army of energy, faith and passion is pumped and ready to slaughter him in the battle? He makes them fall in love with their bed, or their Playstation, or their TV, or their chatrooms - anything to keep them in their pyjamas! In a recent song by the Killers the line is repeated - 'I've got soul but I'm not a soldier'. How many of you feel that way? Like there's a passion and warrior deep down inside, but you just can't get up off your backside. Read Ezekiel 37 today. God wants to raise up an army in this generation, and he's waiting for you to join in.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL EXPERIENCE ALL THESE BLESSINGS IF YOU OBEY THE LORD YOUR GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 28:2 NLT</span><br>Jack London's classic story, White Fang, is about an animal, half dog, half wolf, who learns to live among men. White Fang loved chickens. Once he raided a chicken-roost and killed 50 hens. His master, Weedon Scott, who White Fang loved, told him off, then took him into the chicken yard. When White Fang saw his favourite food walking around in front of him, he did what any half dog half wolf would do and went for them. Immediately he was called by his master's voice. He stayed in the chicken yard quite a while, and every time White Fang made a move toward a chicken, his master's voice would stop him. By doing this he learned what his master wanted - he learned to ignore the chickens. Weedon Scott's father said 'You couldn't cure a chicken killer' but Weedon challenged him and they agreed to lock White Fang in with the chickens all afternoon: 'Locked in the yard, White Fang lay down and went to sleep. Once he walked over to the trough for a drink. He calmly ignored the chickens. As far as he was concerned they did not exist. At 4 o'clock he did a running jump and leaped to the ground outside, where he sadly wandered back to the house. He had learned the lesson. Because of love he wanted to do what his master wanted and White Fang overcame his natural, inborn tendencies. He may not have understood the reason, but he chose to change what he wanted to do in place of what his master wanted. Life's full of chickens. What are yours?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...YOU ARE ONE OF THEM...YOUR SPEECH SHOWS IT.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 14:70 NKJV	</span><br>You can hide who you are by changing your address, clothes and name-but how you speak will give you away every time. It happened to Peter. After Peter said he didn't know Jesus twice people said to him '&quot;...you are one of them...your speech shows it&quot;' (Mark 14:67-70 NKJV). So, to convince them that he wasn't a friend of Jesus, Peter 'Began to curse and swear, &quot;I do not know this Man of whom you speak!&quot;' (Mark 14:71 NKJV). And it worked! With a mouth like that no one accused him of knowing Jesus again. Using bad language in any setting will make people question the quality of your relationship with Jesus. 
Swearing is becoming more and more common amongst Christian young people and youth groups. People use arguments like 'it doesn't matter that much' or 'it stops people thinking we're geeks'. The bad news is, they're the world's worst arguments! You will be judged on your language by other people and swearing in front of non-Christians won't make them think you're a 'cool' Christian, they'll just think you're a rubbish Christian. Paul says, 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up...that it may benefit those who listen' (Ephesians 4:29 NIV). If you want to win people to Jesus, start with how you talk. Words are powerful things. They either build up or tear down, add to or take from. It's not important that people can tell from your accent where you're from, but when they can't tell by the way you talk that you know Jesus, something's seriously wrong.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...[THE] MANY PARTS MAKE UP ONLY ONE BODY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 12:12 TLB</span><br>There's a story about Jimmy Durante, one of the truly great showbizzy style entertainers. He was asked to do a show for some old guys who'd fought in World War II. He told them he was very busy, but if they wouldn't mind his doing one short monologue and immediately leaving for his next appointment, he'd come. They agreed. But when Jimmy got on stage he went through the short monologue - then stayed, and stayed. Soon he'd been on stage 15, 20, then 30 minutes. Finally he took a last bow and left. Backstage someone stopped him and said 'I thought you had to go after a few minutes. What happened?' Jimmy answered, 'You can see for yourself if you look on the front row.' In the front row were two veterans who had both lost an arm in the war. On their own they were silent but together they were able to clap, and they did, loudly and cheerfully.
That's a picture of what's supposed to happen in church: 'But the many parts make up only one body when they are all put together.' The fact is no matter how good you think you are you can't do everything on your own. There are other people there who can help and support you and people you can support in return. Sitting at the back of church having a laugh with your mates is just not good enough! Even when you're young you've got a part to play. You've got energy, passion and enthusiasm that the oldies just don't have. It's your time to get up there, not to sit back!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LET'S...BE WHAT WE WERE MADE TO BE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:6 TM</span><br>The worst kind of life is a life without meaning; stuck in the same old routine. Do you ever feel like this?: 'Every day you get out of the same old bed and go to the same old bathroom to look at the same old face in the same old mirror. You go to the same old wardrobe to choose from the same old clothes then down to the same old breakfast at the same old table. You check the same old mobile for new messages and find the same old story - there are none. You grab your same old bag and go down to the same old bus stop with the same old people to get on the same old bus. You go the same old place, do the same old stuff then get on the same old but to come back to the same old place. You watch the same old TV with the same old stuff and get in the same old bed to do the same old thing again.'  
God didn't create you, and He most certainly didn't die for you, to live a boring, pointless life. God's given you a life worth living, a job to do and it's guaranteed not to be a dull one! You could go anywhere, speak to anyone, do anything. It's scary, it's exciting, it's fulfilling, it's hard work, it's a rollercoaster but there's no same old same old! So figure out what God wants you to do different today, step out in faith, break the mould and just do it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...WHEN YOU PRAY...CLOSE YOUR DOOR...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:6 NAS</span><br>Jesus said '&quot;...when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you&quot;' (Matthew 6:6 NAS). Just think about that for a moment. How many times have you sat in church and heard someone pray out this wonderful prayer with such huge words and clever images you're sat there thinking a) I could never pray like that and b) how can God not answer that prayer, it's amazing! Well here's an interesting thought, prayer's not about genius metaphors or using massive words that rhyme! What God wants from you is a private conversation - just you and Him, where you're real and honest and so's He!   
When people say they don't know how to pray, what they mean is they don't really know the 'in' phrases. Well guess what, if you say 'God you're wickid', He won't think your saying He's evil - He knows your heart and yes, He even knows slang (He even understands tongues remember!). You don't have to get the words right. God just won't care - in fact He'll probably be more upset if you try to talk to Him like He's the Prime Minister because he wants to be your mate! There's no heavenly bonus points for using posh words or Christian jargon. You don't even get extra points for a picture of a waterfall! Prayer is like breathing. It should be natural, part of us. What we need and do to survive. Chat to God on the bus, washing up, even on the loo. He's always there, always listening and desperate for a conversation! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;[COME]...BE MY DISCIPLE&quot;...SO MATTHEW GOT UP AND FOLLOWED HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 9:9 NLT</span><br>According to the Jews, tax collectors were pretty much the lowest scum bags of the day, so needless to say Matthew the tax collector was not the most popular guy on the block. If he walked down the road, people stayed out of the way - everyone except Jesus that is. '&quot;[Come]...be my disciple&quot;...So Matthew got up and followed Him.' Then it gets interesting. '[Matthew] gave a big dinner for Jesus at his house. Many tax collectors...were eating there, too' (Luke 5:29 NCV). Imagine that party - it wasn't a dinner party in the middle class British sense of the phrase dinner party, 'Oh I say, would you be so good as to pass me the salt please Marjorie?' It was probably more like an ancient version of what we now simply refer to as sex, drugs, rock and roll. It was definitely the kind of thing we're taught as Christians to stay away from! But, a friend is a friend. What can Matthew do? Ditch his old mates for Jesus? No, in fact Matthew did the opposite; he invited them to meet Jesus too! Everyone was having a top time until the religious types stepped in and started complaining. Jesus' response was simple. 'I have come to call sinners...not to spend my time with those who think they are already good enough' (paraphrased, see Matthew 9:13). You see many people have lost sight of what's important. In fact some Christians are so terrified of the outside world and all it's evil they lock themselves away in churches just waiting for the day they can scarper. It's ridiculous! So remember today, don't ditch your old mates, they need Jesus too! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEST ME, O LORD...EXAMINE MY HEART AND MY MIND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 26:2 NIV</span><br>OK, it's the end of the month and the last instalment of our mini-series on testing. Here's the final test: The Lordship test. Simon Peter passed this test by obeying a command that seemed to make no sense at all: Jesus said to him, 'Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.  Simon answered, &quot;Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.&quot; When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break' (Luke 5:4-6 NIV). 
Even though we've seen God do so much in our lives, it's still so easy to catch ourselves thinking that we know best. Especially when we think experience has proved us right. For example, when we've tried something time and time again and feel like giving up.  When Jesus says 'stick at it', it's easy to think: 'haven't you seen what happened? It's just not working!' 
This was early days in Peter and Jesus' relationship, it would have been easy for Peter to think: 'hang on, I've been a fisherman all my life. What can this preaching carpenter teach me about catching fish' - But he didn't. He said 'Because you say so....' First Peter tried fishing alone and failed. Next he tried it with Jesus and succeeded. Same fisherman. Same boat. Same nets. What changed? He was willing to do it God's way! Passing the Lordship test means trusting that Jesus knows best even when your experiences or circumstances say otherwise.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEST ME, O LORD...EXAMINE MY HEART AND MY MIND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 26:2 NIV</span><br>Today we're going to look at 2 more tests: 
1) The offence test. Jesus said, '&quot;...offences will come...&quot;' (Luke 17:1 KJV) None of us live in a protective bubble. There will always be someone out there who will be able to offend you. So, what are you going to do? Get mad and get nowhere? Get even and get into trouble? Or get over it by practicing forgiveness. '&quot;...if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins&quot;' (Mark 11:25 NIV). Enough said! 2) The warfare test. This test is for those who claim to be strong in faith, but prove to be weak in fight. 'When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, &quot;If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt&quot;' (Exodus 13:17 NIV). If your destiny is worth pursuing - it's worth fighting for! So, toughen up! It's a battlefield, not a bed of roses. You must engage the enemy each day using each spiritual weapon at your disposal (check out Ephesians 6:10-18). The enemy will tempt you, accuse you, lie to you, discourage you and chuck problems at you. Hang in there. This test demonstrates your ability to hack it and keep going even while you're experiencing disappointment and opposition. So remember, the level of attack is the best indicator as to the level of blessing that waits for you beyond the attack!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEST ME, O LORD...EXAMINE MY HEART AND MY MIND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 26:2 NIV</span><br>Let's take a look at three more tests: 
1) The wilderness test. This test comes when we feel spiritually dry and everything feels like hard work. It proves we're able to trust God even when life isn't fun. 'He led you through the vast and dreadful desert...to...test you so that in the end it might go well with you' (Deuteronomy 8:15-16 NIV). The wilderness test is where we put up with short-term pain, confident that in the end it'll produce long-term gain 
2) The credibility test. Do you walk the talk? Have earned the right to be trusted? When Lot tried to warn his son-in-laws that their city was going be wiped out they '...thought he was joking' (Genesis 19:14 NIV). They'd probably seen his selfish treatment of his Uncle Abraham, and heard about his shady business dealings. As a result he lost his credibility when it mattered most. Is that happening to you? 
3) The authority test. Before Paul took the radical step of telling non-Jews about Jesus, he first went to Jerusalem and submitted his controversial plan to the church leaders, asking for their OK. He didn't have a 'Nobody is going to tell me what to do' attitude. God loves that! He loves it when we respect our leaders even the ones that wind us up. King Saul tried to kill David (and you thought your teacher / boss is bad!) Even though David got out of there pretty fast, he continued to show respect refusing to bad-mouth or harm Saul.  David passed the authority test and later took Saul's place as King.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEST ME, O LORD...EXAMINE MY HEART AND MY MIND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 26:2 NIV</span><br>Let's look at some of the tests God uses to develop us:
1) The test of small things. This test comes when we're asked to do something we think is &quot;beneath us&quot;. Something we think is for people not as gifted, experienced or &quot;important&quot; as us.  But it's not just about the star striker sometimes becoming the boot cleaner-it also reveals whether or not we're ready for greater responsibilities. God is watching us do acts of kindness, prayer, bible study-these might seem like little things but Jesus said, '&quot;Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much...&quot;' (Luke 16:10 NIV) 
2) The motive test. This test comes to us when we are doing all the right things - but not necessarily for all the right reasons. It's right to pray. Yet Jesus warned: '&quot;When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love...to be seen by men...&quot;' (Matthew 6:5 NIV). That's why we need the mirror of God's Word: 'For the word of God is...able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart' (Hebrews 4:12 NAS). As you get into the Bible, let it not just be a guide to what you do in your life, but why you do it? 
3) The stewardship test. Jesus said, '&quot;Give, and it will be given to you...&quot;' (Luke 6:38 NIV). The practice of giving on a regular basis prevents you from being owned by what you own. When you withhold out of fear or greed, you limit what God wants to give you. Become a river, not a reservoir.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEST ME, O LORD...EXAMINE MY HEART AND MY MIND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 26:2 NIV</span><br>Sometimes stuff happens in life and it feels like God is testing us. The thing about tests is they demonstrate what you've learned. Until you're tested you really don't know what you know - and what you don't know. Tests are opportunities to prove your maturity and your potential. So remember: 
a) you'll experience tests at each stage of your growth b) your goal in each case should be to pass the test, otherwise you get to take it again and again until you get it right c) testing always comes before God gives you something better. Actually, it prepares you for it and proves you're ready to handle it. If you cheat, or take things on before you are ready, you temporarily seem to succeed. But eventually time and circumstances will reveal you for what you are - someone who can't handle what you manipulated your way into getting d) a new product can't be safely used until it's been thoroughly tested. Neither can you. God's not a hard-hearted parent who enjoys seeing His children struggle through life's tests. If He were to visit you in person He'd probably say: 'I don't enjoy making you go through this, but it's the only way to prove you're ready for what's ahead. Before I can use you greatly - I must test you thoroughly.' Generally God's tests are about your character- the person God wants you to be. And like any good actor in a stage play your job is to 'stay in character!' even when it looks like life is not going according to the script.

And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers&quot;' (Luke 22:31-32 NIV). Notice:  
1) Jesus warned Peter about what would happen, but He didn't stop it from happening. There are certain things we only learn the hard way.  
2) Peter thought he was stronger than he was: '&quot;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death&quot;' (Luke 22:33 NIV). We usually start out with an exaggerated opinion of our own strength.   
3) Jesus told him, 'I'm praying for you that your faith may not fail.' Isn't that amazing? When we're so low that we can't pray for ourselves, Jesus handles the enemy and prays to the Father on our behalf. What did Jesus pray for? Peter's faith! Having faith in God's grace and forgiveness is the rope that pulls us back up again.  
4) Jesus believed in Peter even when Peter didn't believe in himself. That's because we measure ourselves by what state we are in right now, but Jesus sees what will be the fullness of our potential. So He tells Peter, 'When (not if) you get back on track, do something good with what's happened' (Paraphrase). Now, if temporary failure happened to Peter, how much more likely is it to happen to you? And when it does, what do you suppose God wants to accomplish through it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PREPARE YOUR MINDS FOR ACTION; BE SELF-CONTROLLED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 1:13 NIV</span><br>We love the idea of being great at something, we love to think about the respect, money and fame that might come our way - but do we think about what it takes to get there? We're more into the glamour of achievement than the grittiness of it. Jamie Clark writes about the grit that's required in preparing to climb Mount Everest: 'In order to get yourself up for the climb, you spend several hours a day walking on a treadmill with a heavy back-pack. You look goofy, you smell. It's an ugly scene. That's always true. The road to success is not pretty.' The winners in life know this and it doesn't put them off. They understand the words of Peter, 'Prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled...' And as you know, Paul said: 'Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training...' (1 Corinthians 9:25 NIV). Note the word 'strict'. If you're not strict with yourself you won't make it. People might think the disciplined person has 'no life', 'is obsessed', 'needs to live a bit'. It's only after the season of discipline is over and the payoff comes, that the world offers applause. The runner, the swimmer, the footballer all push their bodies to extreme levels of performance. They don't stop simply because they feel shattered or even pain. They understand that these are mental barriers that must be overcome. They insist that their bodies come in line with their commitment, not their comfort. And the same is true of every follower of Jesus who responds to a call from heaven to undertake a great task. Don't hold back!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...AND IT WAS VERY GOOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:31 NIV</span><br>God knew the 'you-shaped' purpose you were born to fulfil, so He provided all the gifts you'd need. Having designed you, God stands back and with a satisfied grin says 'Very good.' Can you say that about yourself? It's important that you can. Why? Because others will treat you according to how you treat yourself! This is not pride, it's just healthy self-esteem based on God's opinion of you. When you have it, it affects every area of your life. Truth be told, it determines how far you'll go in life. Stop and ask yourself today, 'How do I really feel about myself?' Be honest!  Then read these 10 principles:
1) Never think or speak negatively about yourself, GOD DOESN'T!  
2) Spend time thinking about your God-given strengths and learn to encourage yourself, for much of the time nobody else will  
3) Don't compare yourself to anybody else. You're unique, one of a kind, an original. So don't settle for being a copy  
4) Focus on your potential, not your limitations. Remember, God lives in you!  5) Find what you like to do, do well, and strive to do it with excellence  
6) Have the courage to be different. Be a God pleaser, not a people pleaser  7) Learn to handle criticism. Let it develop you instead of discourage you  
8) Determine your own worth instead of letting others do it for you. They'll shortchange you!  
9) Keep your shortcomings in perspective - you're still a work in progress.  
10) Focus daily on your greatest source of confidence - the God Who lives in you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE FIRST THING ANDREW DID WAS TO FIND HIS BROTHER SIMON [PETER] AND TELL HIM, &quot;WE HAVE FOUND THE MESSIAH.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 1:41 NIV</span><br>Pastor Tony Evans writes: 'I was born and raised in the inner-city. By the time I was about ten, my parents...looked to be heading for divorce. But then one day everything changed; someone witnessed to my father and he accepted Christ. My father developed the habit of getting up at midnight, praying that God would save his family. This went on for some time. One night my mother came downstairs to the living room where my father was praying. She began crying even before she reached the living room. When my father asked what was wrong, with anguished tears and a desperate heart she said the unforgettable: 'The worse I am to you, the better you are to me, so whatever you have must be real. How can I have it too?' That night my father led my mother to Christ. Not long after that my parents led their four kids to Christ too. I was the oldest. I was saved at 11, felt the call to be a minister by the time I entered my teens, and was totally ministry-oriented by the time I hit 18.' Since that day Tony Evans has led a great Church, preaches daily on hundreds of radio stations, and reaches thousands for Christ each year. The Bible talks about Andrew bringing his brother Peter to meet Jesus. And Peter eventually introduced thousands to Jesus at the end of his first sermon and that was just the beginning. But whose contribution mattered most?  Both!  So pray, encourage, witness, and reach out as God directs you. You never know what a big harvest your small seed will produce.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU...ARE...GOOD...TO GIVE YOU A FUTURE AND A HOPE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:11 TLB</span><br>Do you feel trapped in an impossible situation you can't seem to change or escape? If so, God is saying to you today, '...The plans I have for you...are... good...to give you a future and a hope.' Hope is one of those words that we use all the time, but how would you define it? Real hope is not just when despair or worries are taken out of the picture, It's when something greater is added; something only God can give. Hope isn't just about doing nothing but wishful thinking; it's the most active force in the world because it's comes from the most powerful being of all - God. And it's never further away than He is. Clint Eastwood became famous for starring in the kind of yellowy westerns your uncle Ken watches on Sunday afternoons.  One movie is called The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and occasionally you can still catch people describing life with those words. But here's the good news: through His amazing grace God can take the good, the bad and the ugly experiences in your life and use them to make you unbelievably better at what He created you for, whatever that might be! The way God works is to take EVERY bit of life and redeem it (buy it back for Him to use). He can take the good things we remember fondly, the bad things we might like to forget, and the ugly things that shaped us into people we didn't start out to be, and use all of them to make possible His purpose for each and every one of us. So, don't give up hope!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST?...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:35 NAS</span><br>God thinks you are amazing, awesome, mint, pukka, top, safe, skill, great, brill, fandabbydozy, lush, awfully nice! Get the idea? God is mad about you. Even your darkness moments and greatest mess ups can't stop Him loving you or get in the way of Jesus' blood bringing you forgiveness. It doesn't take us long to list off all the reasons why God is much better off without us. Why doesn't he start looking for a receipt so He can get a refund on us, or at least exchange us for a version that doesn't have so many faults. But God hasn't given up on you, dumped or replaced you. He died for you. The devil will diss us and accuse us, tell us we are losers and wasting God's time. Sometimes we get sucked in by those lies but God doesn't! Check this out '...And who would dare tangle with God by messing with one of God's chosen? Who would dare even to point a finger? The One who died for us-who was raised to life for us!-is in the presence of God at this very moment sticking up for us. Do you think anyone is going to be able to drive a wedge between us and Christ's love for us? There is no way! Not trouble, not hard times, not hatred, not hunger, not homelessness, not bullying threats, not backstabbing, not even the worst sins listed in Scripture: ...None of this fazes us because Jesus loves us. I'm absolutely convinced that nothing-nothing living or dead, angelic or demonic, today or tomorrow, high or low, thinkable or unthinkable-absolutely nothing can get between us and God's love because of the way that Jesus our Master has embraced us'. (Romans 8: 31-39 TM)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...RUN IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU MAY WIN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 9:24 NAS</span><br>The Isthmian Games took place in Corinth every 2 years. Anyone could enter and they all wanted to win! To serious athletes winning is everything! So, what's the secret to winning? 'Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things...' (1 Corinthians 9:25 NAS). They watch their diet, get plenty of sleep and train their bodies in just the right way. They won't do things that could limit their performance on the track so they measure the consequences of every indulgence. If it gets in the way of winning it's not worth it! Paul says that those who ran in the Isthmian Games did so to win 'a perishable wreath'.  He's on about those leafy crowns you see on the Olympics - and a whole lot more besides. The victors were treated like royalty. Often their debts were cancelled and they were allowed to live tax free for the rest of their lives. In some cases they were given a lifetime supply of food-the ultimate celebrity lifestyle. These athletes might be fixed up for life if they win, but according to Paul, it doesn't compare to the prize he's running for - a crown which lasts forever. So surely that eternal prize deserves just as much training and effort on the track of life! Look at what PauI says: 
'I don't know about you, but I'm running hard for the finish line. I'm giving it everything I've got. No sloppy living for me! I'm staying alert and in top condition. I'm not going to get caught napping, telling everyone else all about it and then missing out myself' (1 Corinthians 9:26-27 TM) 
So, are you running to win?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;BRING THE WHOLE TITHE INTO THE STOREHOUSE.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MALACHI 3:10 NAS</span><br>In the book of Malachi God hits His people with a serious question: '&quot;Will a man rob God?&quot;' (Malachi 3:8 NAS). The idea here is: 'Don't you realize Who you are stealing from? Do you think you can walk into My bank, rip Me off and not get picked up on CCTV?'  The people of Malachi's day played dumb and asked, &quot;How have we robbed You?&quot;' (v.8). God answered: '&quot;In tithes and offerings.&quot;' They were using the 10 percent that belonged to God for their own stuff. 
So what about you? What are you spending your cash on? It's easy for us to think that giving is only something that you need to think about when you've got a full time job and nice fat salary. The thing is, once we've got a job and salary it's easy to think that giving is what happens when we've paid the bills and gone shopping, and maybe been out a few times. We can all make excuses (just like the Jews in Malachi) saying that we need ALL our money. But check out what God says '&quot;Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse...test Me now in this,&quot; says the Lord of Hosts, &quot;if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows&quot;' (Malachi 3:10 NAS). What is God saying here? 'Trust me - you not going lose out, I've got you covered but you need to be giving!'  Be honest, does God get a look in when it comes to your wallet? Decide to be generous. Give your 10% and then some. Just see what happens!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WALK BY THE SPIRIT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:16 NAS</span><br>Fritz Ridenour, a Christian author, writes: 'You want to do right, but you do wrong. You want to choose obedience, but you choose sin. Sometimes you'd almost swear you were a split personality, a regular 'walking civil war'.' Sound familiar? Well you're not the only one! And most of us fight our civil war in the shadows, all alone. Satan whispers, 'Face it, you'll never be good enough. Why not just give up and accept the inevitable? You can't change.' But the fleshly desires that get us in to such a mess don't have to be in control. Paul writes, 'Walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.' Did you catch that? You see God's Spirit and our flesh are like oil and water. But when we're walking in the Spirit we don't listen to the desires of the flesh. So, we're listening to the Spirit and we're under His control, or we're listening to the flesh and we're under its control. And that's a choice we must make each day.
Even though you're a new creation the old stuff that tempted you before you met Jesus is still part of the world you live in. There will still be opportunities to make those cutting remarks you used to make. Things won't always go your way and you'll feel that old temper coming on, right? Lustful thoughts will still invade your mind. So, in the power of the Spirit you must throw up your hands and say, 'God, this stuff is trying to infect me. I can't beat it on my own!' It's at this point that He takes over and the battle goes your way!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...REGARD ONE ANOTHER AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURSELVES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:3 NAS</span><br>General Robert E Lee was one of the famous army officers in the American Civil War. One historian tells this story about him: 'After the civil war Lee received distinguished visitors from the north into his home in Lexington. Assuming that the Lees, like many prominent families in the north, had household servants, the guests, after retiring to bed, would leave their boots outside their bedroom door to be cleaned and 'blacked.' Many a night it was the old General himself who stayed up after the others retired, and - in order not to embarrass his guests - collected the boots, cleaned and polished them himself.' Paul writes, 'Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others' (Philippians 2:3-4 NAS). Paul points out that walking in humility means practicing three things: 
1) Sitting on the temptation to promote yourself. Trusting God to big you up, when He, not you, decides the time's right. 
2) Standing up for others. Like who? Think of the least liked person you know, or the one who's made a total mess of life. Stand up for them. Ask, 'How can I serve them?' Then do it - and keep doing it. 
3) Bowing low before God. 'I need God, He knows best. It's all down to Him'.  They are not things we say and mean easily!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THE WORK WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO DO.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 17:4 NAS</span><br>Doing a good thing isn't always the same as doing God's thing! When Jesus knew his time had come to end on the earth, though only 33 years old He could say: 'I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.' The thing is, Jesus could have got much more involved with the 12 disciples or maybe chosen 24 disciples to double His outreach. He could have travelled to Rome, the seat of power at the time. Or make his way to Athens, where He could touch great minds in order to extend His influence and reputation. But He chose only 12 disciples. He mentored them slowly and intimately, and never travelled far from the place of His birth. Some might say that if you're going to revolutionize the world you need to carry your cause to as many parts of it as possible. But Jesus deliberately kept it simple. At the end, just before breathing His last He said, 'It is finished.' Jesus was ready to die - because there was nothing left for Him to do. His work had been completed, from the training of the disciples to providing redemption for us. Jesus has done everything the father wanted - He'd kept to God's plan and knew it was job done. Mission accomplished! There are loads of good things you could be doing but are you doing what the Father has asked you? Why not make a list of all the stuff you're involved in now and all the possibilities on the horizon. Then get a highlighter pen and ask God to help you to pick out the top three things you should focus on?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THAT I MAY...BECOME MORE DEEPLY AND INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:10 AMP</span><br>Ella Wheeler Wilcox, a poet who lived over 100 year ago, wrote some famous words. OK, the language a bit old fashioned but check this out: 'One ship drives east and another drives west, with the selfsame winds that blow. 'Tis the set of the sails and not the gales, that decides the way to go...'Tis the set of the soul that decides its goal, and not the calm or the strife.' 
Have you noticed that the same difficult circumstance that knocks some off their feet, lifts another to incredible heights and makes them stronger? 'Tis the set of the sails and not the gales, which tells us the way to go.' Clearly, Paul had set his sails: 'That I may...become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him.' And he refused to compromise or be sidetracked. Intimacy with God was his all-consuming goal. Is such a goal reached easily? No! Spiritual disciplines (eg a change of attitude or a decision to be more prayerful or kind etc) must be worked at until they become long lasting habits. Your mind needs time and experience to get used to this selfless way of living- being selfless sadly doesn't come very naturally. And like any new model of behaviour these disciplines must be wrestled with However, with time, a few of them will begin to settle in and become your consistent lifestyle. Looking back, you'll discover you've actually changed. How? You set your sails in a new direction and you are no longer hopelessly blown by the winds of impulse, circumstance, people pleasing or self-interest. Christ-likeness is a journey, not a destination. So plan on a lifetime of travel.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A MAN REAPS WHAT HE SOWS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:7 NIV</span><br>Your mind is like a computer, it only spits out the data you feed it. IT boffins call this Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO). Dr Hans Selye researched and popularized a tiny membrane in the back of our head known as the RAS: Reticular Activating System. Your RAS has a primary function: it moves you in the direction of your dominant thought at that moment. We naturally act on what fills our minds. When we become preoccupied with a thought, eventually we want to act on it. This explains a lot of things - like why so many rapes happen after guys have watched pornography night after night. It also explains the huge amount of violence among young people between the ages of 12 and 24. By then the average young person has seen more than 4,000 murders on TV, not to mention video games. One medical school studied how the images we see impact our brains. For instance when studying teenagers with a high exposure to violence the researchers found that more violence they saw the less thinking, learning, reasoning and emotional stamina they had. The garbage they fed their minds affected what came out. Their computer stored the wrong information - now they could only retrieve the wrong stuff. The apostle Paul didn't know about computers. But he knew about agriculture: 'The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life' (Galatians 6:8 NIV). So think about what you think about!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...TRAIN YOURSELF TO BE GODLY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:7 NIV</span><br>So what does Paul mean when he tells Tim to be Godly? Give it a go, try asking your mates what they think 'godliness' means. Some might see a bald headed monk, praying, meditating and humming hymns behind stained-glass windows. Others see squeaky-clean, Bible-bashing do-gooders, who never do anything wrong and never have a laugh. Wrong! One scholar defines godliness this way: 'Not just outward worship, nor a mere concept of God, nor a virtue... True godliness that's born of faith covers everyday conduct in honouring God as Creator and Redeemer.' In other words, some well-meaning people seem to think that becoming like Christ means that we should strive to be perfect. For them, spiritual disciplines are like push-ups and sit-ups, religious exercises to beat their bodies and minds into submission. The thing is, if you just want to have control over your lusts or become more chilled and peaceful, any meditative religion will do. What sets Christianity apart from other religions is-knowing and becoming like Christ is our goal. Not moral perfection, although you will grow in character. Not tranquillity, although your life will become more peaceful. 
Because of the grace and undeserved love we have in Christ, doing the right thing will do nothing to make us more accepted by the Father, since Jesus has already done it all for us. No, a 'godly' person is one who stops being self-centred in order to become Jesus-centred. As we check out how Jesus walked and talked we see how God intended for us to live. Jesus is our perfect example of godliness. Therefore, being 'godly,' simply means becoming more like Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...TRAINING YOURSELF FOR SPIRITUAL FITNESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:7 NLT</span><br>When the coach of the American Football Team, Dallas Cowboys, was asked how to build a winning team he said: 'My job is to get men to do what they don't want to do, in order to achieve what they've always wanted to achieve.' What did those American football players want to achieve? To be the best team in the country and win the championship. What did they not want to do? The hard work necessary to get there! Achieving greatness requires discipline - determined, deliberate, daily, definable actions with a clear goal in mind. Paul coached Timothy, saying: 'Spend your time and energy in training yourself for spiritual fitness.' Timothy was the Pastor of the Church in Ephesus, a Las Vegas sort of city. It was a busy, rich, sensual place to be a Christian. Paul knew that succeeding there wouldn't be easy. In other words, becoming Christ-like requires a daily workout. So Paul writes, '...training yourself for spiritual fitness.' Notice two words in Paul instructions to his friend: 
1) Training - which calls for repetitive exercises so that your mind and appropriate muscle groups work together reflexively and automatically. It combines endurance and skill. It's what turns game-winning abilities into habits
2) Yourself - Nobody else can do it for you. Even 118-118 hasn't got you a number for: 'Hire-a-Dieter,' or 'Rent-a-Runner.' No, it's up to you!
So, why train yourself? To become like Jesus! By living life as He lived it, allowing the Holy Spirit to shape you from the inside out, you'll become more like Him. In other words, spend time each day in the gymnasium of the soul.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT IS GOD HIMSELF WHO HAS MADE US WHAT WE ARE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:10 TLB</span><br>A scientific researcher gathered 10 people together for an experiment in 'scars'. She used Hollywood style makeup and put horrible scars on each of the subjects faces. She then showed them their scar and put on a 'finishing powder' to seal it, which was actually a tissue she used to remove the scar. She then sent them back to their normal lives to see how people reacted. When they came back all of the 10 volunteers had the same report. They said people were more rude to them, less kind and stared at their 'scar'. 
As humans we get obsessed by our own flaws, whether that's physical or otherwise. We hate them and convince ourselves that everyone else finds them as repulsive as we do and treat us a certain way as a result. The reality is that most people probably haven't noticed and even if they have, aren't that bothered by it. Sometimes we can get so obsessed and consumed by our 'flaws' that we can treat other people with a defensive, bad attitude as though they disapprove of us, before they've even done anything! On the other hand, if we see ourselves the way God made us, this can help us have fantastic relationships! You can feel good about yourself and know that people genuinely love and care. A healthy self-image comes from knowing God loves us, that He made us and that He cares massively. Take some time today to listen to God, ask Him what He thinks, it may just change everything!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LET US NOT NEGLECT OUR MEETING TOGETHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 10:25 NLT</span><br>The church has to be the number one reason why Christians don't want to be Christians. How many times have you heard yout church mates complaining and winging about the church, the people, the worship, the youth group, the preaching, the preacher, the building, the weak tea.... The list goes on and on and on. And when the church winds us up, what do we do? We moan, we sulk, we find another church, or we just leave. 'I love God, I just can't stand church. ' WHAT?? It's totally understandable that we get wound up with church, it's run by people! People don't like change, we like our routines, our security, our comfort zone, we want to know what's going to happen. We worship a God that never changes but we seem to forget we're not God, we're SUPPOSED to be changing to be more like Him! 
The church, scarily enough, is God's answer. It doesn't really matter what the question is, the church is the way God created to answer it. So when we're fed up, frustrated, bored and want to quit, what do we do? We put in our all. We pray for our leaders, encourage our mates, turn up for meetings (even prayer meetings), tell the organist she was great today, play the part God has given you to play. A body would not be better off if the heart decided 'I don't like this body. I'm going to leave and beat alone'. It's the only way the church will ever 'improve'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THAT CHRIST MAY DWELL IN YOUR HEARTS THROUGH FAITH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:17 NAS</span><br>The word 'dwell' means more than just to move in and take up residence. It means to make yourself comfortable, to spread out and have the run of the house. When it comes right down to it, how many of us are willing to give Jesus complete control? The granddaddy of TV makeover shows was of course Changing Rooms. Before it hit the screens your bathroom had been safe from your mum's stencils as each week she watched friends and neighbours swop keys and get to work dumping furniture, repainting, and trying to make a bedroom look like a medieval castle. But 'Extreme Makeover-Home Edition' goes where BBC budgets have never been. In this American show, a family's house is often demolished and rebuilt it from the ground up. Meanwhile the family is sent on holiday whilst this takes place. When they return they find half the town and a brand new house waiting! Even the hardest of the hard might shed a small tear, as they watch these deserving families break down weeping with pure joy at what the makeover team have done! Now, if people can put their homes in the hands of a TV show surely we can allow Christ to come in and make Himself at home in our hearts. One thing's sure, we won't be unhappy with the results. When you give Jesus the keys to your heart He 'decorates' it with love, joy and peace, etc. He rewires it to tap you into the Holy Spirit's power. What could be better?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS GREW IN WISDOM AND STATURE, AND IN FAVOR WITH GOD AND MEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 2:52 NIV</span><br>Growing is something even Jesus did. One verse in the Bible picks up on four areas of growth: 1) He grew '...in wisdom...' - intellectual development 
2) He grew '...in stature...' - physical development 
3) He grew '...in favour with God...' - spiritual development
4) He grew '...in favour with men...' - social and emotional development 
Most of us tend to think that a mature Christian is someone who spends load of time praying and always listens during the sermons and never has to fold the notice sheet into a swan to stay awake! But being a Christian isn't just about what you do on Sunday. The effort you put in to learning stuff or keeping fit or being kind is all part of your growth into a mature Christian. So don't limit Jesus to some religious bit of your day or week, learn to include God when you banging one in the back of the net or free wheeling down a hill on your bike, when you are doing jigsaw puzzles with your nan or reading a book. This is what makes the Christian life dynamic, not static. But remember: we are each in different stages of our development. That's why comparison is a waste of time. Don't spend your life comparing yourself to other people, because you're not them. You are you!  Each day, ask GOD how you are doing with your wisdom, your stature and your favour with God and men. In some you'll show up well, in others you'll have a long way to go. Bottom line? You'll grow if you are thinking about growing, praying about growing and doing something about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;LORD, SHOW US THE FATHER, AND IT IS ENOUGH FOR US.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:8 NAS</span><br>You can't be a little bit pregnant. You may be in the early stages, but if you've life within you, eventually it'll become clear to everyone and the end result will be a child who's got your good looks and DNA. Philip said, '&quot;Lord, show us the Father.&quot;' Jesus answered, '&quot;Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father...&quot;' (John 14:9 NAS). Phil wasn't expecting that! Is it possible to be a Christian, yet not really know God in the way we claim to?
How can you know that the life of God is growing within you? Whenever you hear or read His Word, it'll echo deep in your soul. When you pray your spirit will pick up signals from God that answer your questions, correct your wanderings and satisfy your deepest longings. How quickly and solidly you grow depends on how hungry you are for growth. The formula for spiritual growth is simple: rate x time=distance. Sorry if you hate maths but this is what it means: The degree to which you use your time to pursue God will determine how quickly you arrive at your destination of maturity. That's why it's possible to be a Christian for five years, and be more spiritually advanced than those who've been saved for 25 years. Wherever you may be on your journey with Christ, the best place to start - is right where you are. You can't go back to yesterday or leap into tomorrow. But today is a brand new day. Use it to draw close to God!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE DISCERNING HEART SEEKS KNOWLEDGE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 15:14 NIV</span><br>Do you know that 50 percent of all college students stop reading books on their subject after graduation, even though a degree can become outdated in as little as five years? It might surprise you to know how little some people actually read, not because they can't, but because they can't be bothered. But like the saying goes, 'Leaders are readers.&quot; 
When Harry Ironside was a boy he heard about somebody who read the entire Bible every year. Impressed, he started reading and by age 14 he'd read through the Bible 14 times! As a result he became one of history's most influential preachers. His name is on over 100 books, mostly Bible commentaries. People were amazed by his knowledge of God's word and how he relayed it to them in simple everyday language. 
In prison Paul asked Timothy for 'the books, especially the parchments' (2 Timothy 4:13 NAS). The parchments were sacred scripture manuscripts. And the books were probably the ones he was reading when he was arrested. The Bible says, 'The discerning heart seeks knowledge.' So Paul was still reading the day he died! George Mueller, who was busier than most, said, 'I consider it a lost day when I haven't had a good time over the Word of God.' And J I Packer, a famous Christian author, said: 'A little knowledge of God is worth more than a great deal of knowledge about him.' God said, 'My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge' (Hosea 4:6). Just 15 minutes a day will take you through your entire Bible in less than a year. So, what's stopping you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>O LORD...WHO MAY DWELL ON YOUR HOLY HILL? HE WHO WALKS WITH INTEGRITY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 15:1-2 NAS</span><br>Chances are, you've seen grown men burning along on those mini motor bikes. But it never happens the other way round does it. You wouldn't give a five-year-old a big Harley-Davidson motorcycle! You need maturity to handle one of them (and a bushy beard helps too!). Giving that of kind gift to a kid would endanger them, and everybody else around them. The gifts just don't fit. Maybe you're really talented; God's given you a special gift like the ability to speak well, or organize things, or create and design. But when our gift becomes bigger than we are it can backfire big time. How does this happen? When we begin to lean on the talents God gave us and don't mature emotionally and spiritually. In this way we ruin our chance to use those talents as God designed them. When our character doesn't keep up with our talent, we learn to 'blag it' through life. We live on the surface but lack real strength underneath. And it shows up when the crisis hits, or we're under pressure. You can't 'blag it' when it comes to character building. The greater the size of your gifts, the more you must dedicate time to developing your character. The Message Bible puts it like this: 'God, who gets invited to dinner at your place? How do we get on your guest list? &quot;Walk straight, act right, tell the truth. Don't hurt your friend, don't blame your neighbour; despise the despicable. Keep your word even when it costs you, make an honest living, never take a bribe. You'll never get blacklisted if you live like this&quot;' (Psalm 15:1-5 TM). So, do you live that way?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 84:7 NIV</span><br>Programs like 'Super Nanny' and 'Brat Camp&quot; have become must-see shows for desperate parents looking to the experts for some answers. One issue the experts have identified is a problem called 'hurried child syndrome.' It's the tendency of parents in our fast paced society to rush their children into adulthood. We all have heard someone say 'just grow up' but experts say that some parents seem to expect too much too soon-not allowing children to enjoy their childhood. The Super Nanny would be the first to tell you that you can't skip the stages of childhood and produce healthy adults. Each stage is important.
The same is true of our spiritual growth. Spiritual birth, childhood, and adolescence are all necessary stages to our becoming mature. Although, unlike physical development, you can grow spiritually as fast as you want to-you have to work at it. The first tree to go down in the storm is the one with shallow roots. So don't just desire something because it looks good in somebody else's life. God tailors His blessings to your size. If you go a wedding or posh do try wearing a suit you haven't grown into, you would look a bit daft. Check this out: speaking of leaders, Paul writes, 'He must not be a new believer, lest the position go to his head and the devil trip him up' (1 Timothy 3:6 TM). God will give you all the blessing and responsibility you can handle - but not one bit more. And He'll do it based on your stage of growth. So, enjoy where you are on your way to where you're going!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>KEEP ME AS THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 17:8 NIV</span><br>A fourteenth century stained glass artist was asked to create a unique stained glass window in Chartres in France. He had thousands of pieces of beautifully coloured glass laying all over the floor - some colours that we can't even get today, and he carefully pieced them together to create a truly special piece of artwork. But, there was one bit he missed. A small piece of plain glass remained on the floor, alone. When it came to the grand unveiling, everyone was amazed, though after the gasps, the place fell silent as there was a feeling that something was just missing. The artist went over a picked up the small piece of glass, placed it into the window, right in the middle of Jesus' eye. The sunlight reflected off that little piece of glass with a dazzling sparkle. That beautiful window still draws visitors today, and the first thing they see is the sparkle in Jesus' eye. 
Sometimes we can feel like that little piece of glass, small, boring, plain, insignificant, left out, untalented, a disappointment. But to Jesus, we're the 'apple of his eye', the sparkle that completes the picture and shows it in it's true glory. God made you who you are, in his glorious image. He promises never to leave you, never to hurt you, never to mess you about or screw you over. When God looks over the earth, the sparkle in the beautiful landscape that catches his eye is you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I FEAR THAT...I MYSELF MIGHT BE DISQUALIFIED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 9:27 NLT</span><br>Do you remember the story of Samson? He wasn't a big muscly guy but he had a habit of not thinking things through, and he also got himself into dodgy relationships that eventually destroyed him. The Bible warns: 'Don't team up with those who are unbelievers. How can goodness be a partner with wickedness?...' (2 Corinthians 6:14 NLT). When God says 'no' to certain things He's not being difficult, He's being protective. Listen to Him, He knows what He's on about. Samson lived by his impulses! He thought he was in love but he was actually just letting his hormones do most of the thinking! When his folks disapproved Samson said, '...She is the one I want' (Judges 14:3 NLT). Before it was over he became a laughing stock. 
Peter writes: '...keep away from evil desires because they fight against your very souls' (1 Peter 2:11 NLT). In a battle the strongest side wins, so keep your impulses in check.  Don't be like Samson who misused his gift! You see Samson exploited his God-given strength for his own ambition and gain. He even used his gifts to make bets with his mates - see Judges 14:13. God gives us gifts to use for him, not for us. When we misuse them we end up in trouble. Samson was also clueless about weaknesses. Knowing your weaknesses and guarding against them is hugely important. Work out what they are, admit them, talk to people about them and stay accountable! Get people you trust to see how you're doing. It may just be what saves you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AS FAR AS THE EAST IS FROM THE WEST, SO FAR DOES HE REMOVE OUR TRANSGRESSIONS FROM US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 103:12 NIV</span><br>You know how it is, there is always someone (normally at Christmas) who you need a buy that little present for, something fun or silly and not too pricey. I expect that is why you can buy the 'wash away your sins soul-saver pak' from your local bookshop. For a mere £5.99 you get a little box with bubble bath 'for a sanctified soak', holy water 'dab on redemption for blessed relief' and guide book 'write your wrongs on 32 purified pages'. According to the box, it is cardinal approved, bishop tested, oh and the &quot;blessed buy the best&quot;!  January 1st, of course, is the one day of the year when most people are thinking about making a fresh start: with a clean slate and last year's mess ups behind them. Today you can make some resolutions, you can even have a &quot;sanctified soak&quot; with some gimmicky bubble bath but if you want to really be made clean and have new beginning then you need Jesus. When we 'fess up about our mess up, when we ask God to forgive us and give us new start, He loves it! Imagine that! Whatever last year was like, you can start this year, clean, pure and right with God. You just have to ask and be up for living a new way.  Check out 1 John 1:8 if we say we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and refusing to accept the truth. But if we confess our sins to Him, He is faithful and just, quick to forgive us and to cleanse us from every wrong.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEN I REMEMBERED WHAT THE LORD HAD SAID...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 11:16 NIV</span><br>Well, it's the last day of 2006, and it's a great time to remember who Jesus is and all God has done for us, and to be thankful for it.  
1) He created us: 'Everything was created by Him, everything in heaven and on earth, everything seen and unseen, including all forces and powers, and all rulers and authorities. All things were created by God's Son, and everything was made for him.' (Colossians 1:16 CEV)
2) He has given us new life: 'You were dead, because you were sinful and were not God's people. But God let Christ make you alive, when he forgave all our sins.' (Colossians 2:13 CEV)
3) He has kept us safe and secure: 'The LORD is my light and my salvation - so why should I be afraid? The LORD protects me from danger - so why should I tremble?  When evil people come to destroy me, when my enemies and foes attack me, they will stumble and fall. Though a mighty army surrounds me, my heart will know no fear. Even if they attack me, I remain confident.' Psalm 27:1-3 NLT
4) Because He is God: 'And do not forget the things I have done throughout history. For I am God--I alone! I am God, and there is no one else like me. Only I can tell you what is going to happen even before it happens. Everything I plan will come to pass, for I do whatever I wish.' Isaiah 46:9-10 NLT
Doesn't that make you feel excited at the prospect of starting a new year with God on your side!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD IS WORKING IN YOU GIVING YOU THE DESIRE TO OBEY HIM AND THE POWER TO DO WHAT PLEASES HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:13 NLT</span><br>A man trying to win a woman will do anything for her. She'll call him and say, 'I know it's late, you're tired and it's raining, but could you come over and change my flat tyre?' 'Sure, I'll be right over,' he says. And over he comes with a smile. Now, fast forward. They've been married 10 years; he's at home with this same woman whom he once chased around everywhere like a puppy. She asks him to get up off the sofa and do something for her. She has to say it three or four times, - you'd think she'd asked him to cut off his leg the way he moans and groans! Then she gets upset. What's happening? What was once a pleasure has become a pain - because the love has cooled off! 
Our problem isn't really obedience, it's keeping our love for Christ strong.  Only love makes obedience a joy. Less obedience quite simply means less love. Lots of people allow the love to fizzle out of the Christian life, so that it just becomes a set of rules.  But God has designed the Christian life around relationships, not rules. Rules without relationship lead to coldness. Jesus sent an angel to the Christians at Ephesus to say: 'I have this against you, that you have left your first love' (Revelation 2:4 NAS). In other words, 'You don't love Me like you used to.' Then He commanded them to return to the point where they had fallen, which is where they let their love for Him slip. Is Christ saying the same thing to you today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD IS WORKING IN YOU GIVING YOU THE DESIRE TO OBEY HIM AND THE POWER TO DO WHAT PLEASES HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:13 NLT</span><br>Jesus said, 'My yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light' (Matthew 11:30 NLT). Lots of those who heard these words were farmers who used oxen to plough their fields.  They understood what Jesus was saying because the yoke was one of their most important bits of equipment.  It was a wooden attachment that fitted between two oxen so that their full pulling power could be released.  They wouldn't dream of putting an ill-fitting yoke on their oxen that caused them to chafe, or pull the plough in a wonky line.  Now, when you hear Jesus using these kinds of illustrations you mustn't go too far in examining them - Jesus doesn't think his followers are cows and don't get take the 'pulling power' phrase literally!  This illustration is about Jesus having a role for you in life which suits your personality just right.  He's saying that there's a job for you to do, which will take some effort - but it's a job you were built for and will ultimately excel at.  
So why do so many of us not feel an instant desire to get out there and get on with it?  Quite simply because we've spent so long not being the person we were made to be, and not doing the things we were made to do, that the 'yoke' feels totally weird at first.  The only way to make it feel less weird is just to get started and get into the groove!  In no time you'll be asking yourself 'Why didn't I get started sooner?'  Obedience isn't hard work, it's what you were made for!

Most of us don't connect obedience with pleasure. We're used to obeying out of fear. Perhaps we had parents who made us obey 'just because I said so.' Now it's not wrong for parents to expect obedience from children, or teachers to expect cooperation from their class. But it's not the best definition or the highest motivation for obedience. The element that's missing is the 'want to' factor that God built into each of us at the point of salvation. This takes the 'ought to/have to/better do it or else God will zap you' element out of it! It elevates obeying God to a level of an excited response because of all that He's done for you. Obedience is not something you have to manufacture it just needs to be activated because the desire is already present in you - it just needs to be activated.  This will often come during a time of worship, prayer, or listening to a preacher.  Nobody wants their relationship with God to be like the boy who misbehaved and was told by his mother to go and sit in the corner. After a few minutes she called to him from the other room, 'Are you still sitting down?' He replied, 'Yes, I'm sitting down on the outside, but I'm standing up on the inside.' You could call that obedience, but actually it's rebellion.  Real obedience is gladly doing on the outside, what you really want to do on the inside.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T BECOME SO WELL-ADJUSTED TO YOUR CULTURE THAT YOU FIT INTO IT WITHOUT EVEN THINKING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:2 TM</span><br>Don't be a thermometer, be a thermostat. Thermometers just display the temperature around them - thermostats set it. Most of us are like thermometers reflecting the culture around us. We buy things other people buy, say things other people say, wear things other people wear, and value things other people value. Oh, we might occasionally take a risk, but most of the time we don't set the climate for the world we live in; we simply adjust to it. But not real, radical disciples! No, they take life to the next level. They become thermostats and change the environment they're placed in. Maybe you know someone like that, who raises the spiritual temperature of a group, who affects the attitudes of other people just by being present. They're pacesetters, revolutionaries... they are the influence, rather than allowing others to influence them. Paul challenged the Romans to do this.  Listen: 'Don't become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you' (Romans 12:2 TM). Is that the kind of person you want to be? I hope so, because God calls us to be authentic. If something is authentic it is real, not fake, an original, the genuine article.  That's living. That's being a thermostat, not a thermometer! Why would you want to live life any other way?

<title><![CDATA[7 Deadly Social Sins]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AND A HIGHWAY WILL BE THERE; IT WILL BE CALLED THE WAY OF HOLINESS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 35:8 NIV </span><br>Mahatma Gandhi was an Indian man, who was born in the late 19th century, who lived a pretty hectic life until he was assassinated in 1948. He is famous for being an incredible campaigner for freedom and justice. He travelled a lot and, considering he had none of the usual characteristics of popularity - looks, wealth, or an impressive personality, he was incredibly influential. He said and achieved some amazing things, and his voice still echoes around the world. Sadly Ghandi never accepted Christ, in fact He once said, 'I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.' What a shame that someone clearly switched on to Jesus was switched off by the way he saw Christians living their lives. 
Today is Boxing Day, which is usually a pretty chilled out day after all the madness of Christmas Day. So let's use it to do some thinking about the world we live in, and how we choose to live that life.  Ghandi wrote a little list which can help us to do this; he called it the 7 Deadly Social Sins:
1) Politics without principle. Those trusted with responsibility need total integrity.  
2) Wealth without work. Being rich is no excuse to be lazy. 
3) Commerce without morality. We need to spend money wisely.  
4) Pleasure without conscience. 'Its not hurting anyone' is usually a lie. 
5) Education without character. On its own knowledge is useless.
6) Science without humanity. We do not have the right to play God. 
7) Worship without sacrifice. True faith is expensive. 
Is the Holy Spirit impressing any of those points onto your heart right now?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IN THESE LAST DAYS HE HAS SPOKEN TO US BY HIS SON</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 1:2 NIV</span><br>Imagine you're a stalker. You follow the object of your obsession around everywhere. It doesn't take you long to become familiar with the general pattern of their life - out at 8.30, back again by 4.30. Hangs around with mates in the shopping centre at weekends. Then you get really clever and fix secret webcams in their house. You start to get to know all the little habits, singing into the mirror, pigging out on chocolate ice cream late at night. In your freaky stalker way you really feel like you know this person now, you are friends...... No you aren't, you creep! How could you possibly claim to know this person just based on these observations? Getting to know someone involves personal exchange. Only when someone chooses to share their personality with you can you claim to be getting to know them. And this is what Christmas Day is all about, it's God saying 'I want to be known by you.'  Right up until the birth of Jesus people couldn't know God personally, they could only observe the things he did from a distance. They formed some opinions and assumptions about him, he must be creative, powerful, and infinitely wise. But ordinary people could never really know what moves his heart.
Paul says, 'The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being...' (Hebrews 1:3 NIV). This means that the birth of Jesus was literally an explosion of personal expression straight from God. And every second of His unique life was a syllable in an amazing divine conversation that opened our understanding to the true character of the creator behind the creation.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHAT IS CONCEIVED IN HER IS FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 1:20 NIV</span><br>You must learn to recognize seed-sized blessings. Why? Because until they start to grow it may not be clear to other people (or even you) that God is with you. Look at Mary: 'In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth...to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph...The virgin's name was Mary. The angel...said, &quot;Greetings, you who are highly favoured! The Lord is with you.&quot; Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favour with God. You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.&quot;... &quot;How will this be,' Mary asked the angel, 'since I am a virgin?' The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you...So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God...For nothing is impossible with God.&quot; &quot;I am the Lord's servant,' Mary answered. 'May it be to me as you have said...&quot;' (Luke 1:26-38 NIV).
Mary's pregnancy, and her parenting of Jesus teaches us lots of important lessons: a) she was capable of conceiving what God wanted b) she could trust God with her unanswered questions c) she could carry it full-term d) she could deliver it in health e) when the time came she could release it to fulfil God's plan, even though it meant the breaking of her heart. So this Christmas, amongst all your big, brightly packaged presents, ask God to help you recognize your seed-sized blessings.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS MOST GENEROUS GOD...GIVES YOU SOMETHING YOU CAN THEN GIVE AWAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:10-11 TM</span><br>The thing you want to reap, must be the thing that you plant. Why? Because the seeds you plant will reproduce after their own kind, whether for good or for bad. '...You will always reap what you sow' (Galatians 6:7 NLT). You see, you don't necessarily reap when you sow or where you sow, but you always reap what you sow. Some of us think we can plant weeds and get roses. We shake our heads and wonder why God isn't blessing us with a harvest, forgetting that we haven't sown the right seed in the first place. For instance, we can be quick to judge others, yet we ourselves are the first to expect grace and understanding when we mess up. Sorry, you're not going to get any grace from other people until you start sharing some out yourself!
And there's one more principle of sowing and reaping we need to understand. We not only reap what we sow, we always reap more. 'For God, who gives seed to the farmer to plant, and later on, good crops to harvest and eat, will give you more and more seed to plant and will make it grow so that you can give away more and more fruit from your harvest. Yes, God will give you much so that you can give away much...' (2 Corinthians 9:10-11 TLB). Some people live by the saying 'get all you can, can all you get, then sit on the can.' But why would you want to do that when God has offered you something much better - the chance to be blessed so much that it overflows all around you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHOEVER SOWS GENEROUSLY WILL ALSO REAP GENEROUSLY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:6 NIV</span><br>You'll never see a farmer who refuses to plant seeds, sitting around expecting a harvest. He's not going to get many cabbages out of the soil if he never planted the cabbage seed in the first place! That's because the law of sowing and reaping is built into creation. '&quot;As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest...will never cease&quot;' (Genesis 8:22 NIV). 
And this isn't just a principle that works for farmers. It extends to every area of life. God has created life to function around seeds not needs. Some of us approach God from a need standpoint, 'I can't give anything to your kingdom today God, because I have to pay these bills.' That's like a farmer saying, 'I can't plant this seed even though it'll yield a good crop, because I'm hungry right now, so I'm gonna throw it in the pot and have it for my tea!' This is where your faith kicks in. When a farmer plants his seed it's an act of faith that his seed will turn into a harvest. He won't get his harvest right away. He has to wait for the right season. But he's putting his faith in an unfailing law that God's placed in the universe, the law of sowing and reaping. Are you getting the idea? When you give, you're demonstrating faith in God's Word. When He tells you to sow generously so that you can reap generously, are you going to trust Him? The way you handle this simple principle says a lot about the practical dimension of God's Word working in your life. Are you a doer of the Word or just a hearer?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I WILL LIVE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOR EVER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:6 NLT</span><br>You're not home yet, the Bible is clear that the life we currently live is just the warm up for something far more spectacular! So what does that make your present house? Temporary accommodation. 'Our homeland is in heaven...' (Philippians 3:20 NCV). If you haven't realized it already you will eventually, because the twists and turns of life have a way of teaching us - this world is not our home. We aren't fluent in its language and we aren't comfortable in its culture. This world promises a lot but only delivers a little. But that's okay - we have an eternal address written on our hearts: '[God] has...set eternity in the hearts of men...' (Ecclesiastes 3:11 NIV). But even though our eyes are fixed on heaven, the journey ahead of us is likely to be long, and there will be storms. Some of our dreams may well die along the way. Our bodies will eventually get weak and creaky. We'll see friends trip and fall on our right and our left. And there will be days when it's hard to see the city of blinding lights because of the thick black rain clouds. Yes, we want to go on, but some days the road seems too steep. So always, always, always remember this: God never said the journey would be easy, but He did say the arrival would be wonderful. So have faith in Him and in His amazing promises to you. Imagine that amazing feeling when the trials of the trip are forgotten in the joys of your heavenly welcome!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SURELY YOUR GOODNESS AND UNFAILING LOVE WILL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:6 NIV</span><br>Goodness and unfailing love. God wants to do us good, we know that, but this is even better: because we all fail, we need to know that God's love never will. His feelings towards us are of passionate affection. And if that doesn't impress you, try this phrase: 'all the days of my life.' Think of the days that could lie ahead of you: getting married and keeping together, having kids and trying to raise them well, times of ill health and times of financial need. Listen: 'Goodness and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life.' All of them!
And what will the Shepherd do during those days? He will pursue you. What a surprising way to describe God. We've got a funny picture of a God who lives in a distant place; who sits enthroned in the heavens and pushes buttons. But no, like a Shepherd who walks behind, gently coaxing His sheep forward, our Lord is always close to us. He tracks us down and wins us over. Have you sensed Him pursuing you? So often we miss Him; we don't know our Helper when He's near. Yet He's always there. Sometimes he might show himself through the kindness of a stranger; through the question of a child or the commitment of a loved one. And even when we wander this way and that, seemingly deaf to his voice, He still pursues. Never forcing us but never leaving us. He just keeps on walking and talking, convincing us that He is who He is, and that He can be trusted to lead us home. What more could we ask for?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:4 NKJ</span><br>Springtime grazing leaves the pasture bare. So, the shepherd leads his flock to richer grass, beyond the hills and into the mountains. Valleys are dark and deep. Jagged rocks can cut. Wild animals can attack. But the shepherd knows the path because he's walked it many times.
Before King David led Israel, he led sheep. So he writes: '...though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me...' And what the shepherd does with his flock, God does with us. In every season of life we can trust God to lead us. And as each day fades into night we're getting closer to His house where we'll feel more at home than anywhere we've ever been. Jesus spoke about it in John, Chapter 14. The disciples didn't know it was His farewell message. No one did - but it was. He spoke about death: 'Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust in me. There are many rooms in my Father's house; I would not tell you this if it were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you. After I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I am' (John 14:1-3 NCV). What an arrangement, you have a personal guide through every stage of your earthly life, then your own suite in the best hotel in the universe!  With Jesus as your Shepherd, you really do get the best of both worlds!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:1</span><br>Jesus said, '&quot;Suppose one of you had a hundred sheep and lost one. Wouldn't you leave the ninety nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until you found it?&quot;' (Luke 15:4 TM). Can you recall when you were that one lost sheep? Do you remember when Jesus found you?  Where would you be without Him? 
Eighty percent of Jesus' listeners made their living off the land. Many were shepherds living in the countryside with their sheep. No flock ever grazed without a shepherd and no shepherd was ever off duty. When the sheep wandered, the shepherd found them. When they fell, he picked them up and carried them. When they were wounded, he fixed them up. Sheep aren't clever; they tend to stray into running creeks for water, then their wool gets wet and they can drown. They need a shepherd to lead them to '...still waters' (Psalm 23:2 KJV). They have no natural defence - no claws or sharp teeth. They need a shepherd with a big stick to protect them from predators (Psalm 23:4). They have no sense of direction. They need someone who knows the way to lead them '...On paths that are right...' (Psalm 23:3 NCV). So do we. We tend to get swept away in we should have avoided. We have no natural defence against our enemy who goes about as a '...roaring lion, seeking someone to devour' (1 Peter 5:8 NAS). And finally, we lose our way, don't we? No doubt about it, we need a shepherd. Not a cowboy to herd us, a true shepherd to lead us - and aren't you glad we have one looking out for us every minute of every day.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DISCIPLINE YOURSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF GODLINESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:7 NAS</span><br>Disciplined people don't need cheering crowds to feed their hunger for excellence. Jascha Heifetz, perhaps the greatest violinist of the 20th century, practiced four hours every day, until his death at 87 years of age. That's more than 100,000 hours of practice, interrupted by occasional public performances! The great painter, Leonardo da Vinci, desired nothing less than anatomical perfection for his paintings. He spent countless hours studying the human body. For one painting he became so frustrated by his inability to paint the body as he wished that he drew thousands of hands until he felt it was just right. Centuries later we gaze in awe at his work but don't see the hours of preparation. We're not aware of the patient training of da Vinci's hand, eye and mind for the sake of those magnificent images. It's easy to forget that it's the discipline we didn't see, that made our most gifted musicians and artists the best at what they did. 
And what's true of them is also true for Christ-like people. If there's a person you respect because of their spirituality, you can be certain that person has practiced certain disciplines and rhythms. They weren't born that way. The life you respect and wish for yourself didn't automatically come with age, or a promotion to some position. No! They paid the cost for their spiritual depth - hours of trying, failing, and trying again; suffering through hardship; learning to rely on God, surrendering again and again Holy Spirit because they found life works better that way. This is why Paul encouraged Timothy, 'Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;FEED THE HUNGRY! HELP THOSE IN TROUBLE!&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 58:10 TLB</span><br>'Don't get sidetracked by the pain or problems of others. After all, it's probably their own fault. They got themselves into the mess. They just need to find Jesus and the problem will solve itself. Anyway, I don't know anyone who's 'hungry' to feed and all my mates have clothes.' Who thinks like that? Sadly, some peeps who actually call themselves Christians! What happened to being committed and compassionate? Jesus wouldn't give an inch when it came to the truth, but watch Him around hurting people. He was '...moved with compassion...' (Matthew 9:36 KJV). Unfortunately, loads of us only moved with disgust - 'dirty tramp, he should just get a job'. But then that's easier, isn't it? That way we don't have to get our hands dirty, take risks, feel what it's like to hurt, or deal with the difficult side of an issue that has no easy answers. 
Many years ago God had a conversation with a very religious bunch of people. These people asked God, '&quot;...Why don't you see our sacrifices? Why don't you hear our prayers?&quot;' (Isaiah 58:3 TLB). God's answer should make us sit up and do some real soul-searching. He said, 'Feed the hungry! Help those in trouble! Then (and only then) the Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy you with all good things, and keep you healthy too.' Guidance. Security. Satisfaction. Health. And there's more! Jesus said that we'll all be evaluated and rewarded according to how we treat hurting people (see Matthew 25:34-40; Colossians 3:12-14; James 5:11). So ask yourself today: 'How do I treat them?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S, AND EVERYTHING IN IT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 24:1 NIV</span><br>Your attitude towards giving is like one of the warning lights on a car's dashboard. When one of those lights comes on, something under the bonnet needs attention before there's a breakdown. In the same way when God flashes on the indicator light of money and giving in your life, it's not because He's short of cash. No, He's pointing out something in your heart that you can't afford to ignore. And He wants to deal with it. 
You see, for as long as there have been Christians there have been stingy Christians! The book of Acts tells us a story about a married couple named Ananias and Sapphira who got greedy with the profit of their property sale, with some really heavy consequences (e.g. they ended up dead, see Acts 5:1-11). This is a pretty extreme example but that doesn't mean we can just ignore it. A stingy attitude doesn't just include sudden paralysis and inability to reach for your purse or wallet at offering time. It also means never offering to buy the coffees in Starbucks, or having a reputation for being the person who will never even offer you one of their chips! The attitude is basically selfish, 'This is mine and it's not for sharing'. So what's the answer? Well the best place to start is by realizing that you are a manager - not an owner. You're simply looking after what belongs to God, a job which is often more about distribution than warehousing! So when God asks you to give, regardless of how much, remember, He's just asking for what He already owns.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHAT IS MORTAL MAY BE SWALLOWED UP BY LIFE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 5:4</span><br>One of the most difficult bits of the Bible to understand is the end of it. The book of Revelation is full of coded images whose meaning a lot of people fall out about. But there are two things that we can be certain of - Jesus is coming back, and He wins! 
So what might it be like at the end of the wolrd? Well this is where we can get a little bit of help from The Simpsons! There's an episode in which Homer accidentally transports himself to the 'Third Dimension'. One minute he's an ordinary 2 dimensional cartoon, the next he's a 3 dimensional CGI character - like Buzz Lightyear. He's really freaked out when he looks down at his belly and sees that it bulges so much! So what's this got to do with the end of the world as we know it? Well, think of what would happen if heaven crashed into earth (see Ephesians 1:9-10, Revelation 1:2-3). The thing about heaven is that it is eternal - it has more dimensions than earth. Got that? OK, now imagine earth is Homer, in 2D, but Heaven is in 3D, (no wonder the prophets in the Bible who had heavenly visions struggled to explain them, like Homer struggles to cope with being transformed from 2D to 3D) the result would be the most massive event ever, it would affect everything and everyone. 
Now, this is just an exercise in imagination, but the Bible does give us more clues about what this ultimate event will be like.  It does say, '...what is mortal may be swallowed up by life' (2 Corinthians 5:4 NIV) - and whatever that really means it sounds exciting!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TRUST IN THE LORD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:5 NIV</span><br>Have you ever tried to hold on to something really wriggly - like a hyperactive hamster?  Or something slippery - like a frightened frog?  It's practically impossible!  So why do you think you can keep the people or circumstances of your life tightly in your grip?  LET GO!  Really, go ahead: surrender it to God. You'll be amazed at how much more energy you'll have, and how much simpler life will be. Once you make the choice to surrender it to God, those difficult days will soon seem like a distant memory.  A Bible boffin called Tozer once wrote: 'Father, my cowardly heart fears to give up its toys. I cannot part with them without inward bleeding, and I do not try to hide from you my terror of the parting. I come trembling, but I do come. Please root from my heart those things which I have cherished so long and which have become a very part of my living self, so that you may enter and dwell there without a rival.' So, you say, 'Surrender what?' 
1) Your Rep! What good is street cred compared to God cred? Find your security and your identity in Him. 
2) Your plans! Sure, think ahead, but be ready for God to rearrange things and take you along a new path. Nothing this side of Heaven is permanent, including relationships. Enjoy the time you have with your mates and your loved ones, but avoid the temptation to get clingy. 
3) Your stuff! If your attention is occupied with the stuff you own, your clothes, gadgets, exotic butterfly collection - whatever - you aren't fully available for God. No, you're still clinging to minor things. Stop. Let go! You're cluttering the awesome life God has made possible for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...FROM THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH MUCH, MUCH MORE WILL BE ASKED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 12:48 NIV</span><br>As you read the Bible more and more, you'll begin to realize that God looks for people that He can trust with responsibility. The people who have been used by God in amazing ways are not just dreamers, they are doers. They are not those who play it safe, but those who get off the fence and get the job done - whatever the cost. Sometimes the decision to do nothing is wise, but you can't live your whole life like that!  Don't be paralysed by the need to weigh everything too carefully. Don't make your catchphrase, 'On the one hand...but then again on the other.' There's an old saying about five frogs on a log.  It's a hot day and four of them decide to jump off, into the cool water of the pond below.  So how many frogs are left on the log?  Five.  Even though they reached a decision, they still couldn't be bothered to actually follow through with it.  Make sure you keep working on trimming down that delay between deciding and doing. 
Finding and fulfilling God's destiny for your life means making decisions - tough decisions, lonely decisions, costly decisions, unpopular decisions, unpleasant decisions, and courageous decisions. It also means the end of excuse making: '...from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.' You say you don't like how things are going in your life. Really? What are you going to do about it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND BE WHAT WE WERE MADE TO BE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:6 TM</span><br>Fifty years ago The Golden Buddha was discovered in the city of Bangkok, Thailand. For years a huge, ugly, concrete Buddha had sat in a scruffy temple in a poor part of town.  Then a wealthy developer bought the land on which the temple was built - the five ton statue had to be moved.  In the process it cracked. As the pieces crumbled the engineers noticed something underneath the concrete shell, something shiny and metallic. They pulled the shell away and inside they found the world's largest chunk of sculptured gold, standing 10 feet high. For hundreds of years it had been there - but no one knew it. And you are a lot like that statue. Your real value is inside, if only you'd break out of that hard shell you're hiding in to protect yourself.  Do you know that the things you achieve in your life flow out of the way you see yourself.  If you think you're average, you'll perform in an average way. Once in a while you may have a great day and be really excellent. You might even think, 'That was awesome, I really outdid myself!' However, unless deep down you start believing in your God-given gifts, value and potential, you'll retreat to your old level of living because you think: 'That's not the real me.' That's just sad.  Let's end today being inspired by the words of Paul; 'Since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellently formed and marvellously functioning parts in Christ's body, let's just go ahead and be what we were made to be, without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other, or trying to be something we aren't' (Romans 12:5-6 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD INTENDED IT FOR GOOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 50:20 NIV</span><br>Have you ever been to a real pizzeria? Not the kind of place where everything is pre-packaged. No, the kind of place where they take a ball of dough, slam it down, twirl it around and flatten it. Only then do they think about putting all that good stuff on top. Think of yourself as pizza dough and God as the person working it. He's got some good stuff He wants to lay on you, but before He can do it He's got to knock you into shape.
Take Joseph as an example.  What happened to him wasn't fair! When your own family sells you as a slave and the new boss' wife has you banged up for sexual harassment, you've got a right to ask: 'God, what's going on?' Before God promoted Joseph to the palace he wanted to know how he'd hold up under pressure. And the same goes for you. Joseph was called to save his family and lead his nation. But big jobs call for big tests of character. Sadly, you don't always understand this when you're going through test though. Try to take this on board today though - in the end, it's worth it.  When Joseph's brothers finally met him as ruler of Egypt he told them 'As far as I am concerned, God turned into good what you meant for evil. He brought me to the high position I have today so I could save the lives of many people' (See Genesis 50:20-21). Talk about seeing things clearly! Joseph's story shows us that someone else's action against you is not the end.   God knows that somewhere down the line He'll be able to use all that painful stuff to bring your life into focus and make you a better person.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;HOW MANY LOAVES DO YOU HAVE?&quot; HE ASKED. &quot;GO AND SEE...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 6:38 NIV</span><br>Being a Christian is often about finding the extraordinary, within the ordinary. Opportunities for growth and blessing are constantly coming your way; how many do you let pass by unnoticed?  How often do you stop and pray: 'Father, show me what I'm not seeing. Your Word says You can turn a curse into a blessing. If I can't change this right now, how can I use it to grow wiser and do better next time? Have You permitted this problem because You have the solution, but You want me to reach for You more passionately before You reveal it to me?' 
Before Jesus fed the five thousand He told His disciples (who'd decided to send the crowd away to find their own food), '...You give them something to eat' (Luke 9:13 NIV). They replied, '...That would take eight months of a man's wages!...' (Mark 6:37 NIV). That's when Jesus asked, '&quot;How many loaves do you have?...Go and see...&quot;' (Mark 6:38 NIV). They wanted to send the problem away - to take the easy way out. He challenges them to look for the extraordinary, in the ordinary. When you do that you recognize that God isn't sat on a cushion a million miles away having a pedicure.  No, God is present and active in the world by his Holy Spirit, moving and motivating people.  The key to this miracle was that God wasn't confined to the ministry of Jesus, he was moving on the heart of a young boy, stirring him to donate his lunch.  When you've finished crying out to God in heaven, look around you.  You'll probably find he's already prepared His answer, and its waiting for you here on earth.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAY CONTINUALLY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:17 NCV</span><br>Prayer is truly amazing; it's like having a hands-free kit to God!  You might feel like your parents, teachers and brothers and sisters don't listen to you, but when you pray, God listens.  It's the greatest privilege imaginable - a hotline to the control centre of the Universe - and its not a premium rate number - it's free! The Bible is full of people of prayer.  When the people of Israel dissed God by worshipping a golden calf, Moses prayed and saved them from the destruction God had every right to bring on them.  One translation of Exodus 32.11 says, 'Moses soothed the face of his God'.  Through the prophet Ezekiel, God described the sort of prayer warrior he's looking for: 'I sought for a man among them who would...stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one' (Ezekiel 22:30 NLT). Let's not let that be the story of this generation! 
You might wonder why God puts such importance on prayer?  The simple answer is that God loves being in a friendship with us.  It's almost as if our passion stirs up his passion.  If our prayers don't move us how can we expect them to move him?  Also, remember that prayer isn't just a private thing - it's great to pray with your mates.
Listen: 'When two of you get together on anything...and make a prayer of it, My Father in heaven goes into action' (Matthew 18:19 TM). Does any other activity promise such results? Get texting your friends straight away - it's time to pray!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I PRESS ON TOWARD THE GOAL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:14 NIV</span><br>People who drive forward progress in the world are often called an 'agent of change'.  If you want to become an agent of change, first of all you yourself must change!  And it isn't to do with your intelligence, your looks or your family background; it's all about your attitude.  You have an advantage today, because you're young and young people cope much better with change than people who are getting on a bit.  Young people are excellent learners and are still full of creativity. 'The system' hasn't crushed all your good ideas yet; and you must make sure you never let it!  So what can you see in the world around you that needs to change?  Is bullying a problem at your school?  Can you start a campaign to stop it?  Are people in your college ignorant about trade justice?  Can you get them to shop fair trade?  An agent for change looks at the world around, sees how it could be better, then does something about it.  It's the best way to live your life and the sooner you start, the more you'll achieve in your lifetime.  The apostle Paul was an awesome agent of change.  Near the end of his life, he wrote: '...Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me...' (Philippians 3:13-14 NIV). Paul learned from his past, but he refused to live in it. You can just imagine him waking up every day and thinking to himself, 'It's a new day full of possibilities; Lord help me to max every moment!' What would life be like if you got out of bed with that kind of attitude?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY ARE LIKE TREES PLANTED ALONG THE RIVERBANK...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 1:3 NLT</span><br>When you start passing on what you've learnt to other people you'll find that your own development speeds up too. You start understanding things more deeply. You see, the truth doesn't change, but your understanding of it should.
Howard Hendricks writes; 'When I was a college student ...I worked in the dining hall.  On my way to work at 5.30 each morning I walked past the home of one of my professors.  Through a window I could see a light on at his desk. He was pouring over his books. One day he invited me home for lunch and I said: &quot;Would you mind if I asked you a question? What keeps you studying? You never seem to stop.&quot; He answered &quot;Son, I would rather have my students drink from a running stream than a stagnant pool.&quot;'
Do you want to be a teacher? Then make sure you are always in the flow of the freshest ideas available. The Bible says, 'they are like trees planted along the riverbank.' It's a poetic picture of what it's like to be a person who is close to God and soaked in His Word. If you want to teach others you must first ask God to teach you. 
Peter writes: '...grow in ...grace and knowledge...' (2 Peter 3:18 NIV). This requires the attitude that you haven't yet 'arrived.'
Being a teacher doesn't mean you are a know-it-all. It doesn't mean you have to be able to answer every difficult question.  It just means you are willing to pass on what you have learned yourself. So, if you want to strengthen your teaching, do everything in your power to strengthen the teacher - you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU, HOWEVER, KNOW ALL ABOUT MY TEACHING, MY WAY OF LIFE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 3:10 NIV</span><br>Teachers don't have it easy! Every day they're dealing with young people who are up one minute and down the next. Their day starts early and their schedule is packed. So would you want to be a teacher? Well you can be - but maybe not at the front of a classroom.  Anybody who helps other people to learn about something is a teacher.
Now, a teacher isn't a teacher without students.  The relationship between teachers and their pupils is really important. If the relationship is tense or awkward nobody is going to learn very much. So, if you think you have a talent to teach, know your students. That takes commitment and time.  Good teaching has a price tag: you've got to be willing to give out your energy for others. It's cheesy but true. People don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care. 
Next, you need to earn the right to be heard. Credibility must precede communication. In our celebrity society everything is fake.  People want to know if you are for real. That will mean being willing to become vulnerable. It's the broken who become masters at mending. Don't be afraid to let people know what you're struggling with, and what you've struggled with through the years. It will help you no end if people begin to get a grip of who you are in terms of who you are now, in relation to where you come from and what you've been through. And never be afraid to talk about the God you know personally, and what He's done for you. That'll make an impact every time!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...A TIME IS COMING AND HAS NOW COME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 4:23 NIV</span><br>Phase one: Hopeless. This woman had lived through five failed marriages, become the embarrassment of the town, and lost her ability to trust others or respect herself. Then Jesus showed up. As soon as Jesus spoke to her she knew that this was no ordinary conversation - no ordinary man. His words began giving her a glimpse into another world, the kind of world she'd given up believing in years before. Jesus was describing a world in which relationships are restored, religious divisions are ended and satisfaction is deep and lasting. And when Jesus mentioned this woman's past He wasn't pointing an accusing finger. No, He was the Good Shepherd walking for miles to find one lost sheep. Like a caring nurse He poured healing love into her deepest wounds. He opened a door out of her misery and into the life she always longed for. 
Phase two: Hope. This woman knew the real thing when she saw it. Suddenly she knew that despite her past, her future could be different; she seized her moment! When Jesus said, '...the water I give them takes away thirst altogether. It becomes a perpetual spring, giving them eternal life.' 'Please, sir,' the woman said, 'give me some of that water!...' (John 4:14-15 NLT). She reached by faith and received what He had for her. Then redeemed, recycled and redirected, this woman with a questionable past went back to her village to tell other people about Jesus 
You know something - what Jesus did for her He'll do for you. What He said to her He says to you: 'Your time has come. Your breakthrough is at hand. Believe it, receive it and walk in it.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE DULLER THE AXE THE HARDER THE WORK</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 10:10 TM</span><br>Did you hear about the two lumberjacks who challenged each other to see which one could cut down more trees in a day? At daybreak the first one began furiously chopping down trees. He worked up a sweat and by noon he had cut down eight trees. Meanwhile the other lumberjack had only cut down four, because he took the first two hours to sharpen his axe. As he sharpened it, his challenger laughed at him thinking 'Why is he wasting so much time - he's handed me this contest on a plate!&quot; That's when things got interesting. By early afternoon the first lumberjack was slowing down. It took him almost an hour to cut down one tree, while the second guy was picking up speed. The first lumberjack started to get worried. He was definitely as strong as this other guy. But strength wasn't the deciding factor. It was all about whose axe was sharper. The sharper the axe the quicker the trees came down. By late afternoon the second lumberjack who'd sharpened his axe, had taken the lead by several trees and won easily. 
There's an important lesson there for you. Your striving to get stuff done in your own strength may work for a while, but eventually it will leave you dull; emotionally and mentally. It's up to you to make sure you don't lose your edge and miss what God has for you next! So are you getting the message, don't be in a rush to jump straight in to everything. You may just need to hang back for a while and make sure that before you start God sharpens you up for the job!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...STOOP DOWN...TO THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:2 TM </span><br>In the early days of the Special Olympics, nine competitors lined up to run the 100m dash. Everyone took off, eagerly but one soon stumbled, and fell. A couple of the others saw it happen.  They stopped, turned around and helped him up.  Then they all proceeded to cross the finish line together.  It was a totally unique sporting moment. Nothing like that is going to happen in the regular Olympics! Some years ago a sports magazine carried the photo of a famous woman runner, holding her leg in agony after falling on the track as the others raced past her. What made the Special Olympic runners come back for their friend who'd fallen? Because they realized that they had weaknesses too. They knew it could have been any one of them lying there on the track, so they reached out to him. In a very real sense the three runners who came in last deserved the medals that day. If the runners in the regular Olympics had gone back to the woman who fell, helped her up, then crossed the finish line together, they may not have won. But they would have grown as human beings that day. God is more interested in our growth, than in the medals we win for ourselves. Are you getting the idea? We only grow in grace as we run together, stopping to lift and encourage each other along the way, and finish victoriously together. That's why it's so important for you to be connected to, and committed to, a local church where being a Christian is more than just a spectator sport!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I SAW A VISION...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 11:5 NIV</span><br>Before others catch the vision, it's born in the heart of one person. That's the way it's always been, even if we go back 4000 years. Before one Hebrew slave caught the vision of the Promised Land, Moses 'saw' it. He saw his people no longer bound by chains, free to build homes, grow crops and worship God. But his vision was clouded by frustration and anger. Time in the desert helped him to see things more clearly.  The Bible says: '...he persevered because he saw him who is invisible' (Hebrews 11:27 NIV). For many years Moses was sustained by what he saw. And your vision, if it's of God, will also sustain you through the desert times.  
God often gives a vision bigger than we are. Then He'll gather a team around that vision - people with different strengths and abilities. He gave Joshua to Moses to be his young assistant. He gave him Aaron to speak persuasively and Miriam to lead worship. He gave him his father-in-law, Jethro, to save him from a leader's most dreaded fate - death by admin. Finally He gave him 70 more leaders with the right 'spirit' to complete the job. Moses was a unique guy with a unique job to do. This story is an amazing inspiration - and not because he was perfect. No, Moses struggled with being human too. But he allowed his life to be used for God's higher purposes. He knew his life had no point if it wasn't fully available for Him. When you surrender your life to God you'll discover something wonderful - God's not limited by your limitations!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE WALK BY FAITH, NOT BY SIGHT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 5:7 NAS</span><br>The reason many of us aren't growing spiritually is because our faith doesn't reach beyond our sight. Real faith begins where our senses end. When we can see how something will happen, we usually don't feel the need to trust God for it. And since we can't see very far, living by sight keeps us living small. 
Think of the African impala; it's an amazing deer-like animal that can leap 10 foot (3m) high and 30 (9m) feet out with just one jump. But did you know that you can put that impala in a three-foot (90cm) high cage with no roof and it will not even try to escape, even though it has more than enough power to clear the cage. That's because the impala won't jump if it cannot see where its feet are going to land. The impala lives by sight, so it's easy to keep it caged. The same goes for you! 
But having faith isn't just about a blind belief in anything! Some children believe in the Tooth Fairy but that doesn't make it real. FAITH MUST BE BASED ON TRUTH. As Christians we CAN say 'God, I know that whenever You speak You're telling the truth, and I can stake my life on it.' Faith establishes what we believe about God. Too many of us act like we've more confidence in ourselves than we do in Him. If faith is the decision to grab hold of the power and promises of God, then if our faith is lacking we won't see the supernatural work of God in our lives - and we'll live in the natural with all its limitations.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHEN A BELIEVING PERSON PRAYS, GREAT THINGS HAPPEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:16 NCV</span><br>The Book of Mark says: 'Four men arrived carrying a paralysed man on a mat. They couldn't get to Jesus through the crowd, so they dug through the clay roof above his head...they lowered the sick man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralysed man, &quot;My child, your sins are forgiven&quot;' (Mark 2:3-5 NLT). The word prayer doesn't show up once in this paragraph. But look closely and you'll see it in action; four men lowering their sick mate through the roof into the presence of Jesus. He stops preaching, looks at the man and then announces, 'My child, your sins are forgiven.' What stirred Jesus? Mark answers, 'Seeing their faith.' The faith of four friends triggered Jesus' power on his behalf. This guy had no movement, no treatment, no answers, and no hope. But what he does have is friends who know how to lift him into the presence of Jesus. The paralytic might be thinking 'don't drop me!' The homeowner might be groaning 'I never asked for an extreme makeover on my roof! But Jesus? He was smiling! Their faith stirred His strength. He healed the man. The paralytic left the house with a clean soul and strong body. Faithful friends carry those they love in prayer, into God's presence. And when they do God responds. How? When? The four men didn't know. And we don't know either, but we know this: 'When a believing person prays, great things happen.' So be that kind of friend. Go ahead, carry your loved ones into the presence of Jesus, then watch what happens!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE GREW UP...LIKE A ROOT OUT OF DRY GROUND...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 53:2 NIV</span><br>Isaiah points out that Jesus sprang up '...like a root out of dry ground...' Now there are not many plants that can 'spring up' when there's no water. That is a hard thing to do. So what was Isaiah talking about? He was talking about the fact that it was seriously tough for Jesus to 'spring up'. God left heaven, got dressed up in a man's body, lived among a bunch of people who wanted to kill Him, lived in a nasty environment filled with betrayers and religious hypocrites and battled it out with satan. Unsurprisingly, Jesus had to get away a lot - not far away - just into some private space with His Father. Jesus needed to physically separate Himself from what was going on, even though He was involved emotionally and spiritually. How do you live a perfect life in a place where your own people despise, reject and ultimately crucify you? Jesus spent loads of time in prayer and always came back encouraged and ready for battle. Jesus always kept one thing in mind: He came to do His Father's will. That was His thing, it got Him through and it put Him on the cross. It was Jesus' main focus, top priority and by sticking to that 100% He never went wrong, not even once. Jesus also said that as the Father had sent Him, '&quot;...so send I you&quot;' (John 20:21 KJV). How's that for  challenge? Not only was it Jesus' job to do God's will, it's ours too! That should be OUR focus, OUR top priority and by sticking to that we can't go far wrong either!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:17 KJV</span><br>Prayer's not a monologue where one person does all the talking, or a ritual where we've got to say things in the right order, or a job to get out of the way like brushing our teeth before going bed. So how does Jesus teach prayer? '&quot;...Find a quiet, secluded place so you won't be tempted to role-play before God. Just be there as simply and honestly as you can manage. The focus will shift from you to God, and you will begin to sense His grace&quot;' (Matthew 6:6 TM). For loads of people, prayer has nothing to do with real life. They think of it like the National Anthem at a footie game: a nice opening, but nothing to do with what happens on the pitch afterwards. Other people treat prayer like a lucky charm you pull out and rub when things are tough: 'A prayer a day keeps the devil away.' Paul writes, 'Pray without ceasing.' Man that's a lot of prayer! That definitely isn't something you do once in a while, or something you have to remember to say before bed. Try sticking the word breathe there instead of pray: 'breathe without ceasing' - there are not many people who can manage that for long! We don't breathe only when we feel like it; or decide, 'I can't be bothered with oxygen today,' and stop breathing. We don't get frustrated and say, 'This isn't getting me anywhere. I'm not going to do it any more.' No, we cling to the breath in our bodies like it's life. So, just as breathing isn't an optional part of your natural life, prayer isn't an optional part of your spiritual life. Without it you die spiritually. So, how's your prayer life?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IT IS [GOD] THAT GIVES YOU THE ABILITY [IDEAS AND CREATIVITY] TO PRODUCE WEALTH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 8:18 NIV</span><br>Do you want your life to count in God's big plan for the planet? 
1) GET SERIOUSLY CREATIVE: When God gives you the ability to succeed, it often begins as an idea. But remember you have to do something with that idea, make a plan, talk to people, get it done! Your idea (or someone else's) might come from God. Stop and think: if God's a creator and we are made in His likeness, shouldn't we be creative too?
2) GET USING YOUR GIFTS: The gift God gave you is your key to success. He didn't give it to you to be wasted on stuff that has no point or purpose or denied out of a false sense of humility. No, He gave it to you to be invested-to be used! Jesus told the story of three blokes who were given money to invest. The first two doubled theirs; the third buried his in the ground because he was afraid of messing it up. Look out! Fear is one of your greatest enemies. It numbs your spirit and bangs up your creativity. Use what God's given you. Trust God and take some risks. 
3) GET ON WITH IT!: OK, sometimes it's wise to wait. But lots of the time being over cautious will just lead to missed opportunities, disappointments and regrets. Your friends and leaders can help you work this out. But if you know in your 'knower' that God has told you do something for Him, if you've got the ideas and the gifts, don't make excuses, get on with it! Make it happen. Seize the day. Grab the 'now' moments of your life - the 'right time' you're waiting for may never arrive.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I HAVE FINISHED MY COURSE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 4:7 KJV</span><br>Be yourself. Life's too short to be anything else. Paul said 'I have finished my course.' It's important that you run the race God gave you (not many sprinters try to win marathons!!). Have you ever seen the movie 'Catch Me If You Can'?  It's based on a true story. Frank Abagnale Jr lived a mad life as a doctor, airline pilot, lawyer and celebrity (collecting bucks and babes on the way.) But it was all a con. He might deserve an Oscar for all his frontin', but the truth is he was a fraud. It all began early in his life when he realized he'd the talent to convince people he was 'somebody' through his sheer confidence and acting ability. He began to make shed loads of cash and soon found himself addicted to faking it. Before it was over he'd helped perform surgery in an operating room, conned banks out of thousands of dollars, flown an airplane as a pilot, and gone places most people only dream of going. The problem was - it was all a show. A few years into it he wanted out. The glamour was gone. He was desperate to come clean and be real. But he had created such a web of lies that it wasn't easy. The FBI was onto him, and he ended up spending years in prison. Frank had a great talent, but he wasted it pretending to be someone else. Sometimes it's easier to put on a front but God's blessing will only be seen in your life when you're committed to being who He called you to be. To live any other way is to be lonely, fearful and unfulfilled. So, be yourself!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHAT IS YOUR LIFE? YOU ARE A MIST THAT APPEARS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN VANISHES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 4:14 NIV</span><br>Coral reefs are the earth's oldest living organisms, some have been alive for a hundred thousand years. Certain olive trees in the Mediterranean live for over 1000 years. Most other living things burn out much more quickly. Bowhead whales can live up to 200 years. Giant turtles are still young at 100. 'What about me?' If you lived in Africa you might not make 50, but in Europe you should hit 70 at least. That sounds pretty good if you're young, but it soon starts slipping away when you get past the half-way point! The Bible says your life is like a mist, and mists aren't known for their permanence; just a puff of little breeze and there gone! So why are you still waiting? You don't have forever, get at it!
You say you've always wanted to play the piano; stop talking about it and start taking lessons! Or that you've always dreamed of going on a mission to Africa; so get in touch with a mission agency. You say you hate your bedroom wallpaper. Quit complaining; scrape it off and paint it the colour you like! You say you feel better when you exercise; start jogging! Or that you're angry about the way your local newspaper always prints bad news about young people; so write them a letter! 
If you flick back right to the beginning of your Bible you'll see that there was once a time when God allowed people to live 10 times longer than they do now. But that time is long since over.  So get out of neutral and get going! Put your life into God's hands and let Him show you what He can do with it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;THE WORD OF THE LORD WILL LIVE FOREVER...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 1:25 NCV</span><br>Voltaire, the French sceptic, once wrote from his Paris office: 'I will go through the forest of Scripture and girdle all the trees so that in one hundred years Christianity will be but a vanishing memory.' In a hilarious twist of divine irony, the room he wrote that in was later bought by the British and Foreign Bible Society and packed with Bibles. What book can possibly be a rival to the Bible? Some people are impressed by the Best Selling book charts. The Da Vinci Code has remained near the top of this chart for a few years now. But what if a book is Number One for 300 years? Your Bible is the most widely published and translated book in history - available in over 2000 different dialects. Why? Because it works! Put it's words into action in any part of your life and see what happens. a) apply it to your finances. Manage your money the way the Bible says: give, save, give to the needy, don't waste it. Give it a try and see the results b) try it where you spend you days, in work or at school or college. Follow the Bible's code of work conduct. Be honest. Be on time. Be efficient. You may just do very well! c) test the Bible on your relationships. Forgive your enemies. Refuse to diss other people. Do all you can to be at peace with everyone. Be quick to listen and slow to speak d) but most of all, apply the Bible to your soul. '...There's nothing like the written Word of God for showing you the way to salvation...' (2 Timothy 3:15 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;THE WORD OF THE LORD WILL LIVE FOREVER...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 1:25 NCV</span><br>Imagine a museum of art commissions a painting to be painted by 40 different artists. They work in their different studios with know idea what everyone else was doing. Yet when all 40 canvasses are put together on one wall like a giant jigsaw, they create the perfect landscape. What are the chances? Or imagine 40 architects set out to design one building. Some of them know what others are doing - others are clueless that anyone else is doing anything at all. When they gather to put together notes, the result is a magnificent blueprint. Doesn't sound likely does it? But it did with the Bible. William Gladstone, Prime Minister of England, stated: 'I have known 95 great men in my time. And of these, 87 were followers of the Bible.'  No publisher commissioned the Bible. No committee outlined it. No earthly editor oversaw it. Though separated by 16 centuries, and written by a random assortment of kings, soldiers, shepherds, farmers and fishermen, from Moses in the Arabian desert to John on the windswept island of Patmos - one theme threads the Bible together. That theme is eternal life through Jesus Christ. Your Bible is the most incredible book ever written. Each day that passes validates Peter's prophecy: 'The Word of the Lord will live forever.' The question is: does it live in your heart? Does it affect how you live? Does it set your priorities? Do you hunger for it? Can you say 'Oh how I love your law! I meditate on it all day long' (Psalm 119:97 NIV)?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE OLD HAS GONE, THE NEW HAS COME!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 5:17 NIV</span><br>What loads of us haven't yet grasped is that God really isn't trying to polish you up to make you better. When a car gets to a certain state, you have to start thinking, 'is it really worth repairing, or would I be better getting a new one? Not many people go to the effort of doing up a beat up old banger! When we became Christians, God decided to scrap the old us. It wasn't worth trying to repair the broken bits, so he scrapped it and gave us a brand spanking new, top of the range life - with all the special features! We've got an insurance policy for life, fuel that will never run out, no speed limit - we can go as far and as fast as we want to. 
God doesn't want us to try to use will power, or guilt or pure effort to live a new life. He wants us to have the best. The life God has for us is unfailing, everlasting and the best you can get. When God asks you to work on something in your life, don't try to fix an old problem, throw it away and fill yourself with Jesus. Focus on Him and accept you are new, you don't have to do that old stuff anymore, you don't have to live with that old problem anymore. You can live a new life, a new way.  Paul writes, 'For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose' (Philippians 2:13 NIV). Our job is just to get as close as you can to God and do what He asks.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUT IT IS NOT SO AMONG YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 10:43 NAS</span><br>Wouldn't it be ace if just being around humble people automatically made us humble. The disciples proved it didn't. In the Bible, Mark tells a story involving James and John, two brothers; a story that makes most parents nod and smile. It happened before John got all mature - still a disciple, still young, and still not quite getting it: '...James and John...came to Him...&quot;Teacher...Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in glory.'' Jesus replied: &quot;You don't know what you are asking...&quot;' (Mark 10:35-38 NIV). Then He got the disciples together and said, '&quot;...You've observed how godless rulers throw their weight around, he said, and when people get a little power how quickly it goes to their heads. It's not going to be that way with you...&quot;' (Mark 10:42-43 TM). Our world is run by chain of command. In workplaces there can be Directors, Executives, Managers, Team Leaders and then everybody else. Jesus barely took a breath after comparing the two kingdoms, then added, 'It's not going to be that way with you.' In God's Kingdom there's no ladder to climb. The poor don't pamper the privileged - quite the opposite. Once He got their attention, Jesus spelled it out, '&quot;...whoever wishes to be great...shall be your servant&quot;' (Mark. 10:43 NAS). Genuinely humble people have one thing in common - they don't think of themselves as humble! In fact, they rarely think of themselves at all! They're too busy with doing what God wants and looking after others. So, do you practice humility?

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...TO HIM BE GLORY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 PETER 3:18 NIV</span><br>After writing, 'Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord...' Peter adds: '...To him be glory...' Ever thought about what that means? We all want to grow and get good at stuff to have people admire us but, actually, our reason for growing should be totally for God's glory! Paul writes, '...glorify God in your body, and in your spirit...' (1 Corinthians 6:20 KJV). Why does it matter how we live, what we do and how people see us? Because we're supposed to reflect God's glory! The problem is, we're always focussed on what we're doing instead of God and His glory. Imagine 50,000 fans at Old Trafford singing 'Glory, Glory, Man Utd' at the tops of their voices; well the way we act should be like a there's a huge crowd around us singing 'Glory, Glory, Jesus Christ!' It should be really obvious in all we do that God's glory just flows out of us. So what are we supposed to do? Draw attention to God. Promote Him. God wants to go public. Since He's invisible, He's created people whose full time job is to make Him visible so that everyone can see Him. Companies who want to be seen don't just stick a one-liner in the yellow pages, they go for prime time TV. We are billboards advertising God's grace to a screwed up world. He wants us to grow so that we can display Him more. In fact, God has trusted us with His public image. Bigging up God is our most awesome privilege and responsibility. Think we're exaggerating? Paul writes, 'Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;I AM THE BREAD OF LIFE. HE WHO COMES TO ME WILL NEVER GO HUNGRY...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 6:35 NIV</span><br>Imagine finding a new bakery. You love going there because the baker creates amazing sandwiches, pasties and cakes, better than any you've ever tasted. Soon word gets out and crowds start gathering. The baker doesn't have enough help and ends up trying to serve all the customers herself. Gradually you see a change. She's getting thin. Very thin! What's up? You decide to sit and watch. Suddenly the problem becomes obvious. She's busy serving everyone else but never stops long enough to feed herself. Even with food all around her, she's starving. Can you relate? This is a problem which loads of people have, they spend so much time looking after, teaching, serving, encouraging and doing things for other people that they never stop to take time out for themself! If this is something you recognise in yourself or people you're close to, it's your job to do something about it! This is what Jesus did: 'After He had dismissed the multitude, He went up into the hills by Himself to pray...' (Matthew 14:23 AMP). Jesus spent time with God, he knew it was total priority. If it's you, take some time out, be with Jesus. If it's a family member, try to talk to them or even find a way to free up some time for them! Tell your mum to put her feet up while you make tea. Offer to do the shopping or wash the car. If it's a leader, tell them they need time out and the rest of you will survive without them for one day. Who ever it is, take action!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE WILL YET FILL YOUR MOUTH WITH LAUGHTER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOB 8:21 NIV</span><br>One of the best ways to reduce stress, is to keep your sense of humour. Don't panic, don't overreact, and don't use unnecessary force. If you do people will avoid you. Happy people get more done than their oh-so-serious counterparts. Actually, being joyful can make a total difference to life, how you see it and how people are with you. Would you rather buy something from a stressed-out, mardy or nasty salesman, or someone who's good to be around? Would you rather hang out with someone who's worrying or moaning or miserable or someone that'll always cheer you up? 'A cheerful heart is good medicine...' (Proverbs 17:22 NIV). However, remember these things when it comes to humour: Make sure your jokes are at no one else's expense. Don't make jokes about things that people might be sensitive about. Weight, bad hairdos and being a bit slow might make some people laugh, but to the people being joked about, even if they laughed it probably hurt them inside. No one likes to be the butt of the joke. Be careful with teasing and don't joke about people you don't really like as a sly way of undermining them. It is not a good thing to turn every one and everything into a joke. It's always wise to let the joke be on you; you know you're not going to offend yourself! So don't be a joker all the time, there are times when it's just not appropriate. Love people; if they know you love them, they'll love to laugh with you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PLEASANT WORDS ARE...HEALING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 16:24 NIV</span><br>Tom had a rough time in school. He just couldn't keep up. Eventually his teacher gave up on him, called his mum and told her to take him home because he couldn't learn and would never amount to much. But Tom's mum had a different opinion - she was a nurturer; she believed in him. She taught him at home, and every time he screwed up she gave him hope and encouraged him to keep trying.
Tom grew up and became an inventor creating all sorts of things including the electric light bulb! Yeah, you guessed right - his name was Thomas Edison. How good is that? When people have love and hope, there's no telling how far they can go! Solomon writes: 'Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.' So, what about your words? Do they build up or tear down? How do people feel when they're around you? Do they feel small and rubbish, or do they want to be around you because you make them feel they can be somebody? The Bible is the ultimate book of hope. It tells us that Jonah got a second chance to go back to Nineveh and the whole city turned to God (see Jonah 3:1); that the Prodigal Son came back from a wasted life and was restored to his family (see Luke 15:11); and that Peter, the man who screwed over his best friend and Lord, became an awesome leader in the New Testament church. Do you want to become great in God's Kingdom? Become an encourager, a nurturer, and a restorer!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 4:9 NIV</span><br>Who protects you? When the Christians in Jerusalem wanted nothing to do with the newly converted Saul of Tarsus, Barnabas acted on his behalf. You don't have enough voices. You need others to speak up for you. Who shares your tears? Mary of Bethany was the only person in the room who understood what Jesus was going through as He came closer to His hour of death. Only she shared His tears. Who's close to you? Close enough to pick up on the signals, to sense when fears and tears need to be shared? Sure, there are times when we need a kick up the bum, but there are also times when we need to be encouraged to lie low, to process our emotions. Who does that for you? Who challenges you? Is somebody able to say 'you shouldn't have done that'? Even with 20/20 vision, one pair of eyes is not enough. You have blind spots. Satan is always ready to remind you of your faults and failings. But a true friend is the one who exposes and challenges any selfishness, self-dependence, and helps you to give God back the control over your life. Who has a laugh with you? Does this sound wrong, even sinful? What! You must never let the seriousness of life overrule your having fun and chilling out, actually enjoying life! Who seeks God with you? Praying together keeps us honest. It also keeps us dependent on God. We don't wanna open up, to get real about our areas of struggle. Yet it's only in the honesty of shared prayer that we move closer to God - and to one another.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 4:9 NIV</span><br>Father Edward Farrell said, 'Listening is rare. There are certain people to whom we feel we can talk because they have such a deep capacity for hearing, not just our words, but hearing us as a person. They enable us to communicate on a level we've never reached before. They enable us to be as we've never been before. We will never truly know ourselves unless we find people who can listen, who can enable us to emerge, to come out of ourselves, to discover who we are. We cannot discover ourselves by ourselves.' Note the words 'There are certain people...who enable us to be as we have never been before.' Those are the people you need most. Think about these questions: Who coaches you? What older, wiser, and more experienced person stands watching, waving and encouraging you on? A coach doesn't try to run the race for you. No, he sets the standard for the race and tells you how you did. Who does this for you? Who stretches your mind? Who points out you're not quite as good as you like to think; who won't let you get away with being a muppet? Who listens to and encourages your dreams? Dreams often don't make sense, they're not supposed to. They're the work of visionaries; they are out-of-the-box, usually awful and occasionally good. These are the people who, when others laugh and say you're dreaming, you've got no hope, remind you that God '...calls those things which are not, as though they were' (see Romans 4:17 NIV). These are the people you need!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LIKE NEWBORN BABIES, LONG FOR THE PURE MILK OF THE WORD, THAT BY IT YOU MAY GROW...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 2:2 NAS</span><br>Babies cry. It's what they do. They cry and cry until the milk arrives! The fact that mum's tired and stressed doesn't matter. When that baby is ready to eat, the world stops. Peter calls the Bible 'pure milk,' which means it's full of wholesome goodness - none of that skimmed, watered down stuff. Pure milk is the opposite of a dummy, which looks real but provides no nourishment. Too many of us are not growing strong in God because we're feeding on substitutes. We've got a dummy stuck in and haven't realised there's no milk coming from it! Don't get fooled into accepting anything but the authentic, full fat truth of Scripture. Reading the W4 U2D each day is great, but it's only a snack, its no substitute for the Bible - your proper meal. Christian books and CD's are like nice treats, but not your balanced diet.  
What's more, babies don't drink for 2 hours on a Sunday morning, they're always feeding. Babies eat all the time for one reason - they're hungry. We don't feed on God's Word more because we're not hungry for it, we've settled for a dummy. Get this: without a big fat daily plateful of God's Word, you'll end up stunted, weak and very, very vulnerable. We need to remind ourselves what's good for us. Even if you'd prefer a snack, get your staple food first. And if you struggle to understand it, get another version! There are loads of versions of the Bible written in different styles, yes, even ones you can understand! Today's lesson; take out the dummy and get the milk.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WAIT FOR THE LORD; BE STRONG...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 27:14 NRS</span><br>If you've been on a load of planes, chances are you're familiar with the term 'holding pattern.' That's when your plane can't land because of bad ground conditions. Generally the pilot announces that he's been told to maintain a holding pattern while waiting an update from the control tower. It happens regularly, so planes have to carry enough fuel to stay airborne till they can land safely. The Bible says, 'Wait for the Lord; be strong...let your heart take courage...' When God puts you in a holding pattern it's not just a question of having enough faith to receive His promise, it's also a matter of having enough 'spiritual staying power' to stay airborne until your day comes. That's why you need to carry enough spiritual fuel to handle delays and wait for clearance.
The Bible refers to the Holy Spirit as '...a rushing mighty wind...' (Acts 2:2 KJV). Anytime a wind comes from the presence of God it blows away anything that was in its path, it dries the ground under your feet so you can move ahead. It gets rid of the spirit of fear and even frustration that makes you want to quit. 
David asked God, '...Why do you take care of human beings?' (Psalm 8:4 NCV). Even in times of frustration and waiting, God is still thinking about you and working everything out for your good. His delays aren't denials. So, when your spirit senses a change in the wind, be happy, it's a sign that He's clearing you to land and good things are about to happen!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;NOT BY MIGHT NOR BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ZECHARIAH 4:6 NIV </span><br>Somebody has said that patience is the quality you admire in the driver behind, but not the guy in front! We need to understand this patience principle if we're going to get through life without going nuts. Some things take time, they can't be done '&quot;...by might, nor...power...&quot;' So how are they done? '&quot;...by my spirit...&quot;' David said, 'My times are in Your hands...' (Psalm 31:15 NIV). David understood that nobody can short circuit God's plan for you. Once you realise that, you find peace - and stop trying to 'make things happen.' When God drops a seed into your life it needs time to take root and grow. And you don't have to be worried about the how's and the when's, because when it's planted in a fertile, faith-filled heart, the results are guaranteed. The hard part is knowing that you're on the verge of a breakthrough, then having God tell you to wait. It's when you think He's forgotten you and every second feels like a lifetime, that your patience gets a some serious exercise. David said: 'I waited patiently for the Lord...and...He...set my feet on solid ground and [gave] me...a hymn of praise...' (Psalm 40:1-3 NLT). When you honour God's timing, you always land on solid ground, and end up with a reason to praise Him.
So, when you know you've a call from God but He puts you on hold, stay on the line till He gets back to you. It's well worth waiting to get your answer directly from Him. Think about it! Would you dare trust any other answer?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DON'T TRY TO GET OUT OF ANYTHING PREMATURELY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:4 TM</span><br>The Bible says, 'To every thing there is a season...' (Ecclesiastes 3:1 KJV). So no matter how hard you pray, you can't pray your life's seasons away. There are some situations you aren't meant to change - you're just meant to survive! Paul calls these times, '...light and momentary troubles...' (2 Corinthians 4:17 NIV). When you can't change your circumstances you've just got to learn to grow through them.
In winter, trees take advantage of the season to rebuild their strength and prepare to be fruitful next season. Their sap and substance goes underground. Then in the spring it pushes its way back up again in the form of new growth. Looking back over your life you'll find that your achievements are seasonal. Growth comes, then struggle, and so on. Each season has its purpose. God has a reason for not wanting you to be productive all the time. When He lets wintry weather to blow through your life He's getting you ready for spring. James writes, 'Consider it a...gift...when tests...come... under pressure, your faith...shows its true colours. So don't try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way.' One of the issues you'll struggle with in a winter waiting time is the urge to hurry, to make big permanent decisions based on circumstances that are about to change. Don't do it! Every situation doesn't need immediate action. Remember, patience comes from trust, and you can't trust a God you don't know. That's why you need to spend more time getting chilling out with Him and reading His instruction manual.  ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT GET DRUNK ON WINE...INSTEAD, BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 5:18 NIV</span><br>When you're offered an alcoholic drink, you'll very often hear someone say 'go on then, I'll just have one'. It wouldn't be unusual to them see that person at the end of the evening, staggering about, shouting, laughing, crying, singing or even throwing up. So why is that? Isn't it obvious? Alcohol affects your judgement. When you're sober you can decide to 'just have one', but once you had one you've got the taste for it and fancy another 'Oooh, just one more!', before long nothing seems to matter any more! Basically the alcohol controls you. That's why we say you're 'under the influence', because something else is running the show. And what alcohol is to your body negatively, the Holy Spirit is to you positively. When you're under His control, He makes you walk in ways you wouldn't normally walk, and talk in ways you wouldn't normally talk. That's why, rather than spending our time and energy trying to change ourselves, we need to concentrate on being - and staying - filled with God's Spirit. You see, if you're sober you may not do karaoke, but if you're drunk you probably will! So if you want to change something about you but can't or daren't, you get filled with Gods spirit, and then you can! But a word of caution: those under the influence of the Holy Spirit will not be nasty or rude, selfish or showing off trying to impress people. No, the Holy Spirit is a gentleman. The power He provides is a controlled life that you can't get any other way. And that power is available to you today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;IT FELT LIKE A FIRE BURNING IN US WHEN JESUS...EXPLAINED THE SCRIPTURES TO US.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 24:32 NCV</span><br>Shortly after Jesus died he appeared to two of his followers on the road to Emmaus. They were totally broken-hearted: '...sadness [was] written across their faces' (Luke 24:17 NLT). In fact they were in so much pain, they didn't even click who Jesus was. He'd risen from the dead, and even though they hadn't realised, He'd come to take their sorrow. And how did He do this? A quick prayer? Did He leap out a tree shouting 'tadaaaa!!!!?'  '...Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself' (Luke 24:27 NLT). He talked to them about the Bible! He chose the one thing that never fails - God's Word! Did it make a difference? For those two it did: 'It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us.' Trying to live a powerful Christian life without a daily dose of the Scriptures is like trying to run your car without petrol, work on an empty stomach, or pay for the cinema with a blockbuster card, it just won't work. 
Reading the Bible each day reminds us what's true; it's like medication you need each day - a dose of reality. The world is so easy to get caught up in and soon a little problem can seem like an enormous life or death situation. The Bible helps us to keep perspective, to keep our eyes fixed on what's important and not freak out at every little thing. God's got your life in hand, you just need to make sure you never forget that. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:6 NIV</span><br>
'Faith that pleases God is acting like it's done, even when it's not, just so that it will be; because God said so!' That statement sounds a little bit like it's saying pretend something's real when it's not. But no, it's saying even when there's no evidence for what God said, believe it anyway. So here's a challenge, how do you know whether you believe what God said? Well if you believe, you do it! Maybe you think people like Noah had it easier than we do because God spoke to them directly. True, God did speak to them, but that didn't make their obedience any easier. Remember, Noah worked for years building a boat with no water around him, and kept telling everyone a flood was coming, just because God said! Even though we can see it all worked out ok for guys like Noah, we still experience the turbulence of life. Ever been on an airplane when it started shaking or dipping suddenly without warning? Remember how you felt when the captain spoke over the intercom, calmly explaining that this was no big deal. Your options were to have faith in the captain - or believe what you saw and felt. Depending on your choice, you either white-knuckled the rest of your flight, or relaxed and enjoyed it. Faith takes you beyond the limits of your logic, reason and senses. It lets you believe that if God said it, it's true. Basically, faith is acting as if God is telling the truth. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...CHRIST LIVES IN ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 2:20 NIV</span><br>Your identity is worth loads not only to you, but also to the thief who wants your name and bank details. Loads of us, especially when we're young go to huge lengths to create an identity that a certain group will like. It might be a chav, a mosher, a goth, a townie, a skater look or even a combination of different looks. Your look may include piercing, certain types of designer gear, certain hair styles, mountains of bling weighing you down or even charity shop retro gear. Whatever group you identify best with and want to be most like, chances are it goes deeper than 'you just like that look'. One of the biggest challenges young people face today is that of self image. We don't know who we are and we're not even sure who we're supposed to be! Girls have the extremes of the 'well rounded' Jordan look or the skinny Keira Knightley look. Boys can go for the well groomed Rio Ferdinand style or be an Indie rock star with shaggy hair - and everything in between! But real identity goes much deeper and it can only be found in God. Once you've figured out who He made you to be, your identity is totally secure. You don't have to conform, change, dress or act a certain way. So who are you? You're a totally forgiven, fully accepted, deeply loved, created in His image, beautiful and incredible child of God. Once you fully grasp that, you'll have a satisfaction inside like you've never known before!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...BEWARE THAT IN YOUR PLENTY YOU DO NOT FORGET THE LORD...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 8:11 NLT</span><br>A spider dropped a single strand down from the rafter of an old barn and began to weave her web. Months went by and the web grew. Its elaborate maze caught flies, mosquitoes and other small insects, providing the spider with a delicious feast. Eventually all the others spiders got really jealous of it. Then one day the spider noticed a single strand stretching up into the rafters. 'I wonder why it's there? It doesn't catch me any dinner.' The spider decided it was unnecessary and looked messy and climbed as high as she could to cut it off. In that moment the entire web began to fall in upon itself, tumbling to the floor, taking the spider with it. 
Do you think it's possible that we sometimes make that same mistake? In a well known song by Matt Redman one line sings 'every blessing you pour out I'll turn back to praise'. It's very easy to pray and  thank God for the little when times are tough and we can see Him clearly at work but what about when things get comfy, when life's great and we've all we need and then some? Is it possible that like the spider we can actually make the mistake of forgetting who provided all we have? Do we get so smug and reliant on ourselves that we totally forget the strand that supports us? We're not the first to suffer from amnesia, the whole nation of Israel did it too, and Moses warned them: '&quot;...Beware that in your plenty you do not forget the Lord your God and disobey His commands...I assure you of this: if you ever forget the Lord your God...you will certainly be destroyed&quot;' (Deuteronomy 8:11 &amp; 19 NLT).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;I WILL...PUT A NEW SPIRIT IN YOU...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EZEKIEL 36:26 NIV</span><br>Everyone knows that when a woman becomes pregnant she has cravings she never had before. And when God saves you, He places within you new desires and appetites. This new nature is desperate for fellowship with God; it wants to please Him more than anything. These are intense cravings, which is why, when we sin, we can't enjoy it. Oh, you'll still 'blow it,' but it'll cause an intense struggle in your soul 'cause now you have to try and ignore what you really want. Paul writes: '...Let the Holy Spirit lead you in each step. Then you will not please your sinful old selves.' (Galatians 5:16 NLV). The order is crucial here, because loads of us get it backwards. We think that if we can just stop doing what we want and start doing what God wants, then we can start walking in the Spirit. But it's just the opposite. It's the Holy Spirit doing His bit on the inside that produces spiritual victory on the outside. Everything we need to walk with God and do what He wants - is already within us! If you get a cold and go to the doctor asking for a cure he'll send you away empty-handed; everything you need to fight the virus is already in you. There are no medicines for a cold, the cure lies in your body. Are you looking for strength and grace to obey God and do what's right? It's already right there! Everything you need for victorious Christian living was put in you the day you accepted Jesus. Just tap into it!]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 46:10 NIV	</span><br>A news reporter once found himself unprepared for a television interview with Mother Teresa. It went a bit like this: 'When you pray,' asked the reporter, 'what do you say to God?'   'I don't say anything,' she replied. 'I listen.' He tried another tack. 'Well, okay...when God speaks to you, then, what does He say?'   'He doesn't say anything. He listens.' He looked bewildered. For an instant, he didn't know what to say. 'And if you don't understand that,' Mother Teresa added, 'I can't explain it to you.' 
Here's a secret, this is how wise people get wise! It's in the place of silence that the Holy Spirit takes the truths in the Bible and suddenly helps us to understand exactly what they mean! Not only that but then he shows them how they fit in with our lives, where we've been going wrong and this changes us. As He transforms our heart to beat in time with His, our decisions are right at the heart of His plan and we begin to reflect His character. Go ahead, try it. Open the Word of God in a peaceful place and sit in quietness before Him. In time, the Holy Spirit will illuminate a passage and it will come to life in your mind. Before you know it the messed up situation that drove you mad will unravel. As you learn to 'be still' in God's presence, your greatest problems will suddenly become more manageable. He will reveal Himself to you. He will calm your emotions and relieve your mind. You'll discover new direction, freedom from worry, and a fresh sense of peace. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;EACH TREE IS RECOGNISED BY ITS OWN FRUIT...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:44 NIV</span><br>The Titanic received five iceberg warnings just before it went down. When the 6th message came during the wee hours of the morning: 'Look out for icebergs!' The operator wired back 'Shut-up! I'm busy!' Thirty minutes later the great vessel - whose captain said, 'Even God couldn't sink this ship' - was sinking fast. What happened? They forgot the truth about icebergs. What they saw above the water couldn't have sunk the great ship but unfortunately most of an iceberg is below the water. Do you know what? That iceberg represents your life! The 10% above the water is how people see you and the 90% below is how you really are - your character. And it's what's below the surface that sinks your ship. So what's character? a) self-discipline - being able to do what's right, even when you don't feel like it b) core values - the way you live even when there is pressure to do something else c) sense of identity - a self-image based on who God, not others, says you are d) emotional security - the ability to be emotionally stable and consistent. The impact your life has comes from who you are, not what you have. Jesus said, '&quot;Each tree is recognised by its own fruit...The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart...&quot;' (Luke 6:44-45 NIV). Whatever's happening today on the outside of your life comes from what's happening on the inside. God cares about the inside as that affects what you do on the outside. Think about it!]]></introtext>
